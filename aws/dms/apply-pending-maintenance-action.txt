       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --replication-instance-arn <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the DMS resource that the  pending
          maintenance action applies to.

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: os-upgrade , system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A  value  that  specifies  the  type of opt-in request, or undoes an
          opt-in request. You can't undo an opt-in request of type immediate .

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance - Apply the maintenance action  during  the  next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in  -  Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance opt-in re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          The DMS resource that the pending maintenance action will be applied
          to.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  DMS  resource  that  the
              pending  maintenance  action  applies  to. For information about
              creating an ARN, see Constructing an Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)
              for DMS in the DMS documentation.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              Detailed information about the pending maintenance action.

              (structure)
                 Describes  a  maintenance action pending for an DMS resource,
                 including when and how it will be applied. This data type  is
                 a  response  element to the DescribePendingMaintenanceActions
                 operation.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The type of pending maintenance action that is  available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date of the maintenance window when the action is to
                     be applied. The maintenance action is applied to the  re-
                     source  during  its  first  maintenance window after this
                     date. If this date  is  specified,  any  next-maintenance
                     opt-in requests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The  date  when  the maintenance action will be automati-
                     cally applied. The maintenance action is applied  to  the
                     resource  on this date regardless of the maintenance win-
                     dow for the resource. If this date is specified, any  im-
                     mediate opt-in requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     The type of opt-in request that has been received for the
                     resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the  pending  maintenance  action
                     will be applied to the resource. This date takes into ac-
                     count opt-in requests received from the ApplyPendingMain-
                     tenanceAction  API operation, and also the AutoAppliedAf-
                     terDate and ForcedApplyDate parameter values. This  value
                     is  blank  if an opt-in request has not been received and
                     nothing has been specified  for  AutoAppliedAfterDate  or
                     ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
