NAME
       describe-replication-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  replication  tasks for your account in the
       current region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-replication-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReplicationTasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-tasks
          [--filters <value>]
          [--without-settings | --no-without-settings]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to replication tasks.

          Valid filter names: replication-task-arn | replication-task-id | mi-
          gration-type | endpoint-arn | replication-instance-arn

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --without-settings | --no-without-settings (boolean)
          An option to set to avoid returning information about settings.  Use
          this  to  reduce  overhead when setting information is too large. To
          use this option, choose true ;  otherwise,  choose  false  (the  de-
          fault).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                     is  an  improved  premigration task assessment operation.
                     The           `            StartReplicationTaskAssessment
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessment.html`__
                     operation assesses data type compatibility  only  between
                     the source and target database of a given migration task.
                     In    contrast,    `    StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun.html`__
                     enables you to specify a variety of premigration task as-
                     sessments  in  addition to data type compatibility. These
                     assessments include ones for the validity of primary  key
                     definitions  and  likely  issues  with database migration
                     performance, among others.

              LastFailureMessage -> (string)
                 The last error (failure) message generated for  the  replica-
                 tion task.

              StopReason -> (string)
                 The  reason  the  replication task was stopped. This response
                 parameter can return one of the following values:

                 o "STOP_REASON_FULL_LOAD_COMPLETED"  Full-load migration com-
                   pleted.

                 o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_APPLIED"   Change  data capture
                   (CDC) load completed.

                 o "STOP_REASON_CACHED_CHANGES_NOT_APPLIED"   In  a  full-load
                   and  CDC  migration, the full load stopped as specified be-
                   fore starting the CDC migration.

                 o "STOP_REASON_SERVER_TIME"  The  migration  stopped  at  the
                   specified server time.

              ReplicationTaskCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task was created.

              ReplicationTaskStartDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the replication task is scheduled to start.

              CdcStartPosition -> (string)
                 Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation
                 to start. Use  either  CdcStartPosition  or  CdcStartTime  to
                 specify  when you want the CDC operation to start. Specifying
                 both values results in an error.

                 The value can be in date, checkpoint, or LSN/SCN format.

                 Date Example: --cdc-start-position 2018-03-08T12:12:12

                 Checkpoint     Example:     --cdc-start-position      "check-
                 point:V1#27#mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1975:-1:2002:677883278264080:mysql-bin-changelog.157832:1876#0#0#*#0#93"

                 LSN               Example:               --cdc-start-position
                 mysql-bin-changelog.000024:373

              CdcStopPosition -> (string)
                 Indicates when you want a change data capture (CDC) operation
                 to stop. The value can be either server time or commit time.

                 Server        time        example:        --cdc-stop-position
                 server_time:2018-02-09T12:12:12

                 Commit   time   example:   --cdc-stop-position   commit_time:
                 2018-02-09T12:12:12

              RecoveryCheckpoint -> (string)
                 Indicates the last checkpoint that occurred during  a  change
                 data  capture  (CDC) operation. You can provide this value to
                 the CdcStartPosition parameter to start a CDC operation  that
                 begins at that checkpoint.

              ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication task.

              ReplicationTaskStats -> (structure)
                 The  statistics  for the task, including elapsed time, tables
                 loaded, and table errors.

                 FullLoadProgressPercent -> (integer)
                     The percent complete for the full load migration task.

                 ElapsedTimeMillis -> (long)
                     The elapsed time of the task, in milliseconds.

                 TablesLoaded -> (integer)
                     The number of tables loaded for this task.

                 TablesLoading -> (integer)
                     The number of tables currently loading for this task.
