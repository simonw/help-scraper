NAME
       modify-replication-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the replication instance to apply new settings. You can change
       one or more parameters by specifying these parameters and the new  val-
       ues in the request.

       Some settings are applied during the maintenance window.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --replication-instance-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The  amount of storage (in gigabytes) to be allocated for the repli-
          cation instance.

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Indicates whether the changes should be applied immediately or  dur-
          ing the next maintenance window.

       --replication-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and memory capacity of the replication instance as de-
          fined for the specified replication instance class. For  example  to
          specify  the  instance  class  dms.c4.large,  set  this parameter to
          "dms.c4.large" .

          For more information on the settings and capacities for  the  avail-
          able  replication  instance  classes,  see  Selecting  the right DMS
          replication instance for your migration .

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          Specifies the VPC security group to be used with the replication in-
          stance. The VPC security group must work with the VPC containing the
          replication instance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system  maintenance  can
          occur, which might result in an outage. Changing this parameter does
          not result in an outage, except in the following situation, and  the
          change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If moving this
          window to the current time, there must be at least  30  minutes  be-
          tween  the  current  time  and  end  of the window to ensure pending
          changes are applied.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies whether the replication instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.
          You can't set the AvailabilityZone parameter if the Multi-AZ parame-
          ter is set to true .

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version number of the replication instance.

          When modifying a major engine version of an instance, also  set  Al-
          lowMajorVersionUpgrade to true .

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this pa-
          rameter  does  not  result  in  an  outage,  and the change is asyn-
          chronously applied as soon as possible.

          This parameter must be set to true when specifying a value  for  the
          EngineVersion  parameter  that is a different major version than the
          replication instance's current version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates that minor version upgrades are applied auto-
          matically to the replication instance during the maintenance window.
          Changing  this  parameter doesn't result in an outage, except in the
          case described following. The change is  asynchronously  applied  as
          soon as possible.

          An outage does result if these factors apply:

          o This parameter is set to true during the maintenance window.

          o A newer minor version is available.

          o DMS has enabled automatic patching for the given engine version.

       --replication-instance-identifier (string)
          The  replication  instance identifier. This parameter is stored as a
          lowercase string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              address.  A value of false represents an instance with a private
              IP address. The default value is true .

          SecondaryAvailabilityZone -> (string)
