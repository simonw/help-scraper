DESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENDESCRIBE-REPLICATION-TASK-ASSESSMENT-RUNS()



NAME
       describe-replication-task-assessment-runs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a paginated list of premigration assessment runs based on fil-
       ter settings.

       These filter settings can specify a combination of premigration assess-
       ment  runs,  migration tasks, replication instances, and assessment run
       status values.

       NOTE:
          This operation doesn't return information about  individual  assess-
          ments. For this information, see the DescribeReplicationTaskIndivid-
          ualAssessments operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-task-assessment-runs
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-records <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters applied to the premigration assessment runs described in the
          form of key-value pairs.

          Valid  filter  names: replication-task-assessment-run-arn , replica-
          tion-task-arn , replication-instance-arn , status

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-records (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist than the specified MaxRecords value, a pagination to-
          ken called a marker is included in the response so that the  remain-
          ing results can be retrieved.

       --marker (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token returned for you to pass to a subsequent request.
          If  you pass this token as the Marker value in a subsequent request,
          the response includes only records beyond  the  marker,  up  to  the
          value specified in the request by MaxRecords .

       ReplicationTaskAssessmentRuns -> (list)
          One or more premigration assessment runs as specified by Filters .

          (structure)
              Provides  information  that  describes a premigration assessment
              run that you have started using the  StartReplicationTaskAssess-
              mentRun operation.

              Some  of  the information appears based on other operations that
              can return the ReplicationTaskAssessmentRun object.

              ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this assessment run.

              ReplicationTaskArn -> (string)
                 ARN of the migration task associated with  this  premigration
                 assessment run.

              Status -> (string)
                 Assessment run status.

                 This status can have one of the following values:

                 o "cancelling"   The  assessment run was canceled by the Can-
                   celReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

                 o "deleting"   The  assessment  run  was   deleted   by   the
                   DeleteReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

                 o "failed"  At least one individual assessment completed with
                   a failed status.

                 o "error-provisioning"  An internal error occurred while  re-
                   sources were provisioned (during provisioning status).

                 o "error-executing"   An  internal error occurred while indi-
                   vidual assessments ran (during running status).

                 o "invalid state"  The assessment run is in an unknown state.

                 o "passed"  All individual assessments  have  completed,  and
                   none has a failed status.

                 o "provisioning"   Resources  required  to run individual as-
                   sessments are being provisioned.

                 o "running"  Individual assessments are being run.

                 o "starting"  The assessment run is starting,  but  resources
                   are not yet being provisioned for individual assessments.

              ReplicationTaskAssessmentRunCreationDate -> (timestamp)
                 Date  on  which  the  assessment  run  was  created using the
                 StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation.

              AssessmentProgress -> (structure)
                 Indication of the completion progress for the individual  as-
                 sessments specified to run.

                 IndividualAssessmentCount -> (integer)
                     The  number  of individual assessments that are specified
                     to run.

                 IndividualAssessmentCompletedCount -> (integer)
                     The number of individual assessments that have completed,
                     successfully or not.

              LastFailureMessage -> (string)

                 ing the StartReplicationTaskAssessmentRun operation. The role
                 must allow the iam:PassRole action.

              ResultLocationBucket -> (string)
                 Amazon S3 bucket where DMS stores the results of this assess-
                 ment run.
