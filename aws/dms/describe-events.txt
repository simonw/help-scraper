DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  events  for  a  given source identifier and source type. You can
       also specify a start and end time. For more information on DMS  events,
       see  Working  with  Events  and Notifications in the Database Migration
       Service User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of an event source.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of DMS resource that generates events.

          Valid values: replication-instance | replication-task

          Possible values:

          o replication-instance

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time for the events to be listed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time for the events to be listed.

       --duration (integer)
          The duration of the events to be listed.

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for the source type that you've chosen.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          Filters  applied to events. The only valid filter is replication-in-
          stance-id .

          (structure)
              Identifies the name and value of a filter object. This filter is
              used  to  limit  the number and type of DMS objects that are re-
              turned for a particular Describe*  call  or  similar  operation.
              Filters are used as an optional parameter for certain API opera-
              tions.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter as specified for a Describe* or  simi-
                 lar operation.

              Values -> (list)
                 The  filter  value, which can specify one or more values used
                 to narrow the returned results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list DMS events

       The  following describe-events example lists the events that originated
       from a replication instance.

          aws dms describe-events \
              --source-type "replication-instance"

       Output:

          {
              "Events": [
                  {
                      "SourceIdentifier": "my-repl-instance",
                      "SourceType": "replication-instance",
                      "Message": "Replication application shutdown",
                      "EventCategories": [],
                      "Date": 1590771645.776
                  }
              ]
          }

       AWS Database Migration Service User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       Events -> (list)
          The events described.

          (structure)
              Describes  an  identifiable  significant activity that affects a
              replication instance or task. This object can provide  the  mes-
              sage, the available event categories, the date and source of the
              event, and the DMS resource type.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The identifier of an event source.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 The type of DMS resource that generates events.

                 Valid values:  replication-instance  |  endpoint  |  replica-
                 tion-task

              Message -> (string)
                 The event message.

              EventCategories -> (list)
                 The event categories available for the specified source type.

                 (string)

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date of the event.
