NAME
       describe-orderable-replication-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the replication instance types that can be
       created in the specified region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-orderable-replication-instances is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: OrderableReplicationInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-orderable-replication-instances
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrderableReplicationInstances -> (list)
          The order-able replication instances available.

          (structure)
              In response to the DescribeOrderableReplicationInstances  opera-
              tion,  this  object describes an available replication instance.
              This description includes the replication instance's  type,  en-
              gine version, and allocated storage.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the replication engine.

              ReplicationInstanceClass -> (string)
                 The  compute  and memory capacity of the replication instance
                 as defined for the specified replication instance class.  For
                 example  to specify the instance class dms.c4.large, set this
                 parameter to "dms.c4.large" .

                 For more information on the settings and capacities  for  the
                 available  replication  instance  classes,  see Selecting the
                 right DMS replication instance for your migration .

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The type of storage used by the replication instance.

              MinAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The minimum amount of storage (in gigabytes) that can be  al-
                 located for the replication instance.

              MaxAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  minimum amount of storage (in gigabytes) that can be al-
                 located for the replication instance.

              DefaultAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The default amount of storage (in gigabytes)  that  is  allo-
                 cated for the replication instance.

              IncludedAllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 The  amount  of  storage (in gigabytes) that is allocated for
                 the replication instance.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 List of Availability Zones for this replication instance.

                 (string)

              ReleaseStatus -> (string)
                 The value returned when the specified  EngineVersion  of  the
                 replication  instance is in Beta or test mode. This indicates
                 some features might not work as expected.

                 NOTE:
                     DMS supports  the  ReleaseStatus  parameter  in  versions
                     3.1.4 and later.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
