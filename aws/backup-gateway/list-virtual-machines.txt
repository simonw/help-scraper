LIST-VIRTUAL-MACHINES()                                LIST-VIRTUAL-MACHINES()



NAME
       list-virtual-machines -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your virtual machines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-virtual-machines  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: VirtualMachines

SYNOPSIS
            list-virtual-machines
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  next  item  following a partial list of returned resources. For
          example, if a request is made to return  maxResults  number  of  re-
          sources,  NextToken  allows  you  to  return more items in your list
          starting at the location pointed to by the next token.

       VirtualMachines -> (list)
          A list of your VirtualMachine objects, ordered by their  Amazon  Re-
          source Names (ARNs).

          (structure)
              A virtual machine that is on a hypervisor.

              HostName -> (string)
                 The host name of the virtual machine.

              HypervisorId -> (string)
                 The ID of the virtual machine's hypervisor.

              LastBackupDate -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date a virtual machine was backed up, in Unix
                 format and UTC time.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the virtual machine.

              Path -> (string)
                 The path of the virtual machine.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual machine.
