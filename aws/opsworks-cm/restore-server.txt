RESTORE-SERVER()                                              RESTORE-SERVER()



NAME
       restore-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a backup to a server that is in a CONNECTION_LOST , HEALTHY ,
       RUNNING , UNHEALTHY , or TERMINATED state. When you run  RestoreServer,
       the server's EC2 instance is deleted, and a new EC2 instance is config-
       ured. RestoreServer maintains the existing server endpoint, so configu-
       ration  management  of  the server's client devices (nodes) should con-
       tinue to work.

       Restoring from a backup is performed by creating a new EC2 instance. If
       restoration  is  successful,  and the server is in a HEALTHY state, AWS
       OpsWorks CM switches traffic over to the new instance.  After  restora-
       tion  is  finished,  the old EC2 instance is maintained in a Running or
       Stopped state, but is eventually terminated.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is not  in  a  valid
       state.  A  ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not
       exist. A ValidationException is raised when parameters of  the  request
       are not valid.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-server
          --backup-id <value>
          --server-name <value>
          [--instance-type <value>]
          [--key-pair <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The ID of the backup that you want to use to restore a server.

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server that you want to restore.

       --instance-type (string)
          The  type  of instance to restore. Valid values must be specified in
          the following format: ^([cm][34]|t2).* For example, m5.large . Valid
          values  are  m5.large  ,  r5.xlarge , and r5.2xlarge . If you do not
          specify this parameter, RestoreServer uses the  instance  type  from
          the specified backup.

       --key-pair (string)
          The name of the key pair to set on the new EC2 instance. This can be
          helpful if the administrator no longer has the SSH key.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To restore a server

       The following restore-server command performs an  in-place  restoration
       of a Chef Automate server named automate-06 in your default region from
       a backup with an ID of automate-06-2016-11-22T16:13:27.998Z.  Restoring
       a  server  restores  connections  to  the  nodes that the Chef Automate
       server was managing at the time that  the  specified  backup  was  per-
       formed.
          aws      opsworks-cm      restore-server      --backup-id     "auto-
          mate-06-2016-11-22T16:13:27.998Z" --server-name "automate-06"

       The output is the command ID only.  Output:

          (None)
