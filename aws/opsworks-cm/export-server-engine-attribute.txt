EXPORT-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTE()              EXPORT-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       export-server-engine-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports a specified server engine attribute as a base64-encoded string.
       For example, you can export user data that you can use in EC2 to  asso-
       ciate nodes with a server.

       This operation is synchronous.

       A  ValidationException is raised when parameters of the request are not
       valid. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server  does  not
       exist.  An InvalidStateException is thrown when the server is in any of
       the following states: CREATING, TERMINATED, FAILED or DELETING.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-server-engine-attribute
          --export-attribute-name <value>
          --server-name <value>
          [--input-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-attribute-name (string)
          The name of the export attribute. Currently,  the  supported  export
          attribute  is  Userdata  .  This exports a user data script that in-
          cludes parameters and values provided in the InputAttributes list.

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server from which you are exporting the attribute.

       --input-attributes (list)
          The list of engine attributes. The list type is EngineAttribute . An
          EngineAttribute  list item is a pair that includes an attribute name
          and its value. For the Userdata ExportAttributeName,  the  following
          are supported engine attribute names.

          o RunList  In  Chef,  a list of roles or recipes that are run in the
            specified order. In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

          o OrganizationName In Chef, an organization name. AWS  OpsWorks  for
            Chef Automate always creates the organization default . In Puppet,
            this parameter is ignored.

          o NodeEnvironment In Chef, a node environment (for example, develop-
            ment, staging, or one-box). In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

          o NodeClientVersion  In  Chef, the version of the Chef engine (three
            numbers separated by dots, such as 13.8.5). If this  attribute  is
            empty,  OpsWorks  for Chef Automate uses the most current version.
            In Puppet, this parameter is ignored.

          (structure)
              A name and value pair that is specific  to  the  engine  of  the
              server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the engine attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the engine attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EngineAttribute -> (structure)
          The requested engine attribute pair with attribute name and value.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the engine attribute.

          Value -> (string)
              The value of the engine attribute.

       ServerName -> (string)
          The server name used in the request.
