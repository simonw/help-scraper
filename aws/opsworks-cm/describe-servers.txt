DESCRIBE-SERVERS()                                          DESCRIBE-SERVERS()



NAME
       describe-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  configuration  management  servers that are identified with
       your account. Only the stored results  from  Amazon  DynamoDB  are  re-
       turned. AWS OpsWorks CM does not query other services.

       This operation is synchronous.

       A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when the server does not exist. A
       ValidationException is raised when parameters of the  request  are  not
       valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-servers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Servers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-servers
          [--server-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          Describes the server with the specified ServerName.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe servers

       The  following  describe-servers  command returns information about all
       servers that are associated with your account, and in your default  re-
       gion.:

          aws opsworks-cm describe-servers

       The  output for each server entry returned by the command resembles the
       following.  Output:

OUTPUT
       Servers -> (list)
          Contains the response to a DescribeServers request.
              For     Chef    Automate    servers:    If    DescribeServersRe-
              sponse$Servers$EngineAttributes     includes      CHEF_MAJOR_UP-
              GRADE_AVAILABLE,  you  can  upgrade  the Chef Automate server to
              Chef Automate 2. To be eligible for upgrade,  a  server  running
              Chef  Automate  1  must have had at least one successful mainte-
              nance run after November 1, 2019.

              For Puppet  servers:   DescribeServersResponse$Servers$EngineAt-
              tributes contains the following two responses:

          o PUPPET_API_CA_CERT  ,  the PEM-encoded CA certificate that is used
            by the Puppet API over TCP port number 8140. The CA certificate is
            also used to sign node certificates.

          o PUPPET_API_CRL  ,  a  certificate revocation list. The certificate
            revocation list is for internal  maintenance  purposes  only.  For
            more information about the Puppet certificate revocation list, see
            Man Page: puppet certificate_revocation_list in the  Puppet  docu-
            mentation.

                 using the Endpoint value if the  server  has  a  CustomDomain
                 specified.

              DisableAutomatedBackup -> (boolean)
                 Disables  automated  backups. The number of stored backups is

                 The  response  of a createServer() request returns the master
                 credential to access the server  in  EngineAttributes.  These
                 credentials  are  not stored by AWS OpsWorks CM; they are re-
                 turned only as part of the result of createServer().
                     Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

                 o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY : A  base64-encoded  RSA  private
                   key  that  is  generated by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate.
                   This private key is required to access the Chef API.

                 o CHEF_STARTER_KIT : A base64-encoded ZIP file. The ZIP  file
                   contains  a  Chef  starter  kit, which includes a README, a
