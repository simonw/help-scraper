START-MAINTENANCE()                                        START-MAINTENANCE()



NAME
       start-maintenance -

DESCRIPTION
       Manually  starts  server  maintenance. This command can be useful if an
       earlier maintenance attempt failed, and the underlying cause of mainte-
       nance  failure has been resolved. The server is in an UNDER_MAINTENANCE
       state while maintenance is in progress.

       Maintenance can only be started on servers  in  HEALTHY  and  UNHEALTHY
       states.  Otherwise,  an InvalidStateException is thrown. A ResourceNot-
       FoundException is thrown when the server  does  not  exist.  A  Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-maintenance
          --server-name <value>
          [--engine-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server on which to run maintenance.

       --engine-attributes (list)
          Engine  attributes that are specific to the server on which you want
          to run maintenance.
              Attributes accepted in a StartMaintenance request for Chef

          o CHEF_MAJOR_UPGRADE : If a Chef Automate server is eligible for up-
            grade  to  Chef  Automate 2, add this engine attribute to a Start-
            Maintenance request and set the  value  to  true  to  upgrade  the
            server  to  Chef  Automate 2. For more information, see Upgrade an
            AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate Server to Chef Automate 2 .

          (structure)
              A name and value pair that is specific  to  the  engine  of  the
              server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the engine attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the engine attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start maintenance

       The  following start-maintenance example manually starts maintenance on
       the specified Chef Automate or Puppet Enterprise server in your default
       region. This command is useful if an earlier, automated maintenance at-
       tempt failed, and the underlying cause of maintenance failure has  been
       resolved.

          aws opsworks-cm start-maintenance \
              --server-name 'automate-06'
