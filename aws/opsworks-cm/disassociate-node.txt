DISASSOCIATE-NODE()                                        DISASSOCIATE-NODE()



NAME
       disassociate-node -

DESCRIPTION
       Disassociates  a  node  from an AWS OpsWorks CM server, and removes the
       node from the server's managed nodes. After a  node  is  disassociated,
       the  node  key  pair is no longer valid for accessing the configuration
       manager's API. For more information about how to associate a node,  see
       AssociateNode .

       A node can can only be disassociated from a server that is in a HEALTHY
       state. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is  thrown.  A  ResourceNot-
       FoundException  is  thrown  when  the  server does not exist. A Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-node
          --server-name <value>
          --node-name <value>
          [--engine-attributes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server from which to disassociate the node.

       --node-name (string)
          The name of the client node.

       --engine-attributes (list)
          Engine attributes that are used for disassociating the node. No  at-
          tributes are required for Puppet.
              Attributes required in a DisassociateNode request for Chef

          o CHEF_ORGANIZATION  : The Chef organization with which the node was
            associated. By default only one organization named default can ex-
            ist.

          (structure)
              A  name  and  value  pair  that is specific to the engine of the
              server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the engine attribute.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the engine attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate nodes

       The following disassociate-node  command  disassociates  a  node  named
       i-44de882p, removing the node from management by a Chef Automate server
       named automate-06. Valid node names are EC2 instance IDs.:

          aws opsworks-cm disassociate-node --server-name "automate-06" --node-name "i-43de882p" --engine-attributes "Name=CHEF_ORGANIZATION,Value='MyOrganization' Name=CHEF_NODE_PUBLIC_KEY,Value='Public_key_contents'"

       The output returned by the command resembles the following.  Output:

          {
           "NodeAssociationStatusToken": "AHUY8wFe4pdXtZC5DiJa5SOLp5o14DH//rHRqHDWXxwVoNBxcEy4V7R0NOFymh7E/1HumOBPsemPQFE6dcGaiFk"
          }

       For more information, see Delete an  AWS  OpsWorks  for  Chef  Automate
       Server in the AWS OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       NodeAssociationStatusToken -> (string)
          Contains a token which can be passed to the DescribeNodeAssociation-
          Status API call to get the status of the disassociation request.
