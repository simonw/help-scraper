UPDATE-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTES()            UPDATE-SERVER-ENGINE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       update-server-engine-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  engine-specific  attributes  on a specified server. The server
       enters the MODIFYING state when this operation is in progress. Only one
       update  can  occur  at a time. You can use this command to reset a Chef
       server's public key (CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY )  or  a  Puppet  server's  admin
       password (PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD ).

       This operation is asynchronous.

       This  operation  can only be called for servers in HEALTHY or UNHEALTHY
       states. Otherwise, an InvalidStateException is raised.  A  ResourceNot-
       FoundException  is  thrown  when  the  server does not exist. A Valida-
       tionException is raised when parameters of the request are not valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-server-engine-attributes
          --server-name <value>
          --attribute-name <value>
          [--attribute-value <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server to update.

       --attribute-name (string)
          The name of the engine attribute to update.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The value to set for the attribute.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update server engine attributes

       The following update-server-engine-attributes command updates the value
       of  the  CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY  engine  attribute for a Chef Automate server
       named automate-06. It is currently not possible to change the value  of
       other engine attributes.

          aws opsworks-cm update-server-engine-attributes \
              --attribute-name CHEF_PIVOTAL_KEY \
              --attribute-value "new key value" \
              --server-name "automate-06"

       The output shows you information similar to the following about the up-
       dated server.

              dential  to access the server in EngineAttributes. These creden-
              tials are not stored by AWS OpsWorks CM; they are returned  only
              as part of the result of createServer().
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Chef

              o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY  :  A base64-encoded RSA private key
                that is generated by AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate. This pri-
                vate key is required to access the Chef API.

                contains a Chef starter kit, which includes a README,  a  con-
                figuration  file,  and the required RSA private key. Save this
                file, unzip it, and then change to the directory where  you've
                unzipped  the  file contents. From this directory, you can run
                Knife commands.
                 Attributes returned in a createServer response for Puppet

              o PUPPET_STARTER_KIT : A base64-encoded ZIP file. The  ZIP  file

                to the directory where you've unzipped the file contents.

              o PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD : An administrator password that you can
                use to sign in to the  Puppet  Enterprise  console  after  the
