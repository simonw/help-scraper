DELETE-SERVER()                                                DELETE-SERVER()



NAME
       delete-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  server  and the underlying AWS CloudFormation stacks (in-
       cluding the server's EC2 instance). When  you  run  this  command,  the
       server  state  is updated to DELETING . After the server is deleted, it
       is no longer returned by DescribeServer requests. If the AWS  CloudFor-
       mation stack cannot be deleted, the server cannot be deleted.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       An InvalidStateException is thrown when a server deletion is already in
       progress. A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when  the  server  does
       not  exist.  A ValidationException is raised when parameters of the re-
       quest are not valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-server
          --server-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --server-name (string)
          The ID of the server to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete servers

       The following delete-server command deletes  a  Chef  Automate  server,
       identified  by the server's name. After the server is deleted, it is no
       longer returned by DescribeServer requests.:

          aws opsworks-cm delete-server --server-name "automate-06"

       The output shows whether the server deletion succeeded.
