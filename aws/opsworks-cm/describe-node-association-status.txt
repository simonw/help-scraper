NAME
       describe-node-association-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the current status of an existing association or disassociation
       request.

       A ResourceNotFoundException is thrown when  no  recent  association  or
       disassociation  request  with the specified token is found, or when the
       server does not exist. A ValidationException is raised when  parameters
       of the request are not valid.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-node-association-status
          --node-association-status-token <value>
          --server-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --node-association-status-token (string)
          The token returned in either the AssociateNodeResponse or the Disas-
          sociateNodeResponse.

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server from which to disassociate the node.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe node association status

       The following describe-node-association-status command returns the sta-
       tus  of a request to associate a node with a Chef Automate server named
       automate-06.:

          aws opsworks-cm describe-node-association-status --server-name "automate-06" --node-association-status-token "AflJKl+/GoKLZJBdDQEx0O65CDi57blQe9nKM8joSok0pQ9xr8DqApBN9/1O6sLdSvlfDEKkEx+eoCHvjoWHaOs="

       The output for each account attribute entry returned by the command re-
       sembles the following.  Output:

          {
           "NodeAssociationStatus": "IN_PROGRESS"
          }

       More Information

       For  more  information,  see  DescribeNodeAssociationStatus  in the AWS
       OpsWorks for Chef Automate API Reference.

OUTPUT
       NodeAssociationStatus -> (string)
          The status of the association or disassociation request.
