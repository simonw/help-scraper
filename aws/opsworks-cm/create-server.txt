CREATE-SERVER()                                                CREATE-SERVER()



NAME
       create-server -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and immedately starts a new server. The server is ready to use
       when it is in the HEALTHY state. By default, you can create  a  maximum
       of 10 servers.

       This operation is asynchronous.

       A  LimitExceededException  is  thrown when you have created the maximum
       number of servers (10). A ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown when
       a  server  with  the  same  name  already  exists in the account. A Re-
       sourceNotFoundException is thrown when you specify a backup ID that  is
       not valid or is for a backup that does not exist. A ValidationException
       is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.

       If you do not specify a security group by adding  the  SecurityGroupIds
       parameter, AWS OpsWorks creates a new security group.
          Chef  Automate:  The default security group opens the Chef server to
          the world on TCP port 443. If a KeyName is present, AWS OpsWorks en-
          ables SSH access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP port 22.

          Puppet  Enterprise:  The  default security group opens TCP ports 22,
          443, 4433, 8140, 8142, 8143, and 8170. If a KeyName is present,  AWS
          OpsWorks  enables  SSH  access. SSH is also open to the world on TCP
          port 22.

       By default, your server is accessible from any IP address. We recommend
       that you update your security group rules to allow access from known IP
       addresses and address ranges only. To edit security group  rules,  open
       Security Groups in the navigation pane of the EC2 management console.

       To  specify  your  own  domain  for  a  server,  and  provide  your own
       self-signed or CA-signed certificate and private  key,  specify  values
       for CustomDomain , CustomCertificate , and CustomPrivateKey .

OPTIONS
       --associate-public-ip-address | --no-associate-public-ip-address (bool-
       ean)
          Associate a public IP address with a server that you are  launching.
          Valid values are true or false . The default value is true .

       --custom-domain (string)
          An optional public endpoint of a server, such as https://aws.my-com-
          pany.com . To access the server, create a CNAME DNS record  in  your
          preferred  DNS service that points the custom domain to the endpoint
          that is generated when the server is created (the value of the  Cre-
          ateServer Endpoint attribute). You cannot access the server by using
          the generated Endpoint value if the server is using a custom domain.
          If  you  specify  a  custom domain, you must also specify values for
          CustomCertificate and CustomPrivateKey .

       --custom-certificate (string)
          A PEM-formatted HTTPS certificate. The value can  be  be  a  single,
          self-signed  certificate,  or  a certificate chain. If you specify a
          custom certificate, you must also specify  values  for  CustomDomain
          and  CustomPrivateKey  . The following are requirements for the Cus-
          tomCertificate value:

          o You can provide either a self-signed, custom certificate,  or  the
            full certificate chain.

          o The certificate must be a valid X509 certificate, or a certificate
            chain in PEM format.

          o The certificate must be valid at the time of upload. A certificate
            can't be used before its validity period begins (the certificate's
            NotBefore date), or after it expires (the  certificate's  NotAfter
            date).

          o The  certificates common name or subject alternative names (SANs),
            if present, must match the value of CustomDomain .

          o The certificate must match the value of CustomPrivateKey .

       --custom-private-key (string)
          A private key in PEM format for connecting to the  server  by  using
          HTTPS. The private key must not be encrypted; it cannot be protected
          by a password or passphrase. If you specify a  custom  private  key,
          you  must also specify values for CustomDomain and CustomCertificate
          .

       --disable-automated-backup | --no-disable-automated-backup (boolean)
          Enable or disable scheduled backups. Valid values are true or  false
          . The default value is true .

       --engine (string)
          The  configuration  management  engine  to use. Valid values include
          ChefAutomate and Puppet .

       --engine-model (string)
          The engine model of the server. Valid values in this release include
          Monolithic for Puppet and Single for Chef.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  major release version of the engine that you want to use. For a
          Chef server, the valid value for EngineVersion is currently 2 .  For
          a Puppet server, valid values are 2019 or 2017 .

       --engine-attributes (list)
          Optional engine attributes on a specified server.
              Attributes accepted in a Chef createServer request:

          o CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY  :  A base64-encoded RSA public key. The
            corresponding private key is required to access the Chef API. When
            no  CHEF_AUTOMATE_PIVOTAL_KEY  is  set, a private key is generated
            and returned in the response.

          o CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD : The password for the administrative
            user in the Chef Automate web-based dashboard. The password length
            is a minimum of eight characters, and a maximum of 32.  The  pass-
            word  can  contain  letters,  numbers,  and  special characters (-
            !/@#$%^&+=_). The password must contain at least  one  lower  case
            letter, one upper case letter, one number, and one special charac-
            ter. When no CHEF_AUTOMATE_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set, one is generated
            and returned in the response.
              Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:

          o PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD  :  To  work with the Puppet Enterprise con-
            sole, a password must use ASCII characters.

          o PUPPET_R10K_REMOTE : The r10k remote is the URL  of  your  control
            repository                      (for                      example,
            ssh://git@your.git-repo.com:user/control-repo.git). Specifying  an
            r10k remote opens TCP port 8170.

          o PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY  :  If you are using a private Git reposi-
            tory, add PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY to specify a PEM-encoded private
            SSH key.

          (structure)
              A  name  and  value  pair  that is specific to the engine of the
              server.

            }
            ...
          ]

       --backup-retention-count (integer)
          The number of automated backups that you want to  keep.  Whenever  a
          new backup is created, AWS OpsWorks CM deletes the oldest backups if
          this number is exceeded. The default value is 1 .

       --server-name (string)
          The name of the server. The server name must be unique  within  your
          AWS account, within each region. Server names must start with a let-
          ter; then letters, numbers, or hyphens (-) are allowed, up to a max-
          imum of 40 characters.

       --instance-profile-arn (string)
          The  ARN of the instance profile that your Amazon EC2 instances use.
          Although the AWS OpsWorks console  typically  creates  the  instance
          profile for you, if you are using API commands instead, run the ser-
          vice-role-creation.yaml  AWS  CloudFormation  template,  located  at
          https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml.
          This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes  the  in-
          stance profile you need.

       --instance-type (string)
          The Amazon EC2 instance type to use. For example, m5.large .

       --key-pair (string)
          The  Amazon  EC2 key pair to set for the instance. This parameter is
          optional; if desired, you may specify this parameter to  connect  to
          your instances by using SSH.

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  start  time  for  a  one-hour period each week during which AWS
          OpsWorks CM performs maintenance on the instance. Valid values  must
          be  specified in the following format: DDD:HH:MM . MM must be speci-
          fied as 00 . The specified time is  in  coordinated  universal  time
          (UTC).  The  default  value  is a random one-hour period on Tuesday,
          Wednesday, or Friday. See TimeWindowDefinition for more information.
              Example:  Mon:08:00 , which represents a  start  time  of  every
              Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  start  time  for a one-hour period during which AWS OpsWorks CM
          backs up application-level data on your server if automated  backups
          are  enabled. Valid values must be specified in one of the following
          formats:

          o HH:MM for daily backups

          o DDD:HH:MM for weekly backups
              MM must be specified as 00 . The specified time  is  in  coordi-
              nated universal time (UTC). The default value is a random, daily
              start time.

              Example:  08:00 , which represents a daily start time  of  08:00
              UTC.

              Example:   Mon:08:00  ,  which  represents a start time of every
              Monday at 08:00 UTC. (8:00 a.m.)

       --security-group-ids (list)
          A list of security group IDs to attach to the Amazon  EC2  instance.
          If  you  add  this  parameter, the specified security groups must be
          within the VPC that is specified by SubnetIds .

          If you do not specify this parameter, AWS OpsWorks  CM  creates  one
          new security group that uses TCP ports 22 and 443, open to 0.0.0.0/0
          (everyone).

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The service role that the AWS OpsWorks CM service  backend  uses  to
          work with your account. Although the AWS OpsWorks management console
          typically creates the service role for you, if you are using the AWS
          CLI  or  API commands, run the service-role-creation.yaml AWS Cloud-
          Formation             template,              located              at
          https://s3.amazonaws.com/opsworks-cm-us-east-1-prod-default-assets/misc/opsworks-cm-roles.yaml.
          This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the  ser-
          vice role and instance profile that you need.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The IDs of subnets in which to launch the server EC2 instance.

          Amazon  EC2-Classic  customers:  This field is required. All servers
          must run within a VPC. The VPC must have "Auto Assign Public IP" en-
          abled.

          EC2-VPC  customers:  This  field  is optional. If you do not specify
          subnet IDs, your EC2 instances are created in a default subnet  that
          is  selected  by Amazon EC2. If you specify subnet IDs, the VPC must
          have "Auto Assign Public IP" enabled.

          ing the backup represented by BackupId.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a server

       The following create-server example creates a new Chef Automate  server
       named  automate-06  in your default region. Note that defaults are used
       for most other settings, such as number of backups to retain, and main-
       tenance and backup start times. Before you run a create-server command,
       complete prerequisites in Getting Started with AWS  OpsWorks  for  Chef
       Automate in the AWS Opsworks for Chef Automate User Guide.

          aws opsworks-cm create-server \
              --engine "Chef" \
              --engine-model "Single" \
              --engine-version "12" \
              --server-name "automate-06" \
              --instance-profile-arn "arn:aws:iam::1019881987024:instance-profile/aws-opsworks-cm-ec2-role" \
              --instance-type "t2.medium" \
              --key-pair "amazon-test" \
              --service-role-arn "arn:aws:iam::044726508045:role/aws-opsworks-cm-service-role"
