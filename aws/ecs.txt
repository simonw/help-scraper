DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Elastic  Container  Service  (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable,
       fast, container management service. It makes it easy to run, stop,  and
       manage  Docker  containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a
       serverless infrastructure that's managed by  Amazon  ECS  by  launching
       your  services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your
       tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute  Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)  in-
       stances that you manage.

       Amazon  ECS  makes  it easy to launch and stop container-based applica-
       tions with simple API calls. This makes it easy to  get  the  state  of
       your  cluster  from a centralized service, and gives you access to many
       familiar Amazon EC2 features.

       You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of  containers  across
       your  cluster  based  on  your  resource needs, isolation policies, and
       availability requirements. With Amazon ECS, you don't need  to  operate
       your  own  cluster management and configuration management systems. You
       also don't need to worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
