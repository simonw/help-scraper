NAME
       cloudcontrol -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  Amazon  Web  Services  Cloud  Control API to create, read, update,
       delete, and list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that belong  to  a  wide
       range  of  services--both Amazon Web Services and third-party. With the
       Cloud Control API standardized set of  application  programming  inter-
       faces  (APIs),  you  can perform CRUD-L operations on any supported re-
       sources in your Amazon Web Services account. Using Cloud  Control  API,
       you  won't have to generate code or scripts specific to each individual
       service responsible for those resources.

       For more information about Amazon Web Services Cloud Control  API,  see
       the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide .
