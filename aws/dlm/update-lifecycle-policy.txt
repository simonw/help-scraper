          policy type or the resource type.

          PolicyType -> (string)
              The valid target resource types and actions a policy can manage.
              Specify EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT to  create  a  lifecycle  policy
              that  manages the lifecycle of Amazon EBS snapshots. Specify IM-
              AGE_MANAGEMENT to create a lifecycle  policy  that  manages  the
              lifecycle of EBS-backed AMIs. Specify EVENT_BASED_POLICY to cre-
              ate an event-based policy that performs specific actions when  a
              defined event occurs in your Amazon Web Services account.

              The default is EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT .

          ResourceTypes -> (list)
              The  target  resource  type for snapshot and AMI lifecycle poli-
              cies. Use VOLUME to create snapshots of  individual  volumes  or
              use  INSTANCE  to create multi-volume snapshots from the volumes
              for an instance.

              This parameter is required for snapshot and AMI  policies  only.
              If you are creating an event-based policy, omit this parameter.

              (string)

          ResourceLocations -> (list)

                        policy.  To create snapshots in the same Region as the
                        source resource, specify CLOUD . To  create  snapshots
                        on  the  same  Outpost as the source resource, specify
                        OUTPOST_LOCAL . If you omit this parameter,  CLOUD  is
                        used by default.

                        If  the policy targets resources in an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices Region, then you must create  snapshots  in  the
                        same Region as the source resource.

                        If  the  policy  targets resources on an Outpost, then
                        you can create snapshots on the same  Outpost  as  the
                        source resource, or in the Region of that Outpost.

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  interval  between snapshots. The supported values

                     Interval -> (integer)
                        The  amount of time to retain each snapshot. The maxi-
                        mum is 100 years. This is equivalent to  1200  months,
                        5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                     IntervalUnit -> (string)

                        The Availability Zones in which to enable  fast  snap-
                        shot restore.

                        (string)

                 CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                     The rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                     You can only specify cross-Region copy rules for policies
                     that create snapshots in a Region. If the policy  creates
                     snapshots  on  an Outpost, then you cannot copy the snap-
                     shots to a Region or to an Outpost. If the policy creates
                     snapshots in a Region, then snapshots can be copied to up
                     to three Regions or Outposts.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                        TargetRegion -> (string)
                            Avoid using this parameter when creating new poli-
                            cies.  Instead, use Target to specify a target Re-
                            gion or a target Outpost for snapshot copies.

                            For policies created before the  Target  parameter
                            was  introduced, this parameter indicates the tar-
                            get Region for snapshot copies.

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region  or  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
                            (ARN)  of  the  target  Outpost  for  the snapshot
                            copies.

                            Use this parameter instead of  TargetRegion  .  Do
                            not specify both.

                        Encrypted -> (boolean)
                            To  encrypt  a  copy of an unencrypted snapshot if
                            encryption by default is not enabled,  enable  en-
                            cryption using this parameter. Copies of encrypted
                            snapshots are encrypted, even if this parameter is
                            false or if encryption by default is not enabled.

                        CmkArn -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the KMS key to
                            use for EBS encryption. If this parameter  is  not
                            specified,  the default KMS key for the account is
                            used.

                        CopyTags -> (boolean)
                            Indicates whether to copy  all  user-defined  tags
                            from the source snapshot to the cross-Region snap-
                            shot copy.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)

                            shot  copies are to be retained in the destination
                            Region.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The
                               maximum  is  100  years.  This is equivalent to
                               1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)

                               retention period, and it can't be greater  than
                               10 years. This is equivalent to 120 months, 520
                               weeks, or 3650 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)

                 DeprecateRule -> (structure)
                     The AMI deprecation rule for the schedule.

                     Count -> (integer)
                        If the schedule has a count-based retention rule, this
                        parameter specifies the number of oldest AMIs to  dep-
                        recate.  The  count  must be less than or equal to the

              NoReboot -> (boolean)
                 Applies to AMI lifecycle  policies  only.  Indicates  whether
                 targeted  instances  are  rebooted  when the lifecycle policy
                 runs. true indicates that targeted instances are not rebooted
                 when  the  policy runs. false indicates that target instances
                 are rebooted when the policy runs. The default is  true  (in-
                 stances are not rebooted).

          EventSource -> (structure)
              The event that triggers the event-based policy.

              This parameter is required for event-based policies only. If you
              are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this parameter.

              Type -> (string)
                 The source of the event. Currently  only  managed  CloudWatch
                 Events rules are supported.

              Parameters -> (structure)
                 Information about the event.

                 EventType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  event.  Currently,  only  snapshot sharing
                     events are supported.

                 SnapshotOwner -> (list)
                     The IDs of the Amazon  Web  Services  accounts  that  can
                     trigger  policy  by  sharing snapshots with your account.
                     The policy only runs if one of the specified  Amazon  Web
                     Services accounts shares a snapshot with your account.

                     (string)

                 DescriptionRegex -> (string)
                     The snapshot description that can trigger the policy. The
                     description pattern is specified using a regular  expres-
                     sion.  The policy runs only if a snapshot with a descrip-
                     tion that matches the specified pattern  is  shared  with
                     your account.

                     For  example,  specifying  ^.*Created  for  policy:  pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$ configures  the  policy  to  run
                     only    if    snapshots    created    by    policy   pol-
                     icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

          Actions -> (list)
              The actions to be performed when the event-based policy is trig-
              gered. You can specify only one action per policy.

              This parameter is required for event-based policies only. If you
              are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this parameter.

              (structure)
                 Specifies an action for an event-based policy.

                 Name -> (string)
                     A descriptive name for the action.

                 CrossRegionCopy -> (list)
                     The rule for copying shared snapshots across Regions.

                     (structure)
                        Specifies a rule for copying shared  snapshots  across
                        Regions.

                        Target -> (string)
                            The target Region.

                        EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings for the copied snapshot.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To  encrypt  a  copy of an unencrypted snapshot
                               when encryption by default is not enabled,  en-
                               able encryption using this parameter. Copies of
                               encrypted snapshots are encrypted, even if this
                               parameter  is  false  or when encryption by de-
                               fault is not enabled.

                            CmkArn -> (string)
                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  KMS  key
                               to use for EBS encryption. If this parameter is
                               not specified, the default KMS key for the  ac-
                               count is used.

                        RetainRule -> (structure)
                            Specifies  the  retention  rule  for  cross-Region
                            snapshot copies.

                            Interval -> (integer)
                               The amount of time to retain each snapshot. The
                               maximum  is  100  years.  This is equivalent to
                               1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                            IntervalUnit -> (string)
                               The unit of time for time-based retention.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
