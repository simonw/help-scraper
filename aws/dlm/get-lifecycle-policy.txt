NAME
       get-lifecycle-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets detailed information about the specified lifecycle policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-lifecycle-policy
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The identifier of the lifecycle policy.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The valid target resource types and actions a policy can man-
                 age.  Specify  EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT  to create a lifecycle
                 policy that manages the lifecycle of  Amazon  EBS  snapshots.
                 Specify  IMAGE_MANAGEMENT  to  create a lifecycle policy that
                 manages   the   lifecycle   of   EBS-backed   AMIs.   Specify
                 EVENT_BASED_POLICY  to create an event-based policy that per-
                 forms specific actions when a defined event  occurs  in  your
                 Amazon Web Services account.

                 The default is EBS_SNAPSHOT_MANAGEMENT .

              ResourceTypes -> (list)
                 The target resource type for snapshot and AMI lifecycle poli-
                 cies. Use VOLUME to create snapshots of individual volumes or

                 umes for an instance.

                 This parameter is required  for  snapshot  and  AMI  policies
                 only.  If  you  are creating an event-based policy, omit this

                 your account, specify OUTPOST .

                 If  you specify OUTPOST , Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager backs
                 up all resources of the specified type with  matching  target
                 tags across all of the Outposts in your account.

                 (string)

              TargetTags -> (list)
                 The  single  tag  that identifies targeted resources for this
                 policy.

                 This parameter is required  for  snapshot  and  AMI  policies
                 only.  If  you  are creating an event-based policy, omit this
                 parameter.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a tag for a resource.

                     Key -> (string)

                 lifecycle policies. A policy can have up to four schedulesone
                 mandatory schedule and up to three optional schedules.

                 This parameter is required  for  snapshot  and  AMI  policies
                 only.  If  you  are creating an event-based policy, omit this
                 parameter.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies a backup schedule for a snapshot or AMI lifecy-

                     TagsToAdd -> (list)
                        The tags to apply to policy-created  resources.  These
                        user-defined  tags  are  in addition to the Amazon Web
                        Services-added lifecycle tags.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a tag for a resource.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The tag key.

                        dynamically  when  the policy is executed. Keys may be
                        any valid Amazon EC2 tag key. Values must be in one of
                        the  two  following formats: $(instance-id) or $(time-
                        stamp) . Variable tags are only valid for EBS Snapshot
                        Management  Instance policies.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a tag for a resource.

                        Location -> (string)
                            Specifies the destination for snapshots created by
                            the policy. To create snapshots in the same Region
                            as  the source resource, specify CLOUD . To create
                            snapshots on the same Outpost as  the  source  re-
                            source,  specify  OUTPOST_LOCAL . If you omit this
                            parameter, CLOUD is used by default.

                            If the policy targets resources in an  Amazon  Web
                            Services Region, then you must create snapshots in
                            the same Region as the source resource.

                            If the policy targets  resources  on  an  Outpost,
                            then  you can create snapshots on the same Outpost
                            as the source resource, or in the Region  of  that
                            Outpost.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The interval between snapshots. The supported val-
                            ues are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The interval unit.

                        Times -> (list)
                            The time, in UTC, to start the operation. The sup-
                            ported format is hh:mm.

                            The operation occurs within a one-hour window fol-
                            lowing the specified time. If you do not specify a
                            time, Amazon DLM selects a time within the next 24
                            hours.

                            (string)

                        CronExpression -> (string)
                            The schedule, as a Cron expression.  The  schedule
                            interval  must  be  between 1 hour and 1 year. For
                            more information, see Cron expressions in the Ama-
                            zon CloudWatch User Guide .

                     RetainRule -> (structure)
                        The retention rule.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to retain for each volume,
                            up to a maximum of 1000.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The amount of time to retain  each  snapshot.  The
                            maximum  is  100 years. This is equivalent to 1200
                            months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The unit of time for time-based retention.

                     FastRestoreRule -> (structure)
                        The rule for enabling fast snapshot restore.

                        Count -> (integer)
                            The number of snapshots to be  enabled  with  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                        Interval -> (integer)
                            The  amount  of  time  to enable fast snapshot re-
                            store. The maximum is 100 years. This  is  equiva-
                            lent to 1200 months, 5200 weeks, or 36500 days.

                        IntervalUnit -> (string)
                            The  unit  of  time for enabling fast snapshot re-
                            store.

                        AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                            The Availability Zones in  which  to  enable  fast
                            snapshot restore.

                            (string)

                     CrossRegionCopyRules -> (list)
                        The rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                        You can only specify cross-Region copy rules for poli-
                        cies that create snapshots in a Region. If the  policy
                        creates  snapshots on an Outpost, then you cannot copy
                        the snapshots to a Region or to  an  Outpost.  If  the
                        policy  creates  snapshots in a Region, then snapshots
                        can be copied to up to three Regions or Outposts.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies a rule for cross-Region snapshot copies.

                            TargetRegion -> (string)
                               Avoid using this parameter  when  creating  new
                               policies. Instead, use Target to specify a tar-
                               get Region or a  target  Outpost  for  snapshot
                               copies.

                               For  policies created before the Target parame-
                               ter was introduced,  this  parameter  indicates
                               the target Region for snapshot copies.

                            Target -> (string)
                               The  target  Region or the Amazon Resource Name
                               (ARN) of the target Outpost  for  the  snapshot
                               copies.

                               Use this parameter instead of TargetRegion . Do
                               not specify both.

                            Encrypted -> (boolean)
                               To encrypt a copy of an unencrypted snapshot if

                     [EBS Snapshot Management  Instance policies  only]  Indi-
                     cates  whether  to exclude the root volume from snapshots
                     created using CreateSnapshots . The default is false.

                 NoReboot -> (boolean)
                     Applies to AMI lifecycle policies only. Indicates whether
                     targeted instances are rebooted when the lifecycle policy
                     runs. true indicates that targeted instances are not  re-
                     booted  when the policy runs. false indicates that target
                     instances are rebooted when the policy runs. The  default
                     is true (instances are not rebooted).

              EventSource -> (structure)
                 The event that triggers the event-based policy.

                 This  parameter is required for event-based policies only. If
                 you are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this  parame-
                 ter.

                        trigger policy by sharing snapshots with your account.
                        The  policy  only  runs if one of the specified Amazon
                        Web Services accounts shares a snapshot with your  ac-
                        count.

                        expression.  The policy runs only if a snapshot with a
                        description that  matches  the  specified  pattern  is
                        shared with your account.

                        icy-1234567890abcdef0.*$ configures the policy to  run
                        only    if    snapshots   created   by   policy   pol-
                        icy-1234567890abcdef0 are shared with your account.

              Actions -> (list)
                 The actions to be performed when the  event-based  policy  is
                 triggered. You can specify only one action per policy.

                 This  parameter is required for event-based policies only. If
                 you are creating a snapshot or AMI policy, omit this  parame-
                 ter.
