DESCRIBE-SERVICES()                                        DESCRIBE-SERVICES()



NAME
       describe-services -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the current list of Amazon Web Services services and a list of
       service categories for each service. You then  use  service  names  and
       categories  in your  CreateCase requests. Each Amazon Web Services ser-
       vice has its own set of categories.

       The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that  ap-
       pear  in the Service and Category lists on the Amazon Web Services Sup-
       port Center Create Case page. The values in those fields  don't  neces-
       sarily  match  the  service  codes  and  categories returned by the De-
       scribeServices operation. Always use the service codes  and  categories
       that  the DescribeServices operation returns, so that you have the most
       recent set of service and category codes.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-services
          [--service-code-list <value>]
          [--language <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-code-list (list)
          A JSON-formatted list of service codes available for Amazon Web Ser-
          vices services.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --language (string)
          The ISO 639-1 code for the language in  which  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  support.  Amazon  Web  Services Support currently supports
          English ("en") and Japanese  ("ja").  Language  parameters  must  be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
