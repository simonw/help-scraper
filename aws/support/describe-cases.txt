DESCRIBE-CASES()                                              DESCRIBE-CASES()



NAME
       describe-cases -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of cases that you specify by passing one or more case
       IDs. You can use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter  the
       cases  by date. You can set values for the includeResolvedCases and in-
       cludeCommunications parameters to specify how much information  to  re-
       turn.

       The response returns the following in JSON format:

       o One or more CaseDetails data types.

       o One or more nextToken values, which specify where to paginate the re-
         turned records represented by the CaseDetails objects.

       Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was cre-
       ated more than 12 months ago, a request might return an error.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       describe-cases is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: cases

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cases
          [--case-id-list <value>]
          [--display-id <value>]
          [--after-time <value>]
          [--before-time <value>]
          [--include-resolved-cases | --no-include-resolved-cases]
          [--language <value>]
          [--include-communications | --no-include-communications]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id-list (list)
          A  list  of  ID  numbers of the support cases you want returned. The
          maximum number of cases is 100.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --display-id (string)
          The ID displayed for a case in the Amazon Web Services Support  Cen-
          ter user interface.

       --after-time (string)
          The start date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --before-time (string)
          The  end  date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --include-resolved-cases | --no-include-resolved-cases (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  include  resolved  support  cases in the De-
          scribeCases response. By default, resolved cases aren't included.

       --language (string)
          The ISO 639-1 code for the language in  which  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  support.  Amazon  Web  Services Support currently supports
          English ("en") and Japanese  ("ja").  Language  parameters  must  be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --include-communications | --no-include-communications (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include communications in the DescribeCases re-
          sponse. By default, communications are included.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                               eration.
