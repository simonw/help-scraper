DESCRIBE-ATTACHMENT()                                    DESCRIBE-ATTACHMENT()



NAME
       describe-attachment -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can in-
       clude screenshots, error logs, or other files that describe your issue.
       Attachment IDs are generated by the case management system when you add
       an attachment to a case or case communication. Attachment IDs  are  re-
       turned  in the  AttachmentDetails objects that are returned by the  De-
       scribeCommunications operation.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-attachment
          --attachment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attachment-id (string)
          The  ID  of the attachment to return. Attachment IDs are returned by
          the  DescribeCommunications operation.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following describe-attachment example returns information about the
       attachment with the specified ID.

          aws support describe-attachment \

       Output:

              "attachment": {
                  "fileName": "troubleshoot-screenshot.png",
