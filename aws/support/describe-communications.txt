DESCRIBE-COMMUNICATIONS()                            DESCRIBE-COMMUNICATIONS()



NAME
       describe-communications -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  communications  and attachments for one or more support cases.
       Use the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter by date. You  can
       use the caseId parameter to restrict the results to a specific case.

       Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was cre-
       ated more than 12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.

       You can use the maxResults and nextToken parameters to control the pag-
       ination  of the results. Set maxResults to the number of cases that you
       want to display on each page, and use nextToken to specify the  resump-
       tion of pagination.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-communications is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: communications

SYNOPSIS
            describe-communications
          --case-id <value>
          [--before-time <value>]
          [--after-time <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --case-id (string)
          The  support  case ID requested or returned in the call. The case ID
          is an alphanumeric  string  formatted  as  shown  in  this  example:
          case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

       --before-time (string)
          The  end  date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --after-time (string)
          The start date for a filtered date search on support case communica-
          tions. Case communications are available for 12  months  after  cre-
          ation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the latest communication for a case

       The following describe-communications example returns the latest commu-
       nication for the specified support case in your AWS account.

          aws support describe-communications \
              --case-id "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47" \
              --after-time "2020-03-23T21:31:47.774Z" \
              --max-item 1

       Output:

          {
              "communications": [
                  {
                      "body": "I want to learn more about an AWS service.",
                      "attachmentSet": [],
                      "caseId": "case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47",
                      "timeCreated": "2020-05-12T23:12:35.000Z",
                      "submittedBy": "Amazon Web Services"
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "eyJuZXh0VG9rZW4iOiBudWxsLCAiYm90b190cnVuY2F0ZV9hbW91bnQEXAMPLE=="
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       communications -> (list)
          The communications for the case.

          (structure)
              A communication associated with a support case.  The  communica-
              tion  consists  of the case ID, the message body, attachment in-
              formation, the submitter of the communication, and the date  and
              time of the communication.

              caseId -> (string)
                 The  support  case  ID requested or returned in the call. The
                 case ID is an alphanumeric string formatted as shown in  this
                 example: case-12345678910-2013-c4c1d2bf33c5cf47

              body -> (string)
                 The text of the communication between the customer and Amazon
                 Web Services Support.

              submittedBy -> (string)
                 The identity of the account that submitted, or responded  to,
                 the  support  case.  Customer entries include the role or IAM
                 user as well as the email address.  For  example,  "AdminRole
                 (Role)  <janedoe@example.com>.  Entries  from  the Amazon Web
                 Services Support team  display  "Amazon  Web  Services,"  and
                 don't show an email address.

              timeCreated -> (string)
                 The time the communication was created.

              attachmentSet -> (list)
                 Information about the attachments to the case communication.

                     The  file name and ID of an attachment to a case communi-
                     cation. You can use the ID  to  retrieve  the  attachment
                     with the  DescribeAttachment operation.
