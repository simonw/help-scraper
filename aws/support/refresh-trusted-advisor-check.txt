NAME
       refresh-trusted-advisor-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Refreshes  the  Trusted  Advisor check that you specify using the check
       ID. You can get the check IDs by calling  the   DescribeTrustedAdvisor-
       Checks operation.

       NOTE:
          Some  checks  are  refreshed  automatically.  If  you  call  the Re-
          freshTrustedAdvisorCheck operation to refresh them,  you  might  see
          the InvalidParameterValue error.

       The response contains a  TrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatus object.

       NOTE:

          o You  must  have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If you call the Amazon Web Services Support API  from  an  account
            that  does  not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise
            Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message  ap-
            pears.  For  information  about  changing  your  support plan, see

SYNOPSIS
            refresh-trusted-advisor-check
          --check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --check-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the Trusted Advisor check to refresh.

          NOTE:
              Specifying the check ID of a check  that  is  automatically  re-
              freshed causes an InvalidParameterValue error.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
