NAME
       describe-trusted-advisor-checks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about all available Trusted Advisor checks, includ-
       ing the name, ID, category, description, and metadata. You must specify
       a language code. The Amazon Web Services Support API currently supports
       English ("en") and Japanese ("ja"). The response contains a  TrustedAd-
       visorCheckDescription  object  for  each check. You must set the Amazon
       Web Services Region to us-east-1.

       NOTE:

          o You must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or  Enterprise  Sup-
            port plan to use the Amazon Web Services Support API.

          o If  you  call  the Amazon Web Services Support API from an account
            that does not have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp,  or  Enterprise
            Support  plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message ap-
            pears. For information  about  changing  your  support  plan,  see
            Amazon Web Services Support .

          o The  names and descriptions for Trusted Advisor checks are subject
            to change. We recommend that you specify the check ID in your code
            to uniquely identify a check.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-trusted-advisor-checks
          --language <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --language (string)
          The  ISO  639-1  code  for the language in which Amazon Web Services
          provides support. Amazon Web  Services  Support  currently  supports
          English  ("en")  and  Japanese  ("ja").  Language parameters must be
          passed explicitly for operations that take them.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the available AWS Trusted Advisor checks

       that the output is shortened for readability.
