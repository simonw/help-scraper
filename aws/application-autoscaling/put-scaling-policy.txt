PUT-SCALING-POLICY()                                      PUT-SCALING-POLICY()



NAME
       put-scaling-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  scaling policy for an Application Auto Scaling
       scalable target.

       Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID,
       and scalable dimension. A scaling policy applies to the scalable target
       identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling  pol-
       icy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.

       Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same
       scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling poli-
       cies,  one  or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a
       chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the  scalable
       target  to  scale  out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling
       gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest  capacity  for
       both  scale  out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases ca-
       pacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and  the
       current  capacity  is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with
       the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30.

       We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling poli-
       cies  with  step scaling policies because conflicts between these poli-
       cies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the  step  scaling
       policy  initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy
       is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked.  After
       the  scale-in  activity completes, the target tracking policy could in-
       struct the scalable target to scale out again.

       For more information, see Target tracking  scaling  policies  and  Step
       scaling policies in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide .

       NOTE:
          If  a  scalable  target  is  deregistered, the scalable target is no
          longer available to execute scaling policies. Any  scaling  policies
          that were specified for the scalable target are deleted.

          The following policy types are supported:
              TargetTrackingScaling Not supported for Amazon EMR

              StepScaling  Not  supported  for  DynamoDB,  Amazon  Comprehend,

              Neptune.

          For  more information, see Target tracking scaling policies and Step
          scaling policies in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o StepScaling

          o TargetTrackingScaling

       --step-scaling-policy-configuration (structure)
          A step scaling policy.

          This parameter is required if you are creating a policy and the pol-
          icy type is StepScaling .

          AdjustmentType -> (string)
              Specifies how the ScalingAdjustment value in a StepAdjustment is
              interpreted (for example, an absolute number or  a  percentage).
              The valid values are ChangeInCapacity , ExactCapacity , and Per-
              centChangeInCapacity .
                 AdjustmentType is required if you are adding a new step scal-
                 ing policy configuration.

          StepAdjustments -> (list)
              A  set of adjustments that enable you to scale based on the size
              of the alarm breach.

              At least one step adjustment is required if you are adding a new
              step scaling policy configuration.

              (structure)
                 Represents       a       step      adjustment      for      a
                 StepScalingPolicyConfiguration  .  Describes  an   adjustment
                 based  on  the difference between the value of the aggregated
                 CloudWatch metric and the breach threshold  that  you've  de-
                 fined for the alarm.

                 For  the  following  examples, suppose that you have an alarm
                 with a breach threshold of 50:

                 o To trigger the adjustment when the metric is  greater  than
                   or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of 0
                   and an upper bound of 10.

                 o To trigger the adjustment when the metric is  greater  than
                   40  and  less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of
                   -10 and an upper bound of 0.

                 There are a few rules for the step adjustments for your  step
                 policy:

                 o The ranges of your step adjustments can't overlap or have a
                   gap.

                 o At most one step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If
                   one  step adjustment has a negative lower bound, then there
                   must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.

                 o At most one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If
                   one  step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there
                   must be a step adjustment with a null upper bound.

                 o The upper and lower bound can't be null in  the  same  step
                   adjustment.

                 MetricIntervalLowerBound -> (double)
                     The  lower  bound  for  the  difference between the alarm
                     threshold and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric  value
                     is  above the breach threshold, the lower bound is inclu-
                     sive (the metric must be greater than  or  equal  to  the
                     threshold  plus the lower bound). Otherwise, it is exclu-
                     sive (the metric must be greater than the threshold  plus
                     the  lower bound). A null value indicates negative infin-
                     ity.

                 MetricIntervalUpperBound -> (double)
                     The upper bound for  the  difference  between  the  alarm
                     threshold  and the CloudWatch metric. If the metric value
                     is above the breach threshold, the upper bound is  exclu-
                     sive (the metric must be less than the threshold plus the
                     upper bound). Otherwise, it is inclusive (the metric must
                     be  less  than  or  equal to the threshold plus the upper
                     bound). A null value indicates positive infinity.

                     The upper bound must be greater than the lower bound.

                 ScalingAdjustment -> (integer)
                     The amount by which to scale, based on the specified  ad-
                     justment  type.  A positive value adds to the current ca-
                     pacity while a negative number removes from  the  current
                     capacity. For exact capacity, you must specify a positive
                     value.

          MinAdjustmentMagnitude -> (integer)
              The minimum value to scale by when the adjustment type  is  Per-
              centChangeInCapacity  .  For  example, suppose that you create a
              step scaling policy to scale out an Amazon  ECS  service  by  25
              percent  and  you  specify a MinAdjustmentMagnitude of 2. If the
              service has 4 tasks and the scaling policy is performed, 25 per-
              cent  of 4 is 1. However, because you specified a MinAdjustment-
              Magnitude of 2, Application Auto Scaling scales out the  service
              by 2 tasks.

          Cooldown -> (integer)
              The  amount  of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scaling
              activity to take effect.

              With scale-out policies, the intention is to  continuously  (but
              not  excessively) scale out. After Application Auto Scaling suc-
              cessfully scales out using a step scaling policy, it  starts  to
              calculate  the  cooldown time. The scaling policy won't increase
              the desired capacity again unless either a larger scale  out  is
              triggered or the cooldown period ends. While the cooldown period
              is in effect, capacity added by the initiating scale-out  activ-
              ity  is  calculated as part of the desired capacity for the next
              scale-out activity. For example, when an alarm triggers  a  step
              scaling policy to increase the capacity by 2, the scaling activ-
              ity completes successfully, and a cooldown period starts. If the
              alarm  triggers  again  during the cooldown period but at a more
              aggressive step adjustment of 3, the previous increase of  2  is
              considered  part  of  the current capacity. Therefore, only 1 is
              added to the capacity.

              With scale-in policies, the intention is to scale  in  conserva-
              tively  to  protect  your applications availability, so scale-in
              activities are blocked until the cooldown  period  has  expired.
              However,  if  another alarm triggers a scale-out activity during
              the cooldown period after a scale-in activity, Application  Auto
              Scaling  scales  out  the  target immediately. In this case, the
              cooldown period for the scale-in activity stops and doesn't com-
              plete.

              Application  Auto  Scaling  provides  a default value of 600 for
              Amazon ElastiCache replication groups and a default value of 300
              for the following scalable targets:

              o AppStream 2.0 fleets

              o Aurora DB clusters

              o ECS services

              o SageMaker endpoint variants

              o Spot Fleets

              o Custom resources

              For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:

              o Amazon  Comprehend  document  classification and entity recog-
                nizer endpoints

              o DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes

       --target-tracking-scaling-policy-configuration (structure)
          A target tracking scaling policy. Includes support for predefined or
          customized metrics.

          This parameter is required if you are creating a policy and the pol-
          icy type is TargetTrackingScaling .

          TargetValue -> (double)
              The target value for the metric. Although this property  accepts
              numbers  of  type Double, it won't accept values that are either
              too small or too large. Values must be in the range of -2^360 to
              2^360.  The  value must be a valid number based on the choice of
              metric. For example, if the metric is CPU utilization, then  the
              target  value is a percent value that represents how much of the
              CPU can be used before scaling out.

          PredefinedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
              A predefined metric. You can specify either a predefined  metric
              or a customized metric.

              PredefinedMetricType -> (string)
                 The metric type. The ALBRequestCountPerTarget metric type ap-
                 plies only to Spot Fleet requests and ECS services.

              ResourceLabel -> (string)
                 Identifies the resource associated with the metric type.  You
                 can't  specify a resource label unless the metric type is AL-
                 BRequestCountPerTarget and there is a target  group  attached
                 to the Spot Fleet request or ECS service.

                 You  create the resource label by appending the final portion
                 of the load balancer ARN and the final portion of the  target
                 group  ARN  into a single value, separated by a forward slash
                 (/). The format of the resource label is:
                     app/my-alb/778d41231b141a0f/targetgroup/my-alb-tar-
                     get-group/943f017f100becff .

                 Where:

                 o app/<load-balancer-name>/<load-balancer-id>  is  the  final
                   portion of the load balancer ARN

                 o targetgroup/<target-group-name>/<target-group-id>  is   the
                   final portion of the target group ARN.

                 To  find  the  ARN  for an Application Load Balancer, use the
                 DescribeLoadBalancers API operation. To find the ARN for  the
                 target group, use the DescribeTargetGroups API operation.

          CustomizedMetricSpecification -> (structure)
              A  customized metric. You can specify either a predefined metric
              or a customized metric.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions of the metric.

                 Conditional: If you published your  metric  with  dimensions,
                 you must specify the same dimensions in your scaling policy.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the dimension names and values associated with
                     a metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension.

              Statistic -> (string)
                 The statistic of the metric.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the metric.

          ScaleOutCooldown -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, to wait for a previous scale-out
              activity to take effect.

              With the scale-out cooldown period , the intention is to contin-
              uously (but not excessively) scale out. After  Application  Auto
              Scaling  successfully scales out using a target tracking scaling
              policy, it starts to calculate the cooldown  time.  The  scaling
              policy won't increase the desired capacity again unless either a
              larger scale out is triggered or the cooldown period ends. While
              the cooldown period is in effect, the capacity added by the ini-
              tiating scale-out activity is calculated as part of the  desired
              capacity for the next scale-out activity.

              Application  Auto  Scaling  provides  a default value of 600 for
              Amazon ElastiCache replication groups and a default value of 300
              for the following scalable targets:

              o AppStream 2.0 fleets

              o Aurora DB clusters

              o ECS services

              o EMR clusters

              o Neptune clusters

              o SageMaker endpoint variants

              o Spot Fleets

              o Custom resources

              For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:

              o Amazon  Comprehend  document  classification and entity recog-
                nizer endpoints

              o DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes

              o Amazon Keyspaces tables

              o Lambda provisioned concurrency

              o Amazon MSK broker storage

          ScaleInCooldown -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, after a scale-in  activity  com-
              pletes before another scale-in activity can start.

              With the scale-in cooldown period , the intention is to scale in
              conservatively to protect  your  applications  availability,  so
              scale-in  activities  are  blocked until the cooldown period has
              expired. However, if another alarm triggers a scale-out activity
              during  the  scale-in  cooldown period, Application Auto Scaling
              scales out the target immediately. In this  case,  the  scale-in
              cooldown period stops and doesn't complete.

              Application  Auto  Scaling  provides  a default value of 600 for
              Amazon ElastiCache replication groups and a default value of 300
              for the following scalable targets:

              o AppStream 2.0 fleets

              o Aurora DB clusters

              o ECS services

              o EMR clusters

              o Neptune clusters

              o SageMaker endpoint variants

              o Spot Fleets

              o Custom resources

              For all other scalable targets, the default value is 0:

              o Amazon  Comprehend  document  classification and entity recog-
                nizer endpoints

              o DynamoDB tables and global secondary indexes

              o Amazon Keyspaces tables

              o Lambda provisioned concurrency

              o Amazon MSK broker storage

          DisableScaleIn -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether scale in by the target tracking scaling policy
              is disabled. If the value is true , scale in is disabled and the
              target tracking scaling policy won't remove  capacity  from  the
              scalable  target.  Otherwise, scale in is enabled and the target
              tracking scaling policy can remove capacity  from  the  scalable
              target. The default value is false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example  1: To apply a target tracking scaling policy with a predefined
       metric specification

       The following put-scaling-policy  example  applies  a  target  tracking
       scaling  policy with a predefined metric specification to an Amazon ECS
       service called web-app in the default cluster. The policy keeps the av-
       erage  CPU utilization of the service at 75 percent, with scale-out and
       scale-in cooldown periods of 60 seconds. The output contains  the  ARNs
       and names of the two CloudWatch alarms created on your behalf.

       Example 2: To apply a target tracking scaling policy with a  customized
       metric specification

       The  following  put-scaling-policy  example  applies  a target tracking
       scaling policy with a customized metric specification to an Amazon  ECS
       service called web-app in the default cluster. The policy keeps the av-
       erage utilization of the service at  75  percent,  with  scale-out  and
       scale-in  cooldown  periods of 60 seconds. The output contains the ARNs
       and names of the two CloudWatch alarms created on your behalf.

       Example 3: To apply a target tracking scaling policy for scale out only

       The  following  put-scaling-policy  example  applies  a target tracking
       scaling policy to an Amazon ECS service called web-app in  the  default
       cluster.  The  policy is used to scale out the ECS service when the Re-
       questCountPerTarget metric from the Application Load  Balancer  exceeds
       the  threshold.  The output contains the ARN and name of the CloudWatch
       alarm created on your behalf.
