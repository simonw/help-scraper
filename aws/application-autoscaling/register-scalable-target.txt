REGISTER-SCALABLE-TARGET()                          REGISTER-SCALABLE-TARGET()



NAME
       register-scalable-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers or updates a scalable target.

       A scalable target is a resource that Application Auto Scaling can scale
       out and scale in. Scalable targets are uniquely identified by the  com-
       bination of resource ID, scalable dimension, and namespace.

       When  you  register  a new scalable target, you must specify values for
       minimum and maximum capacity. Current capacity will be adjusted  within
       the specified range when scaling starts. Application Auto Scaling scal-
       ing policies will not scale capacity to values that are outside of this
       range.

       After  you  register  a scalable target, you do not need to register it
       again to use other Application Auto Scaling operations.  To  see  which
       resources  have  been registered, use DescribeScalableTargets . You can
       also view the  scaling  policies  for  a  service  namespace  by  using
       DescribeScalableTargets  . If you no longer need a scalable target, you
       can deregister it by using DeregisterScalableTarget .

       To update a scalable target, specify the parameters that  you  want  to
       change.  Include  the parameters that identify the scalable target: re-
       source ID, scalable dimension, and namespace. Any parameters  that  you
       don't specify are not changed by this update request.

       NOTE:
          If  you  call  the  RegisterScalableTarget API to update an existing
          scalable target, Application Auto Scaling retrieves the current  ca-
          pacity of the resource. If it is below the minimum capacity or above
          the maximum capacity, Application Auto Scaling adjusts the  capacity
          of  the scalable target to place it within these bounds, even if you
          don't include the MinCapacity or MaxCapacity request parameters.

       --min-capacity (integer)
          The  minimum value that you plan to scale in to. When a scaling pol-
          icy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale  in  (contract)
          as  needed to the minimum capacity limit in response to changing de-
          mand. This property is required when registering a new scalable tar-
          get.

          For certain resources, the minimum value allowed is 0. This includes
          Lambda provisioned concurrency, Spot Fleet, ECS services, Aurora  DB
          clusters,  EMR  clusters,  and  custom  resources. For all other re-
          sources, the minimum value allowed is 1.

       --max-capacity (integer)
          The maximum value that you plan to scale out to. When a scaling pol-
          icy is in effect, Application Auto Scaling can scale out (expand) as
          needed to the maximum capacity limit in response to changing demand.
          This property is required when registering a new scalable target.

          Although you can specify a large maximum capacity, note that service
          quotas may impose lower limits. Each service  has  its  own  default
          quotas  for  the  maximum  capacity  of the resource. If you want to
          specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For more infor-
          mation,  consult the documentation for that service. For information
          about the default quotas for each service, see Service Endpoints and
          Quotas in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .

       --role-arn (string)
          This  parameter  is  required  for services that do not support ser-
          vice-linked roles (such as Amazon EMR), and it must specify the  ARN
          of  an  IAM  role that allows Application Auto Scaling to modify the
          scalable target on your behalf.

          If the service supports service-linked roles, Application Auto Scal-
          ing  uses a service-linked role, which it creates if it does not yet
          exist. For more information, see Application Auto Scaling IAM  roles
          .

       --suspended-state (structure)
          An  embedded  object  that  contains attributes and attribute values
          that are used to suspend and resume automatic scaling.  Setting  the
          value of an attribute to true suspends the specified scaling activi-
          ties. Setting it to false (default) resumes  the  specified  scaling
          activities.
              Suspension Outcomes

          o For  DynamicScalingInSuspended  , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scale-in activities that are triggered by a scaling policy are
            suspended.

          o For  DynamicScalingOutSuspended , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scale-out activities that are triggered by  a  scaling  policy
            are suspended.

          o For  ScheduledScalingSuspended  , while a suspension is in effect,
            all scaling activities that involve  scheduled  actions  are  sus-
            pended.

          For more information, see Suspending and resuming scaling in the Ap-
          plication Auto Scaling User Guide .

          DynamicScalingInSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether scale in by a target tracking scaling policy or  a  step
              scaling  policy is suspended. Set the value to true if you don't
              want Application Auto Scaling to remove capacity when a  scaling
              policy is triggered. The default is false .

          DynamicScalingOutSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether  scale out by a target tracking scaling policy or a step
              scaling policy is suspended. Set the value to true if you  don't
              want  Application  Auto  Scaling  to add capacity when a scaling
              policy is triggered. The default is false .

          ScheduledScalingSuspended -> (boolean)
              Whether scheduled scaling is suspended. Set the value to true if
              you  don't want Application Auto Scaling to add or remove capac-
              ity by initiating scheduled actions. The default is false .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DynamicScalingInSuspended=boolean,DynamicScalingOutSuspended=boolean,ScheduledScalingSuspended=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DynamicScalingInSuspended": true|false,
            "DynamicScalingOutSuspended": true|false,
            "ScheduledScalingSuspended": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       Example 9: To register a new scalable target for Amazon Comprehend

       The  following  register-scalable-target  example registers the desired
       number of inference units to be used by the model for an Amazon Compre-
       hend document classifier endpoint using the endpoint's ARN, with a min-
       imum capacity of 1 inference unit and a maximum capacity of 3 inference
       units.  Each  inference  unit represents a throughput of 100 characters
       per second.

       Example 10: To register a new scalable target for AWS Lambda

       The following register-scalable-target  example  registers  the  provi-
       sioned  concurrency  for  an  alias called BLUE for the Lambda function
       called my-function, with a minimum capacity of 0 and a maximum capacity
       of 100.
