PUT-SCHEDULED-ACTION()                                  PUT-SCHEDULED-ACTION()



NAME
       put-scheduled-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates a scheduled action for an Application Auto Scaling
       scalable target.

       Each scalable target is identified by a service namespace, resource ID,
       and scalable dimension. A scheduled action applies to the scalable tar-
       get identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scheduled
       action until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.

       When  start and end times are specified with a recurring schedule using
       a cron expression or rates, they form the boundaries for when  the  re-
       curring action starts and stops.

       To  update  a scheduled action, specify the parameters that you want to
       change. If you don't specify start and end times, the  old  values  are
       deleted.

       For  more  information,  see  Scheduled scaling in the Application Auto
       Scaling User Guide .

       NOTE:
          If a scalable target is deregistered,  the  scalable  target  is  no
          longer  available  to  run  scheduled actions. Any scheduled actions
          that were specified for the scalable target are deleted.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-scheduled-action
          --service-namespace <value>
          [--schedule <value>]
          [--timezone <value>]
          --scheduled-action-name <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --scalable-dimension <value>
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--scalable-target-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-namespace (string)
          The namespace of the Amazon Web Services service that  provides  the
          resource.  For  a  resource provided by your own application or ser-
          vice, use custom-resource instead.

          Possible values:

          o ecs

          o elasticmapreduce

          o ec2

          o appstream

          o dynamodb

          o rds

          o sagemaker

          o custom-resource

          o comprehend

          o lambda

          o cassandra

          o kafka

          o elasticache

          o neptune

       --schedule (string)
          The schedule for this action. The following formats are supported:

          o At expressions - "at(*yyyy* -*mm* -*dd* T*hh* :*mm* :*ss* ) "

          o Rate expressions - "rate(*value*  *unit* ) "

          o Cron expressions - "cron(*fields* ) "

          At expressions are useful for one-time schedules.  Cron  expressions
          are  useful  for scheduled actions that run periodically at a speci-
          fied date and time, and rate expressions are  useful  for  scheduled
          actions that run at a regular interval.

          At  and cron expressions use Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) by de-
          fault.

          The cron format consists of six fields separated  by  white  spaces:
          [Minutes] [Hours] [Day_of_Month] [Month] [Day_of_Week] [Year].

          For rate expressions, value is a positive integer and unit is minute
          | minutes | hour | hours | day | days .

          For more information and examples, see Example scheduled actions for
          Application  Auto Scaling in the Application Auto Scaling User Guide
          .

       --timezone (string)
          Specifies the time zone used when setting a scheduled action by  us-
          ing an at or cron expression. If a time zone is not provided, UTC is
          used by default.

          Valid values are the canonical names of the  IANA  time  zones  sup-
          ported by Joda-Time (such as Etc/GMT+9 or Pacific/Tahiti ). For more
          information, see https://www.joda.org/joda-time/timezones.html .

       --scheduled-action-name (string)
          The name of the scheduled action. This name must be unique among all
          other scheduled actions on the specified scalable target.

       --resource-id (string)
          The identifier of the resource associated with the scheduled action.
          This string consists of the resource type and unique identifier.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The date and time for this scheduled action to start, in UTC.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The date and time for the recurring schedule to end, in UTC.

       --scalable-target-action (structure)
          The new minimum and maximum capacity. You can  set  both  values  or
          just  one.  At  the scheduled time, if the current capacity is below
          the minimum capacity, Application Auto Scaling  scales  out  to  the
          minimum  capacity.  If the current capacity is above the maximum ca-
          pacity, Application Auto Scaling scales in to the maximum capacity.

          MinCapacity -> (integer)
              The minimum capacity.

              For certain resources, the minimum value allowed is 0. This  in-
              cludes Lambda provisioned concurrency, Spot Fleet, ECS services,
              Aurora DB clusters, EMR clusters, and custom resources. For  all
              other resources, the minimum value allowed is 1.

          MaxCapacity -> (integer)
              The maximum capacity.

              Although  you  can  specify  a large maximum capacity, note that
              service quotas may impose lower limits. Each service has its own
              default  quotas for the maximum capacity of the resource. If you
              want to specify a higher limit, you can request an increase. For
              more  information,  consult  the documentation for that service.
              For information about the default quotas for each  service,  see
              Service  Endpoints and Quotas in the Amazon Web Services General
              Reference .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=integer,MaxCapacity=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinCapacity": integer,
            "MaxCapacity": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a scheduled action to a DynamoDB table

       This  example  adds a scheduled action to a DynamoDB table called Test-
       Table to scale out on a recurring schedule. On the  specified  schedule
       (every  day at 12:15pm UTC), if the current capacity is below the value
       specified for MinCapacity, Application Auto Scaling scales out  to  the
       value specified by MinCapacity.

       Command:

          aws application-autoscaling put-scheduled-action --service-namespace dynamodb --scheduled-action-name my-recurring-action --schedule "cron(15 12 * * ? *)" --resource-id table/TestTable --scalable-dimension dynamodb:table:WriteCapacityUnits --scalable-target-action MinCapacity=6

       For  more  information,  see  Scheduled Scaling in the Application Auto
       Scaling User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
