NAME
       rum -

DESCRIPTION
       With  Amazon  CloudWatch  RUM,  you can perform real-user monitoring to
       collect client-side data about your web  application  performance  from
       actual  user  sessions  in  real time. The data collected includes page
       load times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you  view  this
       data, you can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by
       the browsers and devices that your customers use.

       You  can  use  the  collected  data  to  quickly  identify  and   debug
       client-side  performance  issues.  CloudWatch  RUM  helps you visualize
       anomalies in your application performance and find  relevant  debugging
       data  such  as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions. You can
       also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact  including  the
       number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.
