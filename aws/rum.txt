NAME
       rum -

DESCRIPTION
       With  Amazon  CloudWatch  RUM,  you can perform real-user monitoring to
       collect client-side data about your web  application  performance  from
       actual  user  sessions  in  real time. The data collected includes page
       load times, client-side errors, and user behavior. When you  view  this
       data, you can see it all aggregated together and also see breakdowns by
       the browsers and devices that your customers use.
          <p>You can use the collected data  to  quickly  identify  and  debug
          client-side  performance  issues. CloudWatch RUM helps you visualize
          anomalies in your application performance and find  relevant  debug-
          ging  data  such as error messages, stack traces, and user sessions.
          You can also use RUM to understand the range of end-user impact  in-
          cluding the number of users, geolocations, and browsers used.</p>
