LIST-TEAM-MEMBERS()                                        LIST-TEAM-MEMBERS()



NAME
       list-team-members -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all team members associated with a project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-team-members  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: teamMembers

SYNOPSIS
            list-team-members
          --project-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-id (string)
          The ID of the project for which you want to list team members.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a list of team members

       The following list-team-members example retrieves a list of users asso-
       ciated with the specified project.

          aws codestar list-team-members \

                      "projectRole": "Owner",
                      "remoteAccessAllowed": false
                  },
                  {
                      "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
                      "projectRole": "Contributor",
                      "remoteAccessAllowed": false
                  }
              ]
          }

              remoteAccessAllowed -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the  user  is allowed to remotely access project re-
                 sources using an SSH public/private key pair.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The continuation token to use when requesting the next  set  of  re-
