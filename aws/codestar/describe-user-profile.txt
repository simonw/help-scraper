DESCRIBE-USER-PROFILE()                                DESCRIBE-USER-PROFILE()



NAME
       describe-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  a  user  in  AWS CodeStar and the user attributes across all
       projects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-user-profile
          --user-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view a user profile

       The following describe-user-profile example retrieves details about the
       user profile for the user with the specified ARN.

          aws codestar describe-user-profile \
              --user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern

       Output:

          {
              "userArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/intern",
              "displayName": "Intern",
              "emailAddress": "intern@example.com",
              "sshPublicKey": "intern",
              "createdTimestamp": 1572552308.607,
              "lastModifiedTimestamp": 1572553495.47
          }

OUTPUT
       userArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       displayName -> (string)
          The  display  name  shown for the user in AWS CodeStar projects. For
          example, this could be set to both first and last  name  ("Mary  Ma-
          jor")  or  a  single name ("Mary"). The display name is also used to
          generate the initial icon associated with the user in  AWS  CodeStar
          projects.  If  spaces  are  included  in the display name, the first
          character that appears after the space will be used  as  the  second
          character in the user initial icon. The initial icon displays a max-
          imum of two characters, so a display name with more than  one  space
          (for example "Mary Jane Major") would generate an initial icon using
          the first character and the first character after the  space  ("MJ",
          not "MM").

       emailAddress -> (string)
          The email address for the user. Optional.

       sshPublicKey -> (string)
          The  SSH public key associated with the user. This SSH public key is
          associated with the user profile, and can  be  used  in  conjunction
          with  the  associated  private  key for access to project resources,
          such as Amazon EC2 instances, if a project owner grants  remote  ac-
          cess to those resources.

       createdTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the user profile was created in AWS CodeStar,
          in timestamp format.

       lastModifiedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The date and time when the user profile was last modified, in  time-
          stamp format.
