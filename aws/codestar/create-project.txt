NAME
       create-project -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  project, including project resources. This action creates a
       project based on a submitted project request.  A  set  of  source  code
       files  and  a  toolchain template file can be included with the project
       request. If these are not provided, an empty project is created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The display name for the project to be created in AWS CodeStar.

       --id (string)
          The ID of the project to be created in AWS CodeStar.

       --description (string)
          The description of the project, if any.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A user- or system-generated token that identifies  the  entity  that
          requested project creation. This token can be used to repeat the re-
          quest.

       --source-code (list)
          A list of the Code objects submitted with the  project  request.  If
          this  parameter  is  specified,  the  request  must also include the
          toolchain parameter.

          (structure)
              Location and destination information about the source code files
              provided  with  the project request. The source code is uploaded

                 The location where the source code files  provided  with  the
                 project  request are stored. AWS CodeStar retrieves the files
                 during project creation.

                 s3 -> (structure)
                     Information about the Amazon S3 location where the source

                        The  Amazon S3 bucket name where the source code files

                        Name  of  the  GitHub  repository to be created in AWS

                        tory should be owned by a GitHub organization, provide
                        its name.

                     privateRepository -> (boolean)
                        Whether the GitHub  repository  is  to  be  a  private

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a project

       The following create-project example uses a JSON input file to create a
       CodeStar project.
