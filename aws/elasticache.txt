ELASTICACHE()                                                    ELASTICACHE()



NAME
       elasticache -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easier to set up, op-
       erate, and scale a distributed cache in the cloud.

       With ElastiCache, customers get all of the benefits of  a  high-perfor-
       mance,  in-memory cache with less of the administrative burden involved
       in launching and managing a distributed cache. The service makes setup,
       scaling,  and cluster failure handling much simpler than in a self-man-
       aged cache deployment.

       In addition, through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, customers  get
       enhanced visibility into the key performance statistics associated with
       their cache and can receive alarms if a part of their cache runs hot.
