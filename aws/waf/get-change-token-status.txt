DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the status of a ChangeToken that you got by calling  GetChange-
       Token . ChangeTokenStatus is one of the following values:

       o PROVISIONED  : You requested the change token by calling GetChangeTo-
         ken , but you haven't used it yet in a call  to  create,  update,  or
         delete an AWS WAF object.

       o PENDING  :  AWS  WAF is propagating the create, update, or delete re-
         quest to all AWS WAF servers.

       o INSYNC : Propagation is complete.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-change-token-status
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --change-token (string)
          The change token for which you want to get the status.  This  change
          token was previously returned in the GetChangeToken response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeTokenStatus -> (string)
          The status of the change token.
