DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Attaches an IAM policy to the specified resource.  The  only  supported
       use for this action is to share a RuleGroup across accounts.

       The PutPermissionPolicy is subject to the following restrictions:

       o You can attach only one policy with each PutPermissionPolicy request.

       o The policy must include an Effect , Action and Principal .

       o Effect must specify Allow .

       o The  Action in the policy must be waf:UpdateWebACL , waf-regional:Up-
         dateWebACL , waf:GetRuleGroup and waf-regional:GetRuleGroup . Any ex-
         tra or wildcard actions in the policy will be rejected.

       o The policy cannot include a Resource parameter.

       o The  ARN  in  the  request  must be a valid WAF RuleGroup ARN and the
         RuleGroup must exist in the same region.

       o The user making the request must be the owner of the RuleGroup.

       o Your policy must be composed using IAM Policy version 2012-10-17.

       For more information, see IAM Policies .

       An example of a valid policy parameter is shown in the Examples section

SYNOPSIS
            put-permission-policy
          --resource-arn <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the RuleGroup to which you want to
          attach the policy.

       --policy (string)
          The policy to attach to the specified RuleGroup.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
