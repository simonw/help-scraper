DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  RuleGroup that is specified by the  RuleGroupId  that  you
       included in the GetRuleGroup request.

       To view the rules in a rule group, use  ListActivatedRulesInRuleGroup .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule-group
          --rule-group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The  RuleGroupId of the  RuleGroup that you want to get. RuleGroupId
          is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRuleGroups .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RuleGroup -> (structure)
          Information  about the  RuleGroup that you specified in the GetRule-
          Group request.

          RuleGroupId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a RuleGroup . You use RuleGroupId to get
              more  information about a RuleGroup (see  GetRuleGroup ), update
              a RuleGroup (see  UpdateRuleGroup ), insert a RuleGroup  into  a
              WebACL  or  delete  a one from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or
              delete a RuleGroup from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRuleGroup ).
                 RuleGroupId is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRule-
                 Groups .

          Name -> (string)
              The  friendly  name or description for the RuleGroup . You can't
              change the name of a RuleGroup after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for the metrics  for  this  Rule-
              Group  . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z,
              a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum  length  one.  It
              can't  contain  whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF,
              including "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the  name
              of the metric after you create the RuleGroup .
