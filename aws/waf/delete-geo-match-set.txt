DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Permanently deletes a  GeoMatchSet . You can't delete a GeoMatchSet  if
       it's still used in any Rules or if it still includes any countries.

       If  you just want to remove a GeoMatchSet from a Rule , use  UpdateRule
       .

       To permanently delete a GeoMatchSet from AWS WAF, perform the following
       steps:

       o Update the GeoMatchSet to remove any countries. For more information,
         see  UpdateGeoMatchSet .

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a DeleteGeoMatchSet request.

       o Submit a DeleteGeoMatchSet request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-geo-match-set
          --geo-match-set-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --geo-match-set-id (string)
          The  GeoMatchSetID of the  GeoMatchSet that you want to delete. Geo-
          MatchSetId is returned by  CreateGeoMatchSet and  by   ListGeoMatch-
          Sets .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken  that  you used to submit the DeleteGeoMatchSet re-
          quest. You can also use this value to query the status  of  the  re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
