DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  Rule that is specified by the RuleId that you included  in
       the GetRule request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The  RuleId of the  Rule that you want to get. RuleId is returned by
          CreateRule and by  ListRules .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          Information  about  the   Rule that you specified in the GetRule re-
          quest. For more information, see the following topics:

          o Rule : Contains MetricName , Name , an array of Predicate objects,
            and RuleId

          o Predicate  : Each Predicate object contains DataId , Negated , and
            Type

          RuleId -> (string)
              A unique identifier for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more  in-
              formation  about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a Rule (see  Up-
              dateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one  from  a
              WebACL  (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRule ).
                 RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

          Name -> (string)
              The friendly name or description for the Rule . You can't change
              the name of a Rule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for the metrics for this Rule .
              The name can contain only  alphanumeric  characters  (A-Z,  a-z,
              0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't
              contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, includ-
              ing  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change MetricName af-
              ter you create the Rule .

          Predicates -> (list)
              The Predicates object contains one Predicate  element  for  each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a Rule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,   XssMatchSet  ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each  object,  indicates  whether you want to negate the set-
                 tings, for example, requests that do NOT originate  from  the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or  block  requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow,  block,  or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.
