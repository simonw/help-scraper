DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns an array of  SizeConstraintSetSummary objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-size-constraint-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: SizeConstraintSets

SYNOPSIS
            list-size-constraint-sets
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If you have more SizeConstraintSet objects than the number that  you
          specified  for  Limit  in  the  request,  the  response  includes  a
          NextMarker value. To list more SizeConstraintSet objects, submit an-
          other  ListSizeConstraintSets  request,  and  specify the NextMarker
          value from the response in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       SizeConstraintSets -> (list)
          An array of  SizeConstraintSetSummary objects.

                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              The Id and Name of a SizeConstraintSet .

              SizeConstraintSetId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for a SizeConstraintSet . You  use  Size-
                 ConstraintSetId  to get information about a SizeConstraintSet
                 (see  GetSizeConstraintSet ), update a SizeConstraintSet (see
                 UpdateSizeConstraintSet  ), insert a SizeConstraintSet into a
                 Rule or delete one from a Rule (see  UpdateRule ), and delete
                 a   SizeConstraintSet   from  AWS  WAF  (see   DeleteSizeCon-
                 straintSet ).
                     SizeConstraintSetId  is   returned   by    CreateSizeCon-
                     straintSet and by  ListSizeConstraintSets .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SizeConstraintSet , if any.
