NAME
       get-change-token -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       When you want to create, update, or  delete  AWS  WAF  objects,  get  a
       change  token  and  include  the change token in the create, update, or
       delete request. Change tokens ensure that your application doesn't sub-
       mit conflicting requests to AWS WAF.

       Each  create, update, or delete request must use a unique change token.
       If your application submits a GetChangeToken request and then submits a
       second  GetChangeToken  request  before submitting a create, update, or
       delete request, the second  GetChangeToken  request  returns  the  same
       value as the first GetChangeToken request.

       When you use a change token in a create, update, or delete request, the
       status of the change token changes to PENDING ,  which  indicates  that
       AWS  WAF  is  propagating  the  change  to  all  AWS  WAF  servers. Use
       GetChangeTokenStatus to determine the status of your change token.

SYNOPSIS
            get-change-token
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used in the request. Use this  value  in  a
          GetChangeTokenStatus  request  to  get the current status of the re-
          quest.
