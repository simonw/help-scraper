       list-activated-rules-in-rule-group is a paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: ActivatedRules

SYNOPSIS
            list-activated-rules-in-rule-group
          [--rule-group-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The  RuleGroupId  of the  RuleGroup for which you want to get a list
          of  ActivatedRule objects.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  you  have more ActivatedRules than the number that you specified
          for Limit in the request, the response includes a NextMarker  value.
          To  list  more ActivatedRules , submit another ListActivatedRulesIn-
          RuleGroup request, and specify the NextMarker  value  from  the  re-
          sponse in the NextMarker value in the next request.

       ActivatedRules -> (list)
          An array of ActivatedRules objects.

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This  is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and  see  the  AWS  WAF Developer Guide . With the latest
                     version, AWS WAF has a single set of  endpoints  for  re-
                     gional and global use.

              The ActivatedRule object in an  UpdateWebACL request specifies a
              Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule
              in  the  WebACL  ,  and the action that you want AWS WAF to take
              when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).

              To specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use  the  Action
              parameter in the  WebACLUpdate data type.

              Priority -> (integer)
                 Specifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evalu-
                 ated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated be-
                 fore  Rules  with  a higher value. The value must be a unique
                 integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL ,  the  values
                 don't need to be consecutive.

              RuleId -> (string)
                 The  RuleId  for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more informa-
                 tion about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a  Rule  (see   Up-
                 dateRule  ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from
                 a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS  WAF
                 (see  DeleteRule ).
                     RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

              Action -> (structure)
                 Specifies  the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a
                 web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values
                 for Action include the following:

                 o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                 o BLOCK  :  CloudFront  responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden)
                   status code.

                 o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match
                   the  conditions  in  the rule and then continues to inspect
                   the web request based on the remaining  rules  in  the  web
                   ACL.
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies  only when updating
                     or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you  do
                     not  use  ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update re-
                     quests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of Activate-
                     dRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     Specifies  how  you  want  AWS WAF to respond to requests
                     that match the settings in a Rule .  Valid  settings  in-
                     clude the following:

                     o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                     o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                     o COUNT  :  AWS  WAF increments a counter of the requests
                       that match all of the conditions in the rule.  AWS  WAF
                       then  continues to inspect the web request based on the
                       remaining rules in the web ACL. You can't specify COUNT
                       for the default action for a WebACL .

              OverrideAction -> (structure)
                 Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                 Any  rule  in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If
                 you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block
                 a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the
                 request and is configured to block that request.  However  if
                 you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction
                 to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block  action
                 specified by individual rules contained within the group. In-
                 stead of blocking matching requests, those requests  will  be
                 counted.  You  can  view  a  record of counted requests using
                 GetSampledRequests .
                     ActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only  when  updating
                     or  adding  a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do
                     not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other  update  re-
                     quests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of Activate-
                     dRule|OverrideAction .

                 Type -> (string)
                     COUNT overrides the action specified  by  the  individual
                     rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule's ac-
                     tion will take place.

              Type -> (string)
                 The rule type,  either  REGULAR  ,  as  defined  by   Rule  ,
                 RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as de-
                 fined by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR.  Although  this
                 field  is  optional,  be  aware  that  if  you  try  to add a
                 RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting  the  type,  the
                 UpdateWebACL  request  will fail because the request tries to
                 add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not  ex-
                 ist.

              ExcludedRules -> (list)
                 An  array  of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is ap-
                 plicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .

                 Sometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot  rule  groups  that
                 are  blocking  traffic  unexpectedly  (false  positives). One
                 troubleshooting technique is to identify  the  specific  rule
                 within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic
                 and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can  ex-
                 clude  rules  from  both your own rule groups and AWS Market-
                 place rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.

                 Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the
                 rule  group.  Rather,  it changes the action for the rules to
                 COUNT . Therefore, requests that match  an  ExcludedRule  are
                 counted  but  not  blocked.  The RuleGroup owner will receive
                 COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                 If you want to exclude rules from a rule group  that  is  al-
                 ready associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:

                 o Use  the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that
                   you want to exclude. For more information about  the  logs,
                   see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                 o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                   o The first action deletes the existing rule group from the
                     web ACL. That is, in the  UpdateWebACL request, the first
                     Updates:Action  should  be  DELETE  and Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId should be the rule group that  contains  the
                     rules that you want to exclude.

                   o The  second  action  inserts the same rule group back in,
                     but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the  second
                     Updates:Action   should  be  INSERT  ,  Updates:Activate-
                     dRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you  just  re-
                     moved,  and  ExcludedRules  should contain the rules that
                     you want to exclude.

                            For  the  latest  version of AWS WAF , use the AWS
                            WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF  Developer  Guide  .

                            of endpoints for regional and global use.

                     The rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable
                     only  when  the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup . The
                     rule must belong to the RuleGroup that  is  specified  by
                     the ActivatedRule .

                     RuleId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the
                        rule group.
