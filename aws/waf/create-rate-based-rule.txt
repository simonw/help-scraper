NAME
       create-rate-based-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a  RateBasedRule . The RateBasedRule  contains  a  RateLimit  ,
       which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from
       a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule  also
       contains  the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates
       that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these re-
       quests exceed the RateLimit .

       If  you  add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule , a request not
       only must exceed the RateLimit , but it also must match all the  condi-
       tions  to  be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the fol-
       lowing to a RateBasedRule :

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to
       block  requests  that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to
       be blocked, it must  come  from  the  IP  address  192.0.2.44  and  the
       User-Agent  header  in the request must contain the value BadBot . Fur-
       ther, requests that match these two conditions must be  received  at  a
       rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions
       are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests.  If  the
       rate  drops  below  1,000  for  a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer
       blocks the requests.

       As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular
       page  on  your site. To do this, you could add the following to a Rate-
       BasedRule :

       o A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI

       o A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH

       o A TargetString of login

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       By adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL , you could limit requests  to
       your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

       To create and configure a RateBasedRule , perform the following steps:

       o Create  and  update  the  predicates  that you want to include in the
         rule. For more information, see  CreateByteMatchSet ,  CreateIPSet  ,
         and  CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRule request.

       o Submit a CreateRateBasedRule request.

       o Use GetChangeToken to get the change token that you  provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRule request.

       o Submit  an UpdateRateBasedRule request to specify the predicates that
         you want to include in the rule.

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the RateBasedRule . For more
         information, see  CreateWebACL .

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A friendly name or description of the   RateBasedRule  .  You  can't
          change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

       --metric-name (string)
          A  friendly  name  or description for the metrics for this RateBase-
          dRule . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z,
          0-9),  with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can't con-
          tain whitespace or metric names  reserved  for  AWS  WAF,  including
          "All"  and "Default_Action." You can't change the name of the metric
          after you create the RateBasedRule .

       --rate-key (string)
          The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are likely  ar-
          riving from a single source and thus subject to rate monitoring. The
          only valid value for RateKey is IP . IP indicates that requests that
          arrive from the same IP address are subject to the RateLimit that is
          specified in the RateBasedRule .

          Possible values:

          o IP

       --rate-limit (long)
          The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the
          field  that  is  specified by RateKey , allowed in a five-minute pe-
          riod. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and the  other
          predicates  specified in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the
          action that is specified for this rule.

       --change-token (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateRateBasedRule  re-
          quest.  You  can  also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .

       --tags (list)
          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              A tag associated with an AWS resource. Tags are key:value  pairs
              that  you  can  use to categorize and manage your resources, for
              purposes like billing. For example, you might set the tag key to
              "customer"  and  the  value  to the customer name or ID. You can
              specify one or more tags to add to each AWS resource, up  to  50
              tags for a resource.

              Tagging  is  only  available through the API, SDKs, and CLI. You
              can't manage or view tags through the AWS WAF  Classic  console.
              You  can  tag  the AWS resources that you manage through AWS WAF
              Classic: web ACLs, rule groups, and rules.

              Key -> (string)

              Value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       Rule -> (structure)
          The  RateBasedRule that is returned in the  CreateRateBasedRule  re-
          sponse.

          RuleId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for a RateBasedRule . You use RuleId to get
              more information about a RateBasedRule (see  GetRateBasedRule ),
              update  a  RateBasedRule  (see   UpdateRateBasedRule ), insert a
              RateBasedRule into a WebACL or delete one  from  a  WebACL  (see
              UpdateWebACL  ),  or  delete  a  RateBasedRule from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRateBasedRule ).

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description for a RateBasedRule .  You  can't
              change the name of a RateBasedRule after you create it.

          MetricName -> (string)
              A  friendly  name or description for the metrics for a RateBase-
              dRule . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters  (A-Z,
              a-z,  0-9),  with  maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It
              can't contain whitespace or metric names reserved for  AWS  WAF,
              including  "All" and "Default_Action." You can't change the name
              of the metric after you create the RateBasedRule .

          MatchPredicates -> (list)
              The Predicates object contains one Predicate  element  for  each
              ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet , or  SqlInjectionMatchSet object that you
              want to include in a RateBasedRule .

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies the  ByteMatchSet ,  IPSet ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet
                 ,   XssMatchSet  ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet , and  Size-
                 ConstraintSet objects that you want to add to a Rule and, for
                 each  object,  indicates  whether you want to negate the set-
                 tings, for example, requests that do NOT originate  from  the
                 IP address 192.0.2.44.

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or  block  requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow,  block,  or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

          RateKey -> (string)
              The field that AWS WAF uses to determine if requests are  likely
              arriving from single source and thus subject to rate monitoring.
              The only valid value for RateKey is IP . IP indicates  that  re-
              quests  arriving  from  the  same  IP address are subject to the
              RateLimit that is specified in the RateBasedRule .

          RateLimit -> (long)
              The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in
              the  field  specified  by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute
              period. If the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and  the
              other  predicates  specified  in  the rule are also met, AWS WAF
              triggers the action that is specified for this rule.

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateRateBasedRule  re-
          quest.  You  can  also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
