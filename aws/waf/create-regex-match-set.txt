NAME
       create-regex-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Creates a  RegexMatchSet . You then use  UpdateRegexMatchSet  to  iden-
       tify  the  part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such
       as the values of the User-Agent header or the query string.  For  exam-
       ple,  you  can  create  a RegexMatchSet that contains a RegexMatchTuple
       that looks for any requests with User-Agent headers that match a Regex-
       PatternSet  with  pattern B[a@]dB[o0]t . You can then configure AWS WAF
       to reject those requests.

       To create and configure a RegexMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a CreateRegexMatchSet request.

       o Submit a CreateRegexMatchSet request.

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateRegexMatchSet request.

       o Submit an  UpdateRegexMatchSet request to specify the part of the re-
         quest  that  you  want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or
         the URI) and the value, using a RegexPatternSet , that you  want  AWS
         WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A friendly name or description of the   RegexMatchSet  .  You  can't
          change Name after you create a RegexMatchSet .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RegexMatchSet -> (structure)
          A  RegexMatchSet that contains no RegexMatchTuple objects.

          RegexMatchSetId -> (string)
              The  RegexMatchSetId  for  a RegexMatchSet . You use RegexMatch-
              SetId to get information about a RegexMatchSet  (see   GetRegex-
              MatchSet  ), update a RegexMatchSet (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ),
              insert a RegexMatchSet into a Rule or delete  one  from  a  Rule
              (see  UpdateRule ), and delete a RegexMatchSet from AWS WAF (see
              DeleteRegexMatchSet ).
                 RegexMatchSetId is returned by   CreateRegexMatchSet  and  by
                 ListRegexMatchSets .

          Name -> (string)
              A friendly name or description of the  RegexMatchSet . You can't
              change Name after you create a RegexMatchSet .

          RegexMatchTuples -> (list)
              Contains an array of  RegexMatchTuple objects. Each  RegexMatch-
              Tuple object contains:

              o The  part  of  a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect,
                such as a query string or the value of the User-Agent header.

              o The identifier of the pattern (a regular expression) that  you
                want AWS WAF to look for. For more information, see  RegexPat-
                ternSet .

              o Whether to perform any conversions on  the  request,  such  as
                converting it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the spec-
                ified string.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 The regular expression pattern  that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
                 search for in web requests, the location in requests that you
                 want AWS WAF to search, and other settings. Each  RegexMatch-
                 Tuple object contains:

                 o The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect,
                   such as a query string  or  the  value  of  the  User-Agent
                   header.

                 o The  identifier  of the pattern (a regular expression) that
                   you want AWS WAF to look for.  For  more  information,  see
                   RegexPatternSet .

                 o Whether  to perform any conversions on the request, such as
                   converting it to lowercase, before inspecting  it  for  the
                   specified string.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies  where  in a web request to look for the Regex-
                     PatternSet .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation on RegexPatternSet before
                     inspecting a request for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an op-
                     erating system commandline command and using unusual for-
                     matting to disguise some or all of the command, use  this
                     option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use  this option to replace the following characters with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use  this  option to replace HTML-encoded characters with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces  (ampersand)nbsp;  with  a non-breaking space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces characters that  are  represented  in  decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use this option to convert  uppercase  letters  (A-Z)  to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

                 RegexPatternSetId -> (string)
                     The RegexPatternSetId for a  RegexPatternSet  .  You  use
                     RegexPatternSetId  to  get  information about a RegexPat-
                     ternSet (see  GetRegexPatternSet ),  update  a  RegexPat-
                     ternSet (see  UpdateRegexPatternSet ), insert a RegexPat-
                     ternSet into a RegexMatchSet or delete one from a  Regex-
                     MatchSet  (see  UpdateRegexMatchSet ), and delete an Reg-
                     exPatternSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteRegexPatternSet ).
                        RegexPatternSetId  is  returned  by    CreateRegexPat-
                        ternSet and by  ListRegexPatternSets .

       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateRegexMatchSet re-
          quest. You can also use this value to query the status  of  the  re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
