NAME
       update-rate-based-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  Predicate objects in a rule and updates  the  Rate-
       Limit in the rule.

       Each  Predicate  object identifies a predicate, such as a  ByteMatchSet
       or an  IPSet , that specifies the web requests that you want  to  block
       or  count.  The  RateLimit  specifies the number of requests every five
       minutes that triggers the rule.

       If you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule , a request  must
       match  all  the  predicates  and  exceed the RateLimit to be counted or
       blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a  RateBasedRule
       :

       o An IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32

       o A ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       You then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to
       block requests that satisfy the rule. For a request to be  blocked,  it
       must  come  from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in
       the request must contain the value  BadBot  .  Further,  requests  that
       match  these  two  conditions  much  be received at a rate of more than
       1,000 every five minutes. If the rate drops below this limit,  AWS  WAF
       no longer blocks the requests.

       As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular
       page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to  a  Rate-
       BasedRule :

       o A ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI

       o A PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH

       o A TargetString of login

       Further, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.

       By  adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL , you could limit requests to
       your login page without affecting the rest of your site.

       --updates (list)
          An  array  of  RuleUpdate  objects  that  you want to insert into or
          delete from a  RateBasedRule .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              Specifies a Predicate (such as an IPSet ) and indicates  whether
              you want to add it to a Rule or delete it from a Rule .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify  INSERT  to add a Predicate to a Rule . Use DELETE to
                 remove a Predicate from a Rule .

              Predicate -> (structure)
                 The ID of the Predicate (such as an IPSet ) that you want  to
                 add to a Rule .

                 Negated -> (boolean)
                     Set Negated to False if you want AWS WAF to allow, block,
                     or count requests based on the settings in the  specified
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow or  block  requests
                     based on that IP address.

                     Set Negated to True if you want AWS WAF to allow or block
                     a request based on the negation of the  settings  in  the
                     ByteMatchSet  ,   IPSet  ,   SqlInjectionMatchSet ,  Xss-
                     MatchSet ,  RegexMatchSet ,  GeoMatchSet ,  or   SizeCon-
                     straintSet . For example, if an IPSet includes the IP ad-
                     dress 192.0.2.44 , AWS WAF will allow,  block,  or  count
                     requests based on all IP addresses except  192.0.2.44 .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  predicate in a Rule , such as ByteMatch or
                     IPSet .

                 DataId -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for a predicate in a Rule ,  such  as
                     ByteMatchSetId  or  IPSetId  .  The ID is returned by the
                     corresponding Create or List command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Action=string,Predicate={Negated=boolean,Type=string,DataId=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Action": "INSERT"|"DELETE",
              "Predicate": {
                "Negated": true|false,
                "Type": "IPMatch"|"ByteMatch"|"SqlInjectionMatch"|"GeoMatch"|"SizeConstraint"|"XssMatch"|"RegexMatch",
                "DataId": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --rate-limit (long)
          The maximum number of requests, which have an identical value in the
          field specified by the RateKey , allowed in a five-minute period. If
          the number of requests exceeds the RateLimit and  the  other  predi-
          cates  specified  in the rule are also met, AWS WAF triggers the ac-
          tion that is specified for this rule.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the UpdateRateBasedRule  re-
          quest.  You  can  also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
