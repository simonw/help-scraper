NAME
       update-byte-match-set -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  ByteMatchTuple objects (filters) in a  ByteMatchSet
       . For each ByteMatchTuple object, you specify the following values:

       o Whether to insert or delete the object from the array. If you want to
         change a ByteMatchSetUpdate object, you delete  the  existing  object
         and add a new one.

       o The part of a web request that you want AWS WAF to inspect, such as a
         query string or the value of the User-Agent header.

       o The bytes (typically a string that corresponds with ASCII characters)
         that  you  want  AWS WAF to look for. For more information, including
         how you specify the values for the AWS WAF API and  the  AWS  CLI  or
         SDKs, see TargetString in the  ByteMatchTuple data type.

       o Where to look, such as at the beginning or the end of a query string.

       o Whether to perform any conversions on the request, such as converting
         it to lowercase, before inspecting it for the specified string.

       For example, you can add a ByteMatchSetUpdate object that  matches  web
       requests  in  which  User-Agent headers contain the string BadBot . You
       can then configure AWS WAF to block those requests.

       To create and configure a ByteMatchSet , perform the following steps:

       o Create a ByteMatchSet. For more information, see   CreateByteMatchSet
         .

       o Use   GetChangeToken  to get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateByteMatchSet request.

       o Submit an UpdateByteMatchSet request to specify the part of  the  re-
         quest  that  you  want AWS WAF to inspect (for example, the header or
         the URI) and the value that you want AWS WAF to watch for.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

          (structure)

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              In an  UpdateByteMatchSet request, ByteMatchSetUpdate  specifies
              whether  to  insert or delete a  ByteMatchTuple and includes the
              settings for the ByteMatchTuple .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to insert or delete a  ByteMatchTuple .

              ByteMatchTuple -> (structure)
                 Information about the part of a web request that you want AWS
                 WAF  to inspect and the value that you want AWS WAF to search
                 for. If you specify DELETE for the  value  of  Action  ,  the
                 ByteMatchTuple  values  must  exactly match the values in the
                 ByteMatchTuple that you want to delete from the  ByteMatchSet
                 .

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     The  part  of  a  web  request  that  you want AWS WAF to
                     search, such as a specified header or a query string. For
                     more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  part  of the web request that you want AWS WAF to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER  :  A  specified request header, for example,
                          the value of the User-Agent or  Referer  header.  If
                          you  choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated  the  type
                          of  operation  that the request is asking the origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods:  DELETE  ,  GET  , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part  of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI  :  The  part of a web request that identifies a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as the HTTP request body, such as data from a  form.
                          The  request  body  immediately  follows the request
                          headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of  the
                          request  body  are  forwarded to AWS WAF for inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of  the  body, you can create a size constraint set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that  you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS  :  Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but
                          rather than inspecting a single parameter,  AWS  WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value or regex pattern that you specify  in  Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When  the  value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of
                        the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for  exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for example, UserName or SalesRegion .  The  parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TargetString -> (blob)
                     The  value  that  you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF
                     searches for the specified string in the part of web  re-
                     quests  that  you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum
                     length of the value is 50 bytes.

                     Valid values depend on the values that you specified  for
                     FieldToMatch :

                     o HEADER  : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for
                       in the request header that  you  specified  in   Field-
                       ToMatch  ,  for example, the value of the User-Agent or
                       Referer header.

                     o METHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the  type  of
                       operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports
                       the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS  ,
                       PATCH , POST , and PUT .

                     o QUERY_STRING  :  The  value  that  you  want AWS WAF to
                       search for in the query string, which is the part of  a
                       URL that appears after a ? character.

                     o URI  : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in
                       the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for exam-
                       ple, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     o BODY  :  The  part of a request that contains any addi-
                       tional data that you want to send to your web server as
                       the  HTTP  request  body, such as data from a form. The
                       request body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                       Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body
                       are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection.  To  allow  or
                       block requests based on the length of the body, you can
                       create a size constraint set. For more information, see
                       CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                     o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  :  The  parameter in the query string
                       that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRegion
                       . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 charac-
                       ters.

                     o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but  in-
                       stead  of  inspecting  a  single parameter, AWS WAF in-
                       spects all parameters within the query string  for  the
                       value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString
                       .

                     If TargetString includes alphabetic  characters  A-Z  and
                     a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                        If you're using the AWS WAF API

                     Specify  a base64-encoded version of the value. The maxi-
                     mum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50
                     bytes.

                     For  example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the
                     value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to  search  the
                     User-Agent  header  for the value BadBot , you base64-en-
                     code BadBot using MIME base64-encoding  and  include  the
                     resulting  value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString
                     .
                        If you're using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs

                     The value that you want AWS WAF to search  for.  The  SDK
                     automatically base64 encodes the value.

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text  transformations  eliminate some of the unusual for-
                     matting that attackers use in web requests in  an  effort
                     to  bypass  AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS
                     WAF performs the transformation  on  FieldToMatch  before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an op-
                     erating system command line  command  and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.

                 PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                     Within  the  portion  of  a  web request that you want to
                     search (for example, in the query string, if any),  spec-
                     ify  where  you  want AWS WAF to search. Valid values in-
                     clude the following:
                        CONTAINS

                     The specified part of the web request  must  include  the
                     value of TargetString , but the location doesn't matter.
                        CONTAINS_WORD

                     The  specified  part  of the web request must include the
                     value of TargetString ,  and  TargetString  must  contain
                     only  alphanumeric  characters  or  underscore (A-Z, a-z,
                     0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString  must  be  a  word,
                     which means one of the following:

                     o TargetString exactly matches the value of the specified
                       part of the web request, such as the value of a header.

                     o TargetString is at the beginning of the specified  part
                       of the web request and is followed by a character other
                       than an alphanumeric character or underscore  (_),  for
                       example, BadBot; .

                     o TargetString is at the end of the specified part of the
                       web request and is preceded by a character  other  than
                       an  alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for exam-
                       ple, ;BadBot .

                     o TargetString is in the middle of the specified part  of
                       the web request and is preceded and followed by charac-
                       ters other than alphanumeric characters  or  underscore
                       (_), for example, -BadBot; .
                        EXACTLY

                     The  value  of the specified part of the web request must
                     exactly match the value of TargetString .
                        STARTS_WITH

                     The value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of
                     the specified part of the web request.
                        ENDS_WITH

                     The  value  of TargetString must appear at the end of the
                     specified part of the web request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a byte match set

       The following update-byte-match-set command  deletes  a  ByteMatchTuple
       object (filter) in a ByteMatchSet:

          aws waf update-byte-match-set --byte-match-set-id a123fae4-b567-8e90-1234-5ab67ac8ca90 --change-token 12cs345-67cd-890b-1cd2-c3a4567d89f1 --updates Action="DELETE",ByteMatchTuple={FieldToMatch={Type="HEADER",Data="referer"},TargetString="badrefer1",TextTransformation="NONE",PositionalConstraint="CONTAINS"}

       For  more  information, see Working with String Match Conditions in the
       AWS WAF developer guide.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The ChangeToken that you used to submit the  UpdateByteMatchSet  re-
          quest.  You  can  also use this value to query the status of the re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
