DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Associates a  LoggingConfiguration with a specified web ACL.

       You can access information about all traffic that AWS WAF inspects  us-
       ing the following steps:

       o Create  an  Amazon  Kinesis  Data Firehose.  Create the data firehose
         with a PUT source and in the region that you are operating.  However,
         if  you  are  capturing logs for Amazon CloudFront, always create the
         firehose in US East (N. Virginia).

       NOTE:
          Do not create the data firehose  using  a  Kinesis  stream  as  your
          source.

       o Associate  that firehose to your web ACL using a PutLoggingConfigura-
         tion request.

       When you successfully enable logging  using  a  PutLoggingConfiguration
       request,  AWS  WAF will create a service linked role with the necessary
       permissions to write logs to the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. For more
       information, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information in the AWS WAF De-
       veloper Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-logging-configuration
          --logging-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --logging-configuration (structure)
          The Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose that contains the inspected traffic
          information,  the  redacted  fields details, and the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) of the web ACL to monitor.

          NOTE:
              When specifying Type in RedactedFields , you must use one of the
              following values: URI , QUERY_STRING , HEADER , or METHOD .

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want to
              associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              An array of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ARNs.

              (string)

          RedactedFields -> (list)
              The parts of the request that you want redacted from  the  logs.
              For example, if you redact the cookie field, the cookie field in
              the firehose will be xxx .

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies where in a web request to look for TargetString .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The part of the web request that  you  want  AWS  WAF  to
                     search  for  a  specified string. Parts of a request that
                     you can search include the following:

                     o HEADER : A specified request header, for  example,  the
                       value  of  the  User-Agent  or  Referer  header. If you
                       choose HEADER for the type, specify  the  name  of  the
                       header in Data .

                     o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type of
                       operation that the request is asking the origin to per-
                       form. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods:
                       DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and  PUT
                       .

                     o QUERY_STRING  :  A query string, which is the part of a
                       URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                     o URI : The part of a web request that identifies  a  re-
                       source, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     o BODY  :  The  part of a request that contains any addi-
                       tional data that you want to send to your web server as
                       the  HTTP  request  body, such as data from a form. The
                       request body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                       Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body
                       are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection.  To  allow  or
                       block requests based on the length of the body, you can
                       create a size constraint set. For more information, see
                       CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                     o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  :  The  parameter in the query string
                       that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRegion
                       . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 charac-
                       ters.

                     o ALL_QUERY_ARGS :  Similar  to  SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                       rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will
                       inspect all parameters within the query for  the  value
                       or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .

                 Data -> (string)
                     When  the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the
                     header that you want AWS  WAF  to  search,  for  example,
                     User-Agent  or  Referer  .  The name of the header is not
                     case sensitive.

                     When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  enter  the
                     name  of  the  parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                     for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name
                     is not case sensitive.

                     If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceArn=string,LogDestinationConfigs=string,string,RedactedFields=[{Type=string,Data=string},{Type=string,Data=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ResourceArn": "string",
            "LogDestinationConfigs": ["string", ...],
            "RedactedFields": [
              {
                "Type": "URI"|"QUERY_STRING"|"HEADER"|"METHOD"|"BODY"|"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG"|"ALL_QUERY_ARGS",
                "Data": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To  create  a logging configuration for the web ACL ARN with the speci-
       fied Kinesis Firehose stream ARN

       The following put-logging-configuration example displays  logging  con-
       figuration for WAF with CloudFront.

          aws waf put-logging-configuration \
              --logging-configuration ResourceArn=arn:aws:waf::123456789012:webacl/3bffd3ed-fa2e-445e-869f-a6a7cf153fd3,LogDestinationConfigs=arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789012:deliverystream/aws-waf-logs-firehose-stream,RedactedFields=[]

       Output:

          {
              "LoggingConfiguration": {
                  "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:waf::123456789012:webacl/3bffd3ed-fa2e-445e-869f-a6a7cf153fd3",
                  "LogDestinationConfigs": [
                      "arn:aws:firehose:us-east-1:123456789012:deliverystream/aws-waf-logs-firehose-stream"
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  LoggingConfiguration that you submitted in the request.

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want to
              associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              An array of Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ARNs.

              (string)

          RedactedFields -> (list)
              The parts of the request that you want redacted from  the  logs.
              For example, if you redact the cookie field, the cookie field in
              the firehose will be xxx .
