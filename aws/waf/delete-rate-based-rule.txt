DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Permanently deletes a  RateBasedRule . You can't delete a rule if  it's
       still  used  in  any  WebACL objects or if it still includes any predi-
       cates, such as ByteMatchSet objects.

       If you just want to remove a rule from a WebACL , use  UpdateWebACL .

       To permanently delete a RateBasedRule from AWS WAF, perform the follow-
       ing steps:

       o Update  the  RateBasedRule to remove predicates, if any. For more in-
         formation, see  UpdateRateBasedRule .

       o Use  GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide  in  the
         ChangeToken parameter of a DeleteRateBasedRule request.

       o Submit a DeleteRateBasedRule request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-rate-based-rule
          --rule-id <value>
          --change-token <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rule-id (string)
          The  RuleId of the  RateBasedRule that you want to delete. RuleId is
          returned by  CreateRateBasedRule and by  ListRateBasedRules .

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeToken -> (string)
          The  ChangeToken that you used to submit the DeleteRateBasedRule re-
          quest. You can also use this value to query the status  of  the  re-
          quest. For more information, see  GetChangeTokenStatus .
