       update-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Inserts or deletes  ActivatedRule objects in a RuleGroup .

       You can only insert REGULAR rules into a rule group.

       You can have a maximum of ten rules per rule group.

       To create and configure a RuleGroup , perform the following steps:

       o Create and update the Rules that you want to include in the RuleGroup
         . See  CreateRule .

       o Use  GetChangeToken  to  get the change token that you provide in the
         ChangeToken parameter of an  UpdateRuleGroup request.

       o Submit an UpdateRuleGroup request to add Rules to the RuleGroup .

       o Create and update a WebACL that contains the RuleGroup  .  See   Cre-
         ateWebACL .

       If  you  want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing
       one and add the new one.

       For more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block
       HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --rule-group-id (string)
          The  RuleGroupId  of  the   RuleGroup that you want to update. Rule-
          GroupId is returned by  CreateRuleGroup and by  ListRuleGroups .

       --updates (list)
          An array of RuleGroupUpdate objects that you want to insert into  or
          delete from a  RuleGroup .

          You can only insert REGULAR rules into a rule group.
              ActivatedRule|OverrideAction   applies  only  when  updating  or
              adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use Ac-
              tivatedRule|Action  .  For  all other update requests, Activate-
              dRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

              NOTE:
                 This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  information,
                 see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                     For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API
                     and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide  .  With  the  latest
                     version,  AWS  WAF  has a single set of endpoints for re-
                     gional and global use.

              Specifies an ActivatedRule and indicates whether you want to add
              it to a RuleGroup or delete it from a RuleGroup .

              Action -> (string)
                 Specify  INSERT  to add an ActivatedRule to a RuleGroup . Use
                 DELETE to remove an ActivatedRule from a RuleGroup .

              ActivatedRule -> (structure)
                 The ActivatedRule object specifies a Rule that  you  want  to
                 insert  or  delete,  the priority of the Rule in the WebACL ,
                 and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a  web  re-
                 quest matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  order  in which the Rules in a WebACL are
                     evaluated. Rules with a  lower  value  for  Priority  are
                     evaluated  before  Rules  with  a higher value. The value
                     must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to  a
                     WebACL , the values don't need to be consecutive.

                 RuleId -> (string)
                     The RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more infor-
                     mation about a Rule (see  GetRule ), update a  Rule  (see
                     UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one
                     from a WebACL (see  UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from
                     AWS WAF (see  DeleteRule ).
                        RuleId is returned by  CreateRule and by  ListRules .

                 Action -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  action  that  CloudFront or AWS WAF takes
                     when a web request matches the conditions in the  Rule  .
                     Valid values for Action include the following:

                     o ALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.

                     o BLOCK  :  CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbid-
                       den) status code.

                     o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of  requests  that
                       match  the conditions in the rule and then continues to
                       inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in
                       the web ACL.
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this  case,
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies  how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests
                        that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings in-
                        clude the following:

                        o ALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests

                        o BLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests

                        o COUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests
                          that match all of the conditions in  the  rule.  AWS
                          WAF  then continues to inspect the web request based
                          on the remaining rules in the  web  ACL.  You  can't
                          specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .

                 OverrideAction -> (structure)
                     Use the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .

                     Any  rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request.
                     If you set the OverrideAction to  None  ,  the  RuleGroup
                     will  block a request if any individual rule in the Rule-
                     Group matches the request and is configured to block that
                     request.  However if you first want to test the RuleGroup
                     , set the OverrideAction to Count .  The  RuleGroup  will
                     then  override  any  block action specified by individual
                     rules contained within the  group.  Instead  of  blocking
                     matching  requests,  those  requests will be counted. You
                     can view a record of counted requests  using   GetSample-
                     dRequests .
                        ActivatedRule|OverrideAction  applies only when updat-
                        ing or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In  this  case
                        you  do  not  use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other
                        update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used  instead
                        of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .

                     Type -> (string)
                        COUNT overrides the action specified by the individual
                        rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the  rule's
                        action will take place.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  rule  type,  either  REGULAR , as defined by  Rule ,
                     RATE_BASED , as defined by  RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as
                     defined  by  RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although
                     this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a
                     RATE_BASED  rule  to  a web ACL without setting the type,
                     the  UpdateWebACL request will fail because  the  request
                     tries  to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which
                     does not exist.

                 ExcludedRules -> (list)
                     An array of rules to exclude from a rule group.  This  is
                     applicable  only when the ActivatedRule refers to a Rule-
                     Group .

                     Sometimes it is necessary  to  troubleshoot  rule  groups
                     that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives).
                     One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific
                     rule  within  the rule group that is blocking the legiti-
                     mate traffic and then disable (exclude)  that  particular
                     rule.  You  can  exclude  rules  from  both your own rule
                     groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been as-
                     sociated with a web ACL.

                     Specifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from
                     the rule group. Rather, it changes  the  action  for  the
                     rules  to  COUNT  . Therefore, requests that match an Ex-
                     cludedRule are counted but  not  blocked.  The  RuleGroup
                     owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .

                     If  you  want  to exclude rules from a rule group that is
                     already associated with a web ACL, perform the  following
                     steps:

                     o Use  the  AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules
                       that you want to exclude. For  more  information  about
                       the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .

                     o Submit an  UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:

                       o The first action deletes the existing rule group from
                         the web ACL. That is, in the   UpdateWebACL  request,
                         the  first  Updates:Action  should  be DELETE and Up-
                         dates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the  rule  group
                         that contains the rules that you want to exclude.

                       o The  second  action  inserts the same rule group back
                         in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the
                         second  Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:Ac-
                         tivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that  you
                         just  removed,  and  ExcludedRules should contain the
                         rules that you want to exclude.

                        The  rule to exclude from a rule group. This is appli-
                        cable only when the ActivatedRule refers  to  a  Rule-
                        Group  . The rule must belong to the RuleGroup that is
                        specified by the ActivatedRule .

                        RuleId -> (string)
                            The unique identifier for the rule to exclude from
                            the rule group.

       --change-token (string)
          The value returned by the most recent call to  GetChangeToken .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
