DESCRIPTION
       NOTE:
          This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS
          WAF Classic in the developer guide.
              For the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS  WAFV2  API  and
              see  the  AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS
              WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.

       Returns the  SizeConstraintSet specified by SizeConstraintSetId .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-size-constraint-set
          --size-constraint-set-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --size-constraint-set-id (string)
          The SizeConstraintSetId of the  SizeConstraintSet that you  want  to
          get. SizeConstraintSetId is returned by  CreateSizeConstraintSet and
          by  ListSizeConstraintSets .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SizeConstraintSet -> (structure)
          Information about the  SizeConstraintSet that you specified  in  the
          GetSizeConstraintSet  request. For more information, see the follow-
          ing topics:

          o SizeConstraintSet : Contains SizeConstraintSetId , SizeConstraints
            , and Name

          o SizeConstraints  :  Contains  an array of  SizeConstraint objects.
            Each SizeConstraint object contains  FieldToMatch ,  TextTransfor-
            mation , ComparisonOperator , and Size

          o FieldToMatch : Contains Data and Type

          SizeConstraintSetId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier for a SizeConstraintSet . You use SizeCon-
              straintSetId to get information about a  SizeConstraintSet  (see
              GetSizeConstraintSet ), update a SizeConstraintSet (see  Update-
              SizeConstraintSet ), insert a SizeConstraintSet into a  Rule  or
              delete one from a Rule (see  UpdateRule ), and delete a SizeCon-
              straintSet from AWS WAF (see  DeleteSizeConstraintSet ).
                 SizeConstraintSetId is returned  by   CreateSizeConstraintSet
                 and by  ListSizeConstraintSets .

          Name -> (string)
              The name, if any, of the SizeConstraintSet .

          SizeConstraints -> (list)
              Specifies the parts of web requests that you want to inspect the
              size of.

              (structure)

                 NOTE:
                     This is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more  informa-
                     tion, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.
                        For  the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2
                        API and see the AWS WAF Developer  Guide  .  With  the
                        latest  version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints
                        for regional and global use.

                 Specifies a constraint on the size of a part of the  web  re-
                 quest.  AWS  WAF  uses  the  Size  , ComparisonOperator , and
                 FieldToMatch to build an expression  in  the  form  of  "Size
                 ComparisonOperator  size  in bytes of FieldToMatch ". If that
                 expression is  true,  the  SizeConstraint  is  considered  to
                 match.

                 FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                     Specifies  where  in  a  web request to look for the size
                     constraint.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The part of the web request that you want AWS  WAF  to
                        search for a specified string. Parts of a request that
                        you can search include the following:

                        o HEADER : A specified request  header,  for  example,
                          the  value  of  the User-Agent or Referer header. If
                          you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name  of
                          the header in Data .

                        o METHOD  :  The HTTP method, which indicated the type
                          of operation that the request is asking  the  origin
                          to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following
                          methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD ,  OPTIONS  ,  PATCH  ,
                          POST , and PUT .

                        o QUERY_STRING  : A query string, which is the part of
                          a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                        o URI : The part of a web request  that  identifies  a
                          resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                        o BODY : The part of a request that contains any addi-
                          tional data that you want to send to your web server
                          as  the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
                          The request body  immediately  follows  the  request
                          headers.  Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the
                          request body are forwarded to AWS  WAF  for  inspec-
                          tion. To allow or block requests based on the length
                          of the body, you can create a size  constraint  set.
                          For more information, see  CreateSizeConstraintSet .

                        o SINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string
                          that you will inspect, such as UserName or  SalesRe-
                          gion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30
                          characters.

                        o ALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG  ,  but
                          rather  than  inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF
                          will inspect all parameters within the query for the
                          value  or  regex pattern that you specify in Target-
                          String .

                     Data -> (string)
                        When the value of Type is HEADER , enter the  name  of
                        the  header that you want AWS WAF to search, for exam-
                        ple, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is
                        not case sensitive.

                        When the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the
                        name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search,
                        for  example,  UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter
                        name is not case sensitive.

                        If the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .

                 TextTransformation -> (string)
                     Text transformations eliminate some of the  unusual  for-
                     matting  that  attackers use in web requests in an effort
                     to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a  transformation,  AWS
                     WAF  performs  the  transformation on FieldToMatch before
                     inspecting it for a match.

                     You can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.

                     Note that if you choose BODY for the value of Type ,  you
                     must  choose  NONE  for TextTransformation because Cloud-
                     Front forwards only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.
                        NONE

                     Specify NONE if you don't want to perform any text trans-
                     formations.
                        CMD_LINE

                     When you're concerned that attackers are injecting an op-
                     erating system command line  command  and  using  unusual
                     formatting  to  disguise  some or all of the command, use
                     this option to perform the following transformations:

                     o Delete the following characters: " ' ^

                     o Delete spaces before the following characters: / (

                     o Replace the following characters with a space: , ;

                     o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                     o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE

                     Use this option to replace the following characters  with
                     a space character (decimal 32):

                     o f, formfeed, decimal 12

                     o t, tab, decimal 9

                     o n, newline, decimal 10

                     o r, carriage return, decimal 13

                     o v, vertical tab, decimal 11

                     o non-breaking space, decimal 160
                        COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also  replaces  multiple  spaces
                        with one space.

                        HTML_ENTITY_DECODE

                     Use this option to replace HTML-encoded  characters  with
                     unencoded  characters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  performs  the
                     following operations:

                     o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                     o Replaces (ampersand)nbsp; with  a  non-breaking  space,
                       decimal 160

                     o Replaces (ampersand)lt; with a "less than" symbol

                     o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                     o Replaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal
                       format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters

                     o Replaces  characters  that  are  represented in decimal
                       format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,  with  the  corresponding
                       characters
                        LOWERCASE

                     Use  this  option  to  convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to
                     lowercase (a-z).
                        URL_DECODE

                     Use this option to decode a URL-encoded value.

                 ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                     The type of comparison you want AWS WAF to  perform.  AWS
                     WAF  uses  this in combination with the provided Size and
                     FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of  "Size
                     ComparisonOperator  size  in  bytes of FieldToMatch ". If
                     that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered
                     to match.
                        EQ  : Used to test if the Size is equal to the size of
                        the FieldToMatch

                        NE : Used to test if the Size is not equal to the size
                        of the FieldToMatch

                        LE : Used to test if the Size is less than or equal to
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                        LT : Used to test if the Size is  strictly  less  than
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                        GE : Used to test if the Size is greater than or equal
                        to the size of the FieldToMatch

                        GT : Used to test if the Size is strictly greater than
                        the size of the FieldToMatch

                 Size -> (long)
                     The  size  in  bytes  that  you  want  AWS WAF to compare
                     against the size of the specified FieldToMatch . AWS  WAF
                     uses  this  in  combination  with  ComparisonOperator and
                     FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of  "Size
                     ComparisonOperator  size  in  bytes of FieldToMatch ". If
                     that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered
                     to match.

                     Valid  values  for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20
                     GB).

                     If you specify URI for the value of Type , the /  in  the
                     URI  counts  as  one  character.  For  example,  the  URI
                     /logo.jpg is nine characters long.
