NAME
       delete-application-output -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the output destination configuration from your SQL-based Kine-
       sis Data Analytics application's configuration. Kinesis Data  Analytics
       will  no longer write data from the corresponding in-application stream
       to the external output destination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-application-output
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --output-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The application name.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The application version. You can use the  DescribeApplication opera-
          tion  to  get the current application version. If the version speci-
          fied is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException
          is returned.

       --output-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  configuration to delete. Each output configuration
          that is added to the application (either  when  the  application  is
          created  or  later)  using the  AddApplicationOutput operation has a
          unique ID. You need to provide the ID to uniquely identify the  out-
          put  configuration that you want to delete from the application con-
          figuration. You can use the  DescribeApplication  operation  to  get
          the specific OutputId .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationARN -> (string)
          The application Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

       ApplicationVersionId -> (long)
          The current application version ID.
