ROLLBACK-APPLICATION()                                  ROLLBACK-APPLICATION()



NAME
       rollback-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Reverts  the  application to the previous running version. You can roll
       back an application if you suspect it is stuck in a transient status.

       You can roll back an application only if it is in the UPDATING  or  AU-
       TOSCALING status.

       When  you  rollback  an  application, it loads state data from the last
       successful snapshot. If the application has no snapshots, Kinesis  Data
       Analytics rejects the rollback request.

       This  action is not supported for Kinesis Data Analytics for SQL appli-
       cations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            rollback-application
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The current application version ID. You can retrieve the application
          version ID using  DescribeApplication .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        NOTE:
                            If this value is set to DEFAULT , the  application
                            will  use  the  following values, even if they are
                            set to other  values  using  APIs  or  application
                            code:

                            o CheckpointingEnabled: true

                            o CheckpointInterval: 60000

                        NOTE:
                            If  CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType   is
                            DEFAULT , the application will use a Checkpointin-
                            gEnabled value of true , even if this value is set
                            to  another value using this API or in application
                            code.

                     CheckpointInterval -> (long)
                        Describes the interval in milliseconds between  check-
                        point operations.

                        NOTE:
                            If   CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType  is
                            DEFAULT , the application will use a CheckpointIn-
                            terval  value  of 60000, even if this value is set

                        Describes  the  minimum  time  in milliseconds after a
                        checkpoint operation completes that a  new  checkpoint
                        operation can start.

                        NOTE:
                            If   CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType  is
                            DEFAULT , the application will use  a  MinPauseBe-
                            tweenCheckpoints value of 5000, even if this value
                            is set using this API or in application code.

                 MonitoringConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                     Describes configuration parameters for Amazon  CloudWatch
                     logging for an application.

                     ConfigurationType -> (string)
                        Describes  whether  to use the default CloudWatch log-
                        ging configuration for an application.

                        Describes the granularity of the CloudWatch  Logs  for
                        an application.

                     LogLevel -> (string)
                        Describes  the verbosity of the CloudWatch Logs for an
                        application.

                 ParallelismConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
                     Describes parameters for how an application executes mul-
                     tiple tasks simultaneously.

                     ConfigurationType -> (string)
                        Describes  whether  the  application  uses the default
                        parallelism for the Kinesis Data Analytics service.

                     Parallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes the initial number of parallel tasks that  a
                        Flink-based  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application can
                        perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set  to  True,  then
                        Kinesis  Data Analytics can increase the CurrentParal-
                        lelism value in response to application load. The ser-
                        vice can increase CurrentParallelism up to the maximum
                        parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times the max-
                        imum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs for an
                        application is 32 by default, and can be increased  by
                        requesting  a  limit  increase. If application load is
                        reduced, the service can reduce the CurrentParallelism
                        value down to the Parallelism setting.

                     ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                        Describes   the   number  of  parallel  tasks  that  a
                        Flink-based Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application  can
                        perform  per Kinesis Processing Unit (KPU) used by the
                        application.

                     CurrentParallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes the current number of parallel tasks that  a
                        Flink-based  Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application can
                        perform. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, Kinesis
                        Data  Analytics can increase this value in response to
                        application load. The service can increase this  value
                        up  to  the maximum parallelism, which is Paralellism-
                        PerKPU times the maximum KPUs for the application. The
                        maximum  KPUs for an application is 32 by default, and
                        can be increased by requesting a  limit  increase.  If
                        application  load  is  reduced, the service can reduce
                        the CurrentParallelism value down to  the  Parallelism
                        setting.

                     AutoScalingEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Describes  whether  the Kinesis Data Analytics service
                        can increase the parallelism of the application in re-
                        sponse to increased throughput.

                 JobPlanDescription -> (string)
                     The  job  plan  for  an application. For more information
                     about the job plan, see Jobs and Scheduling in the Apache
                     Flink  Documentation  .  To retrieve the job plan for the
                     application,  use   the    DescribeApplicationRequest$In-
                     cludeAdditionalDetails parameter of the  DescribeApplica-
