DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()                                DISCOVER-INPUT-SCHEMA()



NAME
       discover-input-schema -

DESCRIPTION
       Infers  a  schema for a SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application by
       evaluating sample records on the specified  streaming  source  (Kinesis
       data  stream or Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) or Amazon S3 ob-
       ject. In the response, the operation returns the  inferred  schema  and
       also the sample records that the operation used to infer the schema.

       You can use the inferred schema when configuring a streaming source for
       your application. When you create an application using the Kinesis Data
       Analytics  console,  the  console uses this operation to infer a schema
       and show it in the console user interface.

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the streaming source.

       --service-execution-role (string)
          The ARN of the role that is used to access the streaming source.

       --input-starting-position-configuration (structure)
          The point at which you want Kinesis Data Analytics to start  reading
          records from the specified streaming source for discovery purposes.

          InputStartingPosition -> (string)
              The starting position on the stream.

              o NOW  -  Start reading just after the most recent record in the
                stream, and start at the request timestamp that  the  customer
                issued.

              o TRIM_HORIZON  -  Start reading at the last untrimmed record in
                the stream, which  is  the  oldest  record  available  in  the
                stream.  This  option  is  not available for an Amazon Kinesis
                Data Firehose delivery stream.

              o LAST_STOPPED_POINT - Resume reading from where the application
                last stopped reading.

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       InputSchema -> (structure)
          The schema inferred from the streaming  source.  It  identifies  the
          format of the data in the streaming source and how each data element
          maps to corresponding columns in the in-application stream that  you
          can create.

          RecordFormat -> (structure)
              Specifies the format of the records on the streaming source.

              RecordFormatType -> (string)
                 The type of record format.

              MappingParameters -> (structure)
                 When  you configure application input at the time of creating
                 or updating an application, provides additional  mapping  in-
                 formation  specific  to the record format (such as JSON, CSV,
                 or record fields delimited by some delimiter) on the  stream-
                 ing source.

                 JSONMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional mapping information when JSON is the
                     record format on the streaming source.

                     RecordRowPath -> (string)

                 CSVMappingParameters -> (structure)
                     Provides  additional  mapping information when the record
                     format uses delimiters (for example, CSV).

                     RecordColumnDelimiter -> (string)
                        The  column delimiter. For example, in a CSV format, a
                        comma (",") is the typical column delimiter.

          RecordEncoding -> (string)
              Specifies the encoding of the records in the  streaming  source.
              For example, UTF-8.

                 For a SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics application, describes
                 the mapping of each data element in the streaming  source  to

                 Mapping -> (string)
                     A reference to the data element in the streaming input or
                     the reference data source.

                 SqlType -> (string)
                     The type of column created in  the  in-application  input
