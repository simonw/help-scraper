ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT-PROCESSIADD-APPLICATION-INPUT-PROCESSING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       add-application-input-processing-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  InputProcessingConfiguration to a SQL-based Kinesis Data Ana-
       lytics application. An input processor pre-processes records on the in-
       put  stream  before the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the
       only input processor available is Amazon Lambda .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-application-input-processing-configuration
          --application-name <value>
          --current-application-version-id <value>
          --input-id <value>
          --input-processing-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application to which you want to add the input  pro-
          cessing configuration.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The  version  of  the application to which you want to add the input
          processing configuration. You can use the  DescribeApplication oper-
          ation  to get the current application version. If the version speci-
          fied is not the current version, the ConcurrentModificationException
          is returned.

       --input-id (string)
          The  ID  of the input configuration to add the input processing con-
          figuration to. You can get a list of the input IDs for  an  applica-
          tion using the  DescribeApplication operation.

       --input-processing-configuration (structure)
          The  InputProcessingConfiguration to add to the application.

          InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
              The  InputLambdaProcessor that is used to preprocess the records
              in the stream before being processed by your application code.

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of  the  Amazon  Lambda  function  that  operates  on
                 records in the stream.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: Amazon Lambda

       Shorthand Syntax:

          InputLambdaProcessor={ResourceARN=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "InputLambdaProcessor": {
              "ResourceARN": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the application.

       ApplicationVersionId -> (long)
          Provides the current application version.

       InputId -> (string)
          The input ID that is associated with the application input. This  is
          the  ID that Kinesis Data Analytics assigns to each input configura-
          tion that you add to your application.

       InputProcessingConfigurationDescription -> (structure)
          The description of the preprocessor that executes on records in this
          input before the application's code is run.

          InputLambdaProcessorDescription -> (structure)
              Provides  configuration information about the associated  Input-
              LambdaProcessorDescription

              ResourceARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the Amazon Lambda function that is used to prepro-
                 cess the records in the stream.

                 NOTE:
                     To specify an earlier version of the Lambda function than
                     the latest, include the Lambda function  version  in  the
                     Lambda  function  ARN.  For more information about Lambda
                     ARNs, see Example ARNs: Amazon Lambda

              RoleARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of the IAM role that is used  to  access  the  Amazon
                 Lambda function.

                 NOTE:
                     Provided  for  backward  compatibility. Applications that
                     are created with the current API version have an applica-
                     tion-level  service  execution  role  rather  than  a re-
                     source-level role.
