                 (structure)
                     When  you configure the application input for a SQL-based
                     Kinesis  Data  Analytics  application,  you  specify  the
                     streaming  source, the in-application stream name that is
                     created, and the mapping between the two.

                        The name prefix to use when creating an in-application
                        stream.  Suppose that you specify a prefix "MyInAppli-
                        cationStream ." Kinesis Data  Analytics  then  creates
                        one  or  more  (as  per the InputParallelism count you
                        specified) in-application streams with the names "MyI-

                     CheckpointingEnabled  , CheckpointInterval , or MinPause-
                     BetweenCheckpoints parameters.

                     NOTE:
                        If this value is set to DEFAULT , the application will
                        use  the  following  values,  even  if they are set to
                        other values using APIs or application code:

                        o CheckpointingEnabled: true

                        FAULT , the application will  use  a  CheckpointingEn-
                        abled value of true , even if this value is set to an-
                        other value using this API or in application code.

                 CheckpointInterval -> (long)
                     Describes the interval in milliseconds between checkpoint
                     operations.

                     NOTE:
                        If  CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType  is  DE-
                        FAULT , the application will use a  CheckpointInterval
                        value  of  60000, even if this value is set to another
                        value using this API or in application code.

                 MinPauseBetweenCheckpoints -> (long)
                     Describes the minimum time in milliseconds after a check-
                     point operation completes that a new checkpoint operation
                     can start. If a checkpoint operation  takes  longer  than
                     the  CheckpointInterval  , the application otherwise per-
                     forms continual checkpoint operations. For more  informa-
                     tion,  see Tuning Checkpointing in the Apache Flink Docu-
                     mentation .

                     NOTE:
                        If  CheckpointConfiguration.ConfigurationType  is  DE-
                        FAULT   ,  the  application  will  use  a  MinPauseBe-
                        tweenCheckpoints value of 5000, even if this value  is
                        set using this API or in application code.

                     lelism  for the Managed Service for Apache Flink service.
                     You must set this property to CUSTOM in order  to  change
                     your  application's AutoScalingEnabled , Parallelism , or
                     ParallelismPerKPU properties.

                 Parallelism -> (integer)
                     Describes the initial number of  parallel  tasks  that  a
                     Managed Service for Apache Flink application can perform.
                     If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, Managed Service for
                     Apache  Flink  increases  the CurrentParallelism value in
                     response to application load. The  service  can  increase
                     the  CurrentParallelism value up to the maximum parallel-
                     ism, which is ParalellismPerKPU times  the  maximum  KPUs
                     for  the application. The maximum KPUs for an application
                     is 32 by default, and can be increased  by  requesting  a
                     limit  increase. If application load is reduced, the ser-
                     vice can reduce the CurrentParallelism value down to  the
                     Parallelism setting.

                 ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                     Describes  the  number  of  parallel tasks that a Managed
                     Service for Apache Flink application can perform per  Ki-
                     nesis  Processing Unit (KPU) used by the application. For
                     more information about KPUs, see Amazon  Managed  Service
                     for Apache Flink Pricing .

                        Describes whether the  application  uses  the  default
                        parallelism  for  the Managed Service for Apache Flink
                        service.

                     Parallelism -> (integer)
                        Describes the initial number of parallel tasks that  a
                        Managed  Service for Apache Flink application can per-
                        form. If AutoScalingEnabled is set to True, then  Man-
                        aged  Service  for  Apache Flink can increase the Cur-
                        rentParallelism value in response to application load.
                        The  service can increase CurrentParallelism up to the
                        maximum parallelism, which is ParalellismPerKPU  times
                        the maximum KPUs for the application. The maximum KPUs
                        for an application is 32 by default, and  can  be  in-
                        creased by requesting a limit increase. If application
                        load is reduced, the service can reduce  the  Current-
                        Parallelism value down to the Parallelism setting.

                     ParallelismPerKPU -> (integer)
                        Describes  the number of parallel tasks that a Managed
                        Service for Apache Flink application can  perform  per

                        Describes  the current number of parallel tasks that a
                        Managed Service for Apache Flink application can  per-
                        form.  If  AutoScalingEnabled  is set to True, Managed
                        Service for Apache Flink can increase  this  value  in
                        response to application load. The service can increase
                        this value up to the  maximum  parallelism,  which  is
                        ParalellismPerKPU  times  the maximum KPUs for the ap-
                        plication. The maximum KPUs for an application  is  32
                        by default, and can be increased by requesting a limit
                        increase. If application load is reduced, the  service
                        can  reduce  the  CurrentParallelism value down to the
                        Parallelism setting.

                        Describes whether the Managed Service for Apache Flink
                        service  can  increase the parallelism of the applica-
                        tion in response to increased throughput.
