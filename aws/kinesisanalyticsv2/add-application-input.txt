ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()                                ADD-APPLICATION-INPUT()



NAME
       add-application-input -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds a streaming source to your SQL-based Kinesis Data Analytics appli-
       cation.

       You can add a streaming source when you create an application,  or  you
       can  use  this  operation to add a streaming source after you create an
       application. For more information, see  CreateApplication .

       Any configuration update, including adding  a  streaming  source  using
       this  operation,  results  in a new version of the application. You can
       use the  DescribeApplication operation to find the current  application
       version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The  name  of your existing application to which you want to add the
          streaming source.

       --current-application-version-id (long)
          The current version of your application. You must provide the Appli-
          cationVersionID  or  the  ConditionalToken  .You  can  use  the  De-
          scribeApplication operation to find the current application version.

       --input (structure)
          The  Input to add.

          NamePrefix -> (string)
              The name prefix to use when creating an  in-application  stream.
              Suppose  that you specify a prefix "MyInApplicationStream ." Ki-
              nesis Data Analytics then creates one or more (as per the Input-
              Parallelism count you specified) in-application streams with the
              names "MyInApplicationStream_001  ,"  "MyInApplicationStream_002
              ," and so on.

              cessor transforms records as they are received from the  stream,
              before  the application's SQL code executes. Currently, the only
              input processing configuration available is   InputLambdaProces-
              sor .

              InputLambdaProcessor -> (structure)
                 The   InputLambdaProcessor  that  is  used  to preprocess the

                 tion code.

                 ResourceARN -> (string)
                     The  ARN  of  the Amazon Lambda function that operates on

                        To specify an earlier version of the  Lambda  function
                        than  the  latest, include the Lambda function version
                        in the Lambda function ARN. For more information about

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.
