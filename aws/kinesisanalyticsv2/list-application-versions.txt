NAME
       list-application-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the  versions for the specified application, including ver-
       sions that were rolled back. The response also includes  a  summary  of
       the configuration associated with each version.

       To  get the complete description of a specific application version, in-
       voke the  DescribeApplicationVersion operation.

       NOTE:
          This operation is supported only for Amazon Kinesis  Data  Analytics
          for Apache Flink.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-application-versions
          --application-name <value>
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of the application for which you want to list all versions.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of versions to list in this invocation of the op-
          eration.

       --next-token (string)
          If a previous invocation of this operation returned a pagination to-
          ken,  pass  it  into this value to retrieve the next set of results.
          For more information about pagination, see Using the Amazon  Command
          Line Interface's Pagination Options .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationVersionSummaries -> (list)
          A list of the application versions and the associated  configuration
          summaries.  The  list includes application versions that were rolled
          back.

          To get the complete description of a specific  application  version,
          invoke the  DescribeApplicationVersion operation.

          (structure)
              The summary of the application version.

              ApplicationVersionId -> (long)
                 The ID of the application version. Kinesis Data Analytics up-
                 dates the ApplicationVersionId each time you update  the  ap-
                 plication.

              ApplicationStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the application.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  pagination  token for the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results. To retrieve the next set of  items,  pass
          this  token into a subsequent invocation of this operation. For more
          information about pagination, see Using the Amazon Command Line  In-
          terface's Pagination Options .
