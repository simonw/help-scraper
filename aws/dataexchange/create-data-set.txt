SYNOPSIS
            create-data-set
          --asset-type <value>
          --description <value>
          --name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --asset-type (string)
          The type of asset that is added to a data set.

          Possible values:

          o S3_SNAPSHOT

          o REDSHIFT_DATA_SHARE

          o API_GATEWAY_API

       --description (string)
          A description for the data set. This value can be up to 16,348 char-
          acters long.

       --name (string)
          The name of the data set.

       --tags (map)
          A data set tag is an optional label that you can assign  to  a  data
          set  when  you create it. Each tag consists of a key and an optional
          value, both of which you define. When you use tagging, you can  also
          use  tag-based  access  control in IAM policies to control access to
          these data sets and revisions.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
