UPDATE-SCHEDULE()                                            UPDATE-SCHEDULE()



NAME
       update-schedule -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  specified schedule. When you call UpdateSchedule , Event-
       Bridge Scheduler uses all values, including empty values, specified  in
       the  request  and  overrides  the existing schedule. This is by design.
       This means that if you do not set an optional field  in  your  request,
       that field will be set to its system-default value after the update.

       Before calling this operation, we recommend that you call the GetSched-
       ule API operation and make a note of all optional parameters  for  your
       UpdateSchedule call.

OPTIONS
       --action-after-completion (string)
          Specifies  the  action  that  EventBridge  Scheduler  applies to the
          schedule after the schedule completes invoking the target.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o DELETE

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier you provide to ensure the  idempo-
          tency  of  the request. If you do not specify a client token, Event-
          Bridge Scheduler uses a randomly generated token for the request  to
          ensure idempotency.

       --description (string)
          The description you specify for the schedule.

       --end-date (timestamp)
          The  date,  in UTC, before which the schedule can invoke its target.
          Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might
          stop  on,  or before, the EndDate you specify. EventBridge Scheduler
          ignores EndDate for one-time schedules.

       --flexible-time-window (structure)
          Allows you to configure  a  time  window  during  which  EventBridge
          Scheduler invokes the schedule.

          MaximumWindowInMinutes -> (integer)
              The maximum time window during which a schedule can be invoked.

          Mode -> (string)
              Determines  whether  the  schedule  is invoked within a flexible
              time window.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MaximumWindowInMinutes=integer,Mode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MaximumWindowInMinutes": integer,
            "Mode": "OFF"|"FLEXIBLE"
          }

       --group-name (string)
          The name of the schedule group with which the  schedule  is  associ-
          ated. You must provide this value in order for EventBridge Scheduler
          to find the schedule you want to update. If  you  omit  this  value,
          EventBridge Scheduler assumes the group is associated to the default
          group.

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The ARN for the customer managed KMS key that that you  want  Event-
          Bridge Scheduler to use to encrypt and decrypt your data.

       --name (string)
          The name of the schedule that you are updating.

       --schedule-expression (string)
          The  expression  that  defines when the schedule runs. The following
          formats are supported.

          o at expression - at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)

          o rate expression - rate(value unit)

          o cron expression - cron(fields)

          You can use at expressions to create one-time schedules that  invoke
          a  target  once, at the time and in the time zone, that you specify.
          You can use rate and cron expressions to create recurring schedules.
          Rate-based  schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target at
          regular intervals, such as every 15  minutes  or  every  five  days.
          Cron-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target pe-
          riodically at a specific time, such as at 8:00 am (UTC+0) every  1st
          day of the month.

          A  cron expression consists of six fields separated by white spaces:
          (minutes hours day_of_month month day_of_week year) .

          A rate expression consists of a value as a positive integer,  and  a
          unit  with  the following options: minute | minutes | hour | hours |
          day | days

          For more information and examples, see Schedule types on EventBridge
          Scheduler in the EventBridge Scheduler User Guide .

       --schedule-expression-timezone (string)
          The timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated.

       --start-date (timestamp)
          The  date,  in  UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its
          target. Depending on the schedule's recurrence  expression,  invoca-
          tions  might  occur  on, or after, the StartDate you specify. Event-
          Bridge Scheduler ignores StartDate for one-time schedules.

       --state (string)
          Specifies whether the schedule is enabled or disabled.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --target (structure)
          The schedule target. You can use this operation to change the target
          that your schedule invokes.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target.

          DeadLetterConfig -> (structure)
              An  object  that  contains information about an Amazon SQS queue
              that EventBridge Scheduler uses as a dead-letter queue for  your
              schedule.  If  specified,  EventBridge Scheduler delivers failed
              events that could not be successfully delivered to a  target  to
              the queue.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SQS queue specified as
                 the destination for the dead-letter queue.

          EcsParameters -> (structure)
              The  templated  target  type  for  the  Amazon  ECS  `   RunTask
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html`__
              API operation.

              CapacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                 The capacity provider strategy to use for the task.

                 (structure)
                     The details of a capacity provider strategy.

                     base -> (integer)
                        The base value designates how many tasks, at  a  mini-
                        mum,  to  run on the specified capacity provider. Only
                        one capacity provider in a capacity provider  strategy
                        can have a base defined. If no value is specified, the
                        default value of 0 is used.

                     capacityProvider -> (string)
                        The short name of the capacity provider.

                     weight -> (integer)
                        The weight value designates the relative percentage of
                        the total number of tasks launched that should use the
                        specified capacity provider. The weight value is taken
                        into  consideration  after the base value, if defined,
                        is satisfied.

              EnableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed tags  for  the
                 task.  For  more information, see Tagging Your Amazon ECS Re-
                 sources in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              EnableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
                 Whether or not to enable the  execute  command  functionality
                 for  the  containers in this task. If true, this enables exe-
                 cute command functionality on all containers in the task.

              Group -> (string)
                 Specifies an ECS task group for the task. The maximum  length
                 is 255 characters.

              LaunchType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the launch type on which your task is running. The
                 launch type that you specify  here  must  match  one  of  the
                 launch type (compatibilities) of the target task. The FARGATE
                 value is supported only in the  Regions  where  Fargate  with
                 Amazon  ECS  is supported. For more information, see AWS Far-
                 gate on Amazon ECS in the Amazon ECS Developer Guide .

              NetworkConfiguration -> (structure)
                 This structure specifies the network configuration for an ECS
                 task.

                 awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the Amazon VPC subnets and security groups for
                     the task, and whether a public IP address is to be  used.
                     This  structure  is  relevant only for ECS tasks that use
                     the awsvpc network mode.

                     AssignPublicIp -> (string)
                        Specifies whether the task's elastic network interface
                        receives  a public IP address. You can specify ENABLED
                        only when LaunchType in EcsParameters is set  to  FAR-
                        GATE .

                     SecurityGroups -> (list)
                        Specifies  the  security  groups  associated  with the
                        task. These security groups must all be  in  the  same
                        VPC.  You can specify as many as five security groups.
                        If you do not specify a security  group,  the  default
                        security group for the VPC is used.

                        (string)

                     Subnets -> (list)
                        Specifies  the subnets associated with the task. These
                        subnets must all be in the same VPC. You  can  specify
                        as many as 16 subnets.

                        (string)

              PlacementConstraints -> (list)
                 An array of placement constraint objects to use for the task.
                 You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (including con-
                 straints  in  the task definition and those specified at run-
                 time).

                 (structure)
                     An object representing a constraint on task placement.

                     expression -> (string)
                        A cluster query language expression to  apply  to  the
                        constraint.  You  cannot  specify an expression if the
                        constraint type is distinctInstance . For more  infor-
                        mation,  see  Cluster query language in the Amazon ECS
                        Developer Guide .

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of constraint. Use distinctInstance to ensure
                        that  each  task in a particular group is running on a
                        different container instance. Use memberOf to restrict
                        the selection to a group of valid candidates.

              PlacementStrategy -> (list)
                 The task placement strategy for a task or service.

                 (structure)
                     The task placement strategy for a task or service.

                     field -> (string)
                        The field to apply the placement strategy against. For
                        the spread placement strategy, valid  values  are  in-
                        stanceId  (or instanceId , which has the same effect),
                        or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to
                        a container instance, such as attribute:ecs.availabil-
                        ity-zone . For the binpack placement  strategy,  valid
                        values  are  cpu and memory . For the random placement
                        strategy, this field is not used.

                     type -> (string)
                        The type of placement strategy. The  random  placement
                        strategy  randomly  places  tasks  on available candi-
                        dates. The spread placement strategy spreads placement
                        across  available candidates evenly based on the field
                        parameter. The binpack strategy places tasks on avail-
                        able  candidates  that have the least available amount
                        of the resource that is specified with the  field  pa-
                        rameter. For example, if you binpack on memory, a task
                        is placed on the instance with the least amount of re-
                        maining memory (but still enough to run the task).

              PlatformVersion -> (string)
                 Specifies the platform version for the task. Specify only the
                 numeric portion of the platform version, such as 1.1.0 .

              PropagateTags -> (string)
                 Specifies whether to propagate the tags from the task defini-
                 tion  to the task. If no value is specified, the tags are not
                 propagated. Tags can only be propagated to  the  task  during
                 task creation. To add tags to a task after task creation, use
                 Amazon            ECS's             `             TagResource
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_TagResource.html`__
                 API action.

              ReferenceId -> (string)
                 The reference ID to use for the task.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The metadata that you apply to the task to help  you  catego-
                 rize and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
                 tional value, both of which you define. For more information,
                 see                         `                         RunTask
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html`__
                 in the Amazon ECS API Reference .

                 (map)
                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

              TaskCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of tasks to create based on TaskDefinition . The
                 default is 1 .

              TaskDefinitionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task definition to  use
                 if the event target is an Amazon ECS task.

          EventBridgeParameters -> (structure)
              The  templated  target  type  for  the  EventBridge  ` PutEvents
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/APIReference/API_PutEvents.html`__
              API operation.

              DetailType -> (string)
                 A free-form string, with a maximum of 128 characters, used to
                 decide what fields to expect in the event detail.

              Source -> (string)
                 The source of the event.

          Input -> (string)
              The text, or well-formed JSON, passed to the target. If you  are
              configuring  a  templated  Lambda, AWS Step Functions, or Amazon
              EventBridge target, the input must be a  well-formed  JSON.  For
              all  other  target  types, a JSON is not required. If you do not
              specify anything for this field, EventBridge Scheduler  delivers
              a default notification to the target.

          KinesisParameters -> (structure)
              The templated target type for the Amazon Kinesis ` PutRecord ki-
              nesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecord.html`__ API operation.

                 Specifies the shard to which EventBridge Scheduler sends  the
                 event.  For more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
                 terminology and concepts in the Amazon Kinesis Streams Devel-
                 oper Guide .

          RetryPolicy -> (structure)
              A  RetryPolicy  object that includes information about the retry
              policy settings, including the maximum age of an event, and  the
              maximum  number  of  times EventBridge Scheduler will try to de-
              liver the event to a target.

              MaximumEventAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The maximum amount of time, in seconds, to continue  to  make
                 retry attempts.

              MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of retry attempts to make before the re-
                 quest fails. Retry attempts with exponential backoff continue
                 until  either the maximum number of attempts is made or until
                 the duration of the MaximumEventAgeInSeconds is reached.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that  EventBridge

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
