       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To page a contact's contact channels

       The   following  start-engagement  pages  contact's  contact  channels.
       Sender, subject, public-subject, and public-content are all  free  from
       fields.  Incident Manager sends the subject and content to the provided
       VOICE or EMAIL contact channels. Incident Manager sends the public-sub-
       ject and public-content to the provided SMS contact channels. Sender is
       used to track who started the engagement.

          aws ssm-contacts start-engagement \
              --contact-id  "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:contact/akuam" \
              --sender "cli" \
              --subject "cli-test" \
              --content "Testing engagements via CLI" \
              --public-subject "cli-test" \
              --public-content "Testing engagements va CLI"

       Output:

          {
              "EngagementArn": "arn:aws:ssm-contacts:us-east-2:111122223333:engagement/akuam/607ced0e-e8fa-4ea7-8958-a237b8803f8f"

       Example 2: To page a contact in the provided escalation plan.

       The following start-engagement engages contact's through an  escalation
       plan. Each contact is paged according to their engagement plan.
