OPTIONS
       --contact-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the contact  you  are  adding  the
          contact channel to.

       --name (string)
          The name of the contact channel.

       --type (string)
          Incident Manager supports three types of contact channels:

          o SMS

          o VOICE

          o EMAIL

          Possible values:

          o SMS

          o VOICE

          o EMAIL

       --delivery-address (structure)
          The  details  that  Incident  Manager uses when trying to engage the
          contact channel. The format is dependent on the type of the  contact
          channel. The following are the expected formats:

          o SMS - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

          o VOICE - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

          o EMAIL - any standard email format

          SimpleAddress -> (string)
              The  format is dependent on the type of the contact channel. The
              following are the expected formats:

              o SMS - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

              o VOICE - '+' followed by the country code and phone number

              o EMAIL - any standard email format

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SimpleAddress=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SimpleAddress": "string"
          }

       --defer-activation | --no-defer-activation (boolean)
          If you want to activate the channel at a later time, you can  choose
          to  defer  activation.  Incident  Manager  can't engage your contact
          channel until it has been activated.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the operation is called  only  once  with  the
          specified details.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
