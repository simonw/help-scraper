LIST-METRIC-SETS()                                          LIST-METRIC-SETS()



NAME
       list-metric-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the datasets in the current AWS Region.

       Amazon  Lookout  for  Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If
       you do a read operation on a resource  immediately  after  creating  or
       modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to com-
       plete.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-metric-sets
          [--anomaly-detector-arn <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The ARN of the anomaly detector containing the metrics sets to list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --next-token (string)
          If the result of the previous request was  truncated,  the  response
          includes  a NextToken . To retrieve the next set of results, use the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MetricSetSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of the datasets in the AWS Region, with configuration details
          for each.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a dataset.

              MetricSetArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the dataset.

              AnomalyDetectorArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the detector to which the dataset belongs.

              MetricSetDescription -> (string)
                 The description of the dataset.

              MetricSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the dataset.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the dataset was created.

              LastModificationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the dataset was last modified.

              Tags -> (map)
                 The dataset's tags .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response is truncated, the list call returns this token. To
          retrieve the next set of results, use the token in the next list re-
          quest.
