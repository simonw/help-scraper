LIST-ALERTS()                                                    LIST-ALERTS()



NAME
       list-alerts -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the alerts attached to a detector.

       Amazon  Lookout  for  Metrics API actions are eventually consistent. If
       you do a read operation on a resource  immediately  after  creating  or
       modifying it, use retries to allow time for the write operation to com-
       plete.

SYNOPSIS
            list-alerts
          [--anomaly-detector-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --anomaly-detector-arn (string)
          The ARN of the alert's detector.

       --next-token (string)
          If the result of the previous request is truncated, the response in-
          cludes  a  NextToken  . To retrieve the next set of results, use the
          token in the next request. Tokens expire after 24 hours.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results that will be displayed by the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The name of the alert.

              AlertSensitivityThreshold -> (integer)
