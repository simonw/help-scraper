DESCRIPTION
       This is the Recycle Bin API Reference . This documentation provides de-
       scriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in Recycle
       Bin.

       Recycle  Bin is a resource recovery feature that enables you to restore
       accidentally deleted snapshots and EBS-backed AMIs. When using  Recycle
       Bin,  if  your  resources are deleted, they are retained in the Recycle
       Bin for a time period that you specify.

       You can restore a resource from the Recycle Bin at any time before  its
       retention period expires. After you restore a resource from the Recycle
       Bin, the resource is removed from the Recycle Bin, and you can then use
       it  in the same way you use any other resource of that type in your ac-
       count. If the retention period expires and  the  resource  is  not  re-
       stored, the resource is permanently deleted from the Recycle Bin and is
       no longer available for recovery. For more  information  about  Recycle
       Bin, see Recycle Bin in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide .
