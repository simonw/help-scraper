LIST-HARVEST-JOBS()                                        LIST-HARVEST-JOBS()



NAME
       list-harvest-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a collection of HarvestJob records.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-harvest-jobs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: HarvestJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-harvest-jobs
          [--include-channel-id <value>]
          [--include-status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --include-channel-id (string) When specified, the request  will  return
       only HarvestJobs associated with the given Channel ID.

       --include-status  (string) When specified, the request will return only
       HarvestJobs in the given status.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HarvestJobs -> (list)
          A list of HarvestJob records.

          (structure)
              A HarvestJob resource configuration

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned to the HarvestJob.

              ChannelId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Channel that the HarvestJob will harvest from.

              CreatedAt -> (string)
                 The time the HarvestJob was submitted

              EndTime -> (string)
                 The end of the time-window which will be harvested.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID of the HarvestJob. The ID must be  unique  within  the
                 region  and it cannot be changed after the HarvestJob is sub-
                 mitted.

              OriginEndpointId -> (string)
                 The ID of the OriginEndpoint that the HarvestJob will harvest
                 from.  This cannot be changed after the HarvestJob is submit-
                 ted.

              S3Destination -> (structure)
                 Configuration parameters for where in an S3 bucket  to  place
                 the harvested content

                 BucketName -> (string)
                     The  name  of an S3 bucket within which harvested content
                     will be exported

                 ManifestKey -> (string)
                     The key in the specified S3 bucket  where  the  harvested
                     top-level manifest will be placed.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     The IAM role used to write to the specified S3 bucket

              StartTime -> (string)
                 The start of the time-window which will be harvested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  current  status of the HarvestJob. Consider setting up a
                 CloudWatch Event to listen for HarvestJobs as they succeed or
                 fail.  In the event of failure, the CloudWatch Event will in-
                 clude an explanation of why the HarvestJob failed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token that can be used to resume pagination from the  end  of  the
          collection.
