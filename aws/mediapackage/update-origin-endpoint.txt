                 32-character string, used in conjunction with the key for en-
                 crypting  blocks.  If  you don't specify a value, then Media-
                 Package creates the constant initialization vector (IV).

              EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                 The encryption method to use.

              KeyRotationIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 Time (in seconds) between each encryption key rotation.

              SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                 A configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and
                 Encoder  Key  Exchange  (SPEKE) service that will provide en-
                 cryption keys.

                 CertificateArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  a  Certificate  Manager
                     certificate  that MediaPackage will use for enforcing se-
                     cure end-to-end data transfer with the key provider  ser-
                     vice.

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use  encryptionContractConfiguration  to configure one or
                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

                     PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                        A collection of audio encryption presets.

                     PresetSpeke20Video -> (string)

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS El-
                     emental  MediaPackage  will assume when accessing the key
                     provider service.

                 SystemIds -> (list)
                     The system IDs to include in key requests.

                     (string)

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the external key provider service.

          HlsManifests -> (list)
              A list of HLS manifest configurations

              (structure)
                 A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming
                     (HLS)  manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.  "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to sig-
                     nal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF man-
                     ifests.  For  this  option,  you  must set a programDate-
                     TimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

                 AdTriggers -> (list)
                     A list of SCTE-35 message types that are  treated  as  ad
                     markers  in  the output. If empty, no ad markers are out-
                     put. Specify multiple items to create ad markers for  all
                     of the included message types.

                     (string)

                 AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
                     This  setting  allows  the  delivery restriction flags on
                     SCTE-35 segmentation descriptors to determine  whether  a
                     message  signals  an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no SCTE-35
                     messages become ads. Choosing "RESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35
                     messages  of  the types specified in AdTriggers that con-
                     tain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choos-
                     ing  "UNRESTRICTED"  means  SCTE-35 messages of the types
                     specified in AdTriggers that do not contain delivery  re-
                     strictions  will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH" means
                     all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers
                     will  be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages
                     do not have these flags and are always treated as ads  if
                     specified in AdTriggers.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within the
                     OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed after it is  cre-
                     ated.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When  enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional short string appended to the end of the Orig-
                     inEndpoint  URL.  If not specified, defaults to the mani-
                     festName for the OriginEndpoint.

                 PlaylistType -> (string)
                     The HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When  either
                     "EVENT"   or   "VOD"   is   specified,   a  corresponding
                     EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE entry will be included in  the  media
                     playlist.

                 PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                     Time  window  (in seconds) contained in each parent mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The  interval  (in  seconds)  between   each   EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata  messages
                     will  be  generated every 5 seconds using the ingest time
                     of the content. If the interval is not specified, or  set
                     to  0,  then  no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be in-
                     serted into manifests and no ID3Timed  Metadata  messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter, if any ID3 Timed Metadata  is  found  in  HTTP  Live
                     Streaming  (HLS)  input, it will be passed through to HLS
                     output.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments  will  be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration.

          SegmentPrefix -> (string)
              An  optional custom string that is prepended to the name of each
              segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.

       --hls-package  (structure)  An HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) packaging con-
       figuration.AdMarkers -> (string)
              This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the  pack-
              aged  OriginEndpoint.  "NONE"  will  omit all SCTE-35 ad markers
              from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes the manifest to contain  a
              copy  of  the  SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken directly from
              the input HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"
              generates ad markers and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages
              in the input source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to
              signal  ad  and  program transition events in HLS and CMAF mani-
              fests. For this option, you  must  set  a  programDateTimeInter-
              valSeconds value that is greater than 0.

              segmentation  descriptors to determine whether a message signals
              an ad. Choosing "NONE" means no  SCTE-35  messages  become  ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied in AdTriggers that contain delivery  restrictions  will  be
              treated  as  ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages
              of the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain  deliv-
              ery  restrictions  will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH" means
              all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in  AdTriggers  will
              be  treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not have
              these flags and are  always  treated  as  ads  if  specified  in
              AdTriggers.

                     more content encryption keys for your endpoints that  use
                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              specified ID3Timed Metadata messages will be generated  every  5
              seconds using the ingest time of the content. If the interval is
              not specified, or set to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags
              will  be  inserted  into manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata mes-
              sages will be generated. Note that irrespective of this  parame-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     SPEKE  2.0. The encryption contract defines which content
                     keys are used to encrypt the audio and  video  tracks  in
                     your  stream. To configure the encryption contract, spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the  following  considerations  when using encryptionCon-
                     tractConfiguration:  encryptionContractConfiguration  can
                     be  used  for  DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0.
                     SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You  must
                     disable  key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRo-
                     tationIntervalSeconds to 0.

              A list of HLS manifest configurations

              (structure)
                 A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                 AdMarkers -> (string)
                     This setting controls how ad markers are included in  the
                     packaged  OriginEndpoint. "NONE" will omit all SCTE-35 ad
                     markers from the output. "PASSTHROUGH" causes  the  mani-
                     fest  to  contain  a copy of the SCTE-35 ad markers (com-
                     ments) taken directly from the input HTTP Live  Streaming

                     and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the  input
                     source.  "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE tags to sig-
                     nal ad and program transition events in HLS and CMAF man-
                     ifests.  For  this  option,  you  must set a programDate-
                     TimeIntervalSeconds value that is greater than 0.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The ID of the manifest. The ID must be unique within  the
                     OriginEndpoint  and it cannot be changed after it is cre-
                     ated.

                 IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                     When enabled, an I-Frame only stream will be included  in
                     the output.

                 ManifestName -> (string)
                     An optional short string appended to the end of the Orig-
                     inEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults to  the  mani-
                     festName for the OriginEndpoint.

                 PlaylistType -> (string)
                     The  HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type. When either
                     "EVENT"  or   "VOD"   is   specified,   a   corresponding
                     EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE  entry  will be included in the media
                     playlist.

                 PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                     Time window (in seconds) contained in each  parent  mani-
                     fest.

                 ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                     The   interval   (in  seconds)  between  each  EXT-X-PRO-
                     GRAM-DATE-TIME tag inserted into manifests. Additionally,
                     when  an interval is specified ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated every 5 seconds using the  ingest  time
                     of  the content. If the interval is not specified, or set
                     to 0, then no EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags  will  be  in-
                     serted  into  manifests and no ID3Timed Metadata messages
                     will be generated. Note that irrespective of this parame-
                     ter,  if  any  ID3  Timed  Metadata is found in HTTP Live
                     Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed through  to  HLS
                     output.

                 Url -> (string)
                     The URL of the packaged OriginEndpoint for consumption.

                 AdTriggers -> (list)
                     A  list  of  SCTE-35 message types that are treated as ad
                     markers in the output. If empty, no ad markers  are  out-
                     put.  Specify multiple items to create ad markers for all
                     of the included message types.

                 AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
                     This setting allows the  delivery  restriction  flags  on
                     SCTE-35  segmentation  descriptors to determine whether a
                     message signals an ad. Choosing "NONE" means  no  SCTE-35
                     messages  become ads. Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35
                     messages of the types specified in AdTriggers  that  con-
                     tain delivery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choos-
                     ing "UNRESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages  of  the  types
                     specified  in AdTriggers that do not contain delivery re-
                     strictions will be treated as ads. Choosing "BOTH"  means
                     all SCTE-35 messages of the types specified in AdTriggers
                     will be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert  messages
                     do  not have these flags and are always treated as ads if
                     specified in AdTriggers.

          SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
              Duration (in seconds) of each segment. Actual segments  will  be
              rounded to the nearest multiple of the source segment duration.

          SegmentPrefix -> (string)
              An  optional custom string that is prepended to the name of each
              segment. If not specified, it defaults to the ChannelId.

              A list of SCTE-35 message types that are treated as  ad  markers
              in  the output. If empty, no ad markers are output. Specify mul-
              tiple items to create ad markers for all of the included message
              types.

              (string)

          AdsOnDeliveryRestrictions -> (string)
              This  setting  allows  the delivery restriction flags on SCTE-35
              segmentation descriptors to determine whether a message  signals
              an  ad.  Choosing  "NONE"  means no SCTE-35 messages become ads.
              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied  in  AdTriggers  that contain delivery restrictions will be
              treated as ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35  messages
              of  the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain deliv-
              ery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing  "BOTH"  means
              all  SCTE-35  messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will
              be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not  have

                 EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use encryptionContractConfiguration to configure  one  or
                     more  content encryption keys for your endpoints that use
                     SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which  content
                     keys  are  used  to encrypt the audio and video tracks in
                     your stream. To configure the encryption contract,  spec-
                     ify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note
                     the following considerations  when  using  encryptionCon-

              Choosing "RESTRICTED" means SCTE-35 messages of the types speci-
              fied  in  AdTriggers  that contain delivery restrictions will be
              treated as ads. Choosing "UNRESTRICTED" means  SCTE-35  messages
              of  the types specified in AdTriggers that do not contain deliv-
              ery restrictions will be treated as ads. Choosing  "BOTH"  means
              all  SCTE-35  messages of the types specified in AdTriggers will
              be treated as ads. Note that Splice Insert messages do not  have
              these  flags  and  are  always  treated  as  ads if specified in
