LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()                                LIST-ORIGIN-ENDPOINTS()



NAME
       list-origin-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a collection of OriginEndpoint records.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-origin-endpoints  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: OriginEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-origin-endpoints
          [--channel-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-id (string) When specified,  the  request  will  return  only
       OriginEndpoints associated with the given Channel ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all origin-endpoints on a channel

       The following list-origin-endpoints command lists  all  of  the  origin
       endpoints that are configured on the channel named test.

                            key provider service.

                        EncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)
                            Use encryptionContractConfiguration  to  configure
                            one  or more content encryption keys for your end-
                            points that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract
                            defines which content keys are used to encrypt the
                            audio and video tracks in your stream. To  config-

                            lowing  considerations  when  using encryptionCon-
                            tractConfiguration:   encryptionContractConfigura-
                            tion  can  be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that
                            use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on  the  CPIX  2.3
                            specification.  You  must disable key rotation for
                            this endpoint by  setting  keyRotationIntervalSec-
                            onds to 0.

                            PresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)
                               A collection of audio encryption presets.

                        ResourceId -> (string)
                            The resource ID to include in key requests.

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            An  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that
                            AWS Elemental MediaPackage will  assume  when  ac-
                            cessing the key provider service.

                        SystemIds -> (list)
                            The system IDs to include in key requests.

                            (string)

                        Url -> (string)

                 HlsManifests -> (list)
                     A list of HLS manifest configurations

                     (structure)
                        A HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) manifest configuration.

                        AdMarkers -> (string)
                            This  setting controls how ad markers are included
                            in the packaged OriginEndpoint. "NONE"  will  omit
                            all   SCTE-35   ad   markers   from   the  output.
                            "PASSTHROUGH" causes the  manifest  to  contain  a
                            copy  of  the  SCTE-35 ad markers (comments) taken
                            directly from the input HTTP Live Streaming  (HLS)
                            manifest.  "SCTE35_ENHANCED"  generates ad markers
                            and blackout tags based on SCTE-35 messages in the
                            input  source. "DATERANGE" inserts EXT-X-DATERANGE
                            tags to signal ad and program transition events in
                            HLS  and CMAF manifests. For this option, you must
                            set a programDateTimeIntervalSeconds value that is
                            greater than 0.

                        Id -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  manifest.  The ID must be unique
                            within the OriginEndpoint and it cannot be changed
                            after it is created.

                        IncludeIframeOnlyStream -> (boolean)
                            When  enabled,  an I-Frame only stream will be in-
                            cluded in the output.

                        ManifestName -> (string)
                            An optional short string appended to  the  end  of
                            the OriginEndpoint URL. If not specified, defaults
                            to the manifestName for the OriginEndpoint.

                        PlaylistType -> (string)
                            The HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) playlist type.  When
                            either  "EVENT"  or  "VOD"  is specified, a corre-
                            sponding EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE  entry  will  be  in-
                            cluded in the media playlist.

                        PlaylistWindowSeconds -> (integer)
                            Time  window (in seconds) contained in each parent
                            manifest.

                        ProgramDateTimeIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                            The interval (in seconds) between each  EXT-X-PRO-
                            GRAM-DATE-TIME  tag inserted into manifests. Addi-
                            tionally, when an interval is  specified  ID3Timed
                            Metadata  messages  will be generated every 5 sec-
                            onds using the ingest time of the content. If  the
                            interval  is  not  specified, or set to 0, then no
                            EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME tags will be inserted into
                            manifests  and  no ID3Timed Metadata messages will
                            be generated. Note that irrespective of  this  pa-
                            rameter,  if  any  ID3  Timed Metadata is found in
                            HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) input, it will be passed
                            through to HLS output.

                        Url -> (string)
                            The  URL  of  the packaged OriginEndpoint for con-
                            sumption.

                 SegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)
                     Duration (in seconds) of each  segment.  Actual  segments
                     will  be  rounded  to  the nearest multiple of the source
