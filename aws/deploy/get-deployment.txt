GET-DEPLOYMENT()                                              GET-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       get-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a deployment.

       NOTE:
          The  content  property  of the appSpecContent object in the returned
          revision is always null. Use GetApplicationRevision and  the  sha256
          property of the returned appSpecContent object to get the content of
          the deployments AppSpec file.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment
          --deployment-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment associated with the IAM  user  or  AWS
          account.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  get-deployment example displays information about a de-
       ployment that is associated with the user's AWS account.

          aws deploy get-deployment --deployment-id d-A1B2C3123

                     If the ETag is not specified as an input parameter,  ETag
                     validation of the object is skipped.

                     date and optional Lambda functions that validate  deploy-
                     ment lifecycle events.

              code -> (string)
                 For  more  information, see Error Codes for AWS CodeDeploy in

                 The error code:

                 o APPLICATION_MISSING: The application was missing. This  er-
                   ror  code  is  most  likely  raised  if  the application is
                   deleted after the deployment is created, but before  it  is
                   started.

                 o DEPLOYMENT_GROUP_MISSING: The deployment group was missing.
                   This error code is most likely  raised  if  the  deployment
                   group  is  deleted after the deployment is created, but be-
                   fore it is started.

                 o HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS: The deployment failed on too  many  in-
                   stances  to  be  successfully  deployed within the instance
                   health constraints specified.

                 o HEALTH_CONSTRAINTS_INVALID: The revision cannot be success-
                   fully deployed within the instance health constraints spec-
                   ified.

                 o IAM_ROLE_MISSING: The service role cannot be accessed.

                 o IAM_ROLE_PERMISSIONS: The service role does  not  have  the
                   correct permissions.

                 o INTERNAL_ERROR: There was an internal error.

                 o NO_EC2_SUBSCRIPTION:  The calling account is not subscribed
                   to Amazon EC2.

                 o NO_INSTANCES: No instances were specified, or no  instances
                   can be found.

                 o OVER_MAX_INSTANCES: The maximum number of instances was ex-
                   ceeded.

                 o THROTTLED: The operation was throttled because the  calling
                   account  exceeded  the throttling limits of one or more AWS
                   services.

                 o TIMEOUT: The deployment has timed out.

                 o REVISION_MISSING: The revision ID was missing.  This  error
                   code is most likely raised if the revision is deleted after
                   the deployment is created, but before it is started.

              message -> (string)
                 An accompanying error message.

          createTime -> (timestamp)

              the deployment group.

              In  some  cases,  the  reported value of the start time might be
              later than the complete time. This is due to differences in  the
              clock  settings  of  backend servers that participate in the de-
              ployment process.

          completeTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that indicates when the deployment was complete.

          deploymentOverview -> (structure)

              ployment.

                 progress.

              Failed -> (long)
                 The number of instances in the deployment in a failed state.

              Skipped -> (long)
                 The number of instances in the deployment in a skipped state.

              Ready -> (long)
                 The number of instances in a replacement environment ready to
                 receive traffic in a blue/green deployment.

          description -> (string)
              A comment about the deployment.

          creator -> (string)
              The means by which the deployment was created:

              o user : A user created the deployment.

              o autoscaling : Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling created the deployment.

              o codeDeployRollback : A rollback process  created  the  deploy-
                ment.

              o CodeDeployAutoUpdate  : An auto-update process created the de-
                ployment when it detected outdated EC2 instances.

          ignoreApplicationStopFailures -> (boolean)
              If true, then if an ApplicationStop ,  BeforeBlockTraffic  ,  or
              AfterBlockTraffic  deployment  lifecycle  event  to  an instance
              fails, then the deployment  continues  to  the  next  deployment
              lifecycle  event. For example, if ApplicationStop fails, the de-
              ployment continues with  DownloadBundle.  If  BeforeBlockTraffic
              fails,  the  deployment  continues  with  BlockTraffic  . If Af-
              terBlockTraffic fails, the deployment  continues  with  Applica-
              tionStop .

              If  false or not specified, then if a lifecycle event fails dur-
              ing a deployment to an instance, that deployment fails.  If  de-
              ployment  to  that instance is part of an overall deployment and
              the number of healthy hosts is not less than the minimum  number
              of  healthy hosts, then a deployment to the next instance is at-
              tempted.

              During a deployment, the AWS CodeDeploy agent runs  the  scripts
              specified  for  ApplicationStop  ,  BeforeBlockTraffic , and Af-
              terBlockTraffic in the AppSpec file from the previous successful
              deployment.  (All other scripts are run from the AppSpec file in
              the current deployment.) If one of these scripts contains an er-
              ror and does not run successfully, the deployment can fail.

              If the cause of the failure is a script from the last successful
              deployment that will never run successfully, create  a  new  de-
              ployment  and  use ignoreApplicationStopFailures to specify that
              the ApplicationStop , BeforeBlockTraffic , and AfterBlockTraffic
              failures should be ignored.

                 triggered  a  rollback  deployment  because  it failed or was
                 stopped.

              rollbackMessage -> (string)
                 Information that describes the status of a  deployment  roll-
