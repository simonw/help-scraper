            get-deployment-target
          [--deployment-id <value>]
          [--target-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --target-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment target.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return information about a deployment target

       The following get-deployment-target example returns information about a
       deployment target that is associated with the specified deployment.

          aws deploy get-deployment-target \
              --deployment-id "d-A1B2C3111" \
              --target-id "i-a1b2c3d4e5f611111"

       Output:

          such as its status, lifecycle events, and when it was last  updated.
          It  also  contains metadata about the deployment target. The deploy-
          ment target metadata depends on the deployment  target's  type  (in-

                 (structure)
                     Information about a set of Amazon ECS  tasks  in  an  AWS
                     CodeDeploy  deployment.  An  Amazon ECS task set includes
                     details such as the desired number  of  tasks,  how  many
                     tasks  are  running, and whether the task set serves pro-
                     duction traffic. An AWS CodeDeploy application that  uses
                     the  Amazon  ECS compute platform deploys a containerized
                     application in an Amazon ECS service as a task set.

                     identifer -> (string)
                        A unique ID of an ECSTaskSet .

                     desiredCount -> (long)
                        The number of tasks in a task set. During a deployment
                        that  uses the Amazon ECS compute type, CodeDeploy in-
                        structs Amazon ECS to create a new task set  and  uses
                        this  value to determine how many tasks to create. Af-
                        ter the updated task set is created, CodeDeploy shifts
                        traffic to the new task set.

                     pendingCount -> (long)
                        The  number  of  tasks in the task set that are in the
                        PENDING status during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task
                        in the PENDING state is preparing to enter the RUNNING
                        state. A task set enters the PENDING  status  when  it
                        launches  for  the first time, or when it is restarted
                        after being in the STOPPED state.

                     runningCount -> (long)
                        The number of tasks in the task set that  are  in  the
                        RUNNING status during an Amazon ECS deployment. A task
                        in the RUNNING state is running and ready for use.

                     status -> (string)
                        The status of the task set. There are three valid task
                        set statuses:

                        o PRIMARY  : Indicates the task set is serving produc-
                          tion traffic.

                        o ACTIVE : Indicates the task set is not serving  pro-
                          duction traffic.

                        o DRAINING  :  Indicates the tasks in the task set are
                          being stopped and their  corresponding  targets  are
                          being deregistered from their target group.

                     trafficWeight -> (double)
                        The percentage of traffic served by this task set.

                     targetGroup -> (structure)
                        The  target  group  associated  with the task set. The
                        target group is used by AWS CodeDeploy to manage traf-
                        fic to a task set.

                        name -> (string)
                            For blue/green deployments, the name of the target
                            group that instances in the  original  environment
                            are  deregistered  from,  and instances in the re-
                            placement environment  are  registered  with.  For
                            in-place deployments, the name of the target group
                            that instances are deregistered from, so they  are
                            not  serving traffic during a deployment, and then
                            re-registered with after the  deployment  is  com-
                            plete.

                     taskSetLabel -> (string)
                        A label that identifies whether the ECS task set is an
                        original target (BLUE ) or a replacement target (GREEN
                        ).
