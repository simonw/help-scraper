       To deregister an on-premises instance

       The following deregister example deregisters  an  on-premises  instance
       with AWS CodeDeploy. It does not delete the IAM user that is associated
       with the instance. It disassociates in AWS CodeDeploy  the  on-premises
       tags  from the instance. It does not uninstall the AWS CodeDeploy Agent
       from the instance nor remove the on-premises  configuration  file  from
       the instance.

          aws deploy deregister \
              --instance-name AssetTag12010298EX \
              --no-delete-iam-user \
              --region us-west-2
