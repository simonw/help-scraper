                     The path used by a  load  balancer  to  route  production
                     traffic when an Amazon ECS deployment is complete.

                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of one listener. The
                        listener identifies the route between a  target  group
                        and  a load balancer. This is an array of strings with
                        a maximum size of one.

                     An optional path used by a load balancer  to  route  test
                     traffic  after  an  Amazon ECS deployment. Validation can
                     occur while test traffic is served during a deployment.

                     listenerArns -> (list)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  one  listener.  The
                        listener  identifies  the route between a target group
                        and a load balancer. This is an array of strings  with
                        a maximum size of one.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To change information about a deployment group

       The following update-deployment-group example changes the settings of a
       deployment group that is associated with the specified application.

          aws deploy update-deployment-group \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --auto-scaling-groups My_CodeDeployDemo_ASG \
              --current-deployment-group-name WordPress_DG \
              --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.AllAtOnce \
              --ec2-tag-filters Key=Name,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE,Value=My_CodeDeployDemo \
              --new-deployment-group-name My_WordPress_DepGroup \
              --service-role-arn arn:aws:iam::80398EXAMPLE:role/CodeDeployDemo-2

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       hooksNotCleanedUp -> (list)
          If the output contains no data,  and  the  corresponding  deployment
          group contained at least one Auto Scaling group, AWS CodeDeploy suc-
          cessfully removed all corresponding  Auto  Scaling  lifecycle  event
          hooks from the AWS account. If the output contains data, AWS CodeDe-
          ploy could not remove some Auto Scaling lifecycle event  hooks  from
          the AWS account.

          (structure)
              Information about an Auto Scaling group.

              name -> (string)
                 The Auto Scaling group name.

              hook -> (string)
                 An Auto Scaling lifecycle event hook name.
