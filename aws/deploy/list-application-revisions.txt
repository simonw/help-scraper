LIST-APPLICATION-REVISIONS()                      LIST-APPLICATION-REVISIONS()



NAME
       list-application-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about revisions for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-application-revisions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: revisions

SYNOPSIS
            list-application-revisions
          --application-name <value>
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--s3-bucket <value>]
          [--s3-key-prefix <value>]
          [--deployed <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-name (string)
          The name of an AWS CodeDeploy application associated  with  the  IAM
          user or AWS account.

       --sort-by (string)
          The column name to use to sort the list results:

          o registerTime : Sort by the time the revisions were registered with
            AWS CodeDeploy.

          o firstUsedTime : Sort by the time the revisions were first used  in
            a deployment.

          o lastUsedTime  : Sort by the time the revisions were last used in a
            deployment.

          If not specified or set to null, the results are returned in an  ar-
          bitrary order.

          Possible values:

          o registerTime

          o firstUsedTime

          o lastUsedTime

       --sort-order (string)
          The order in which to sort the list results:

          o ascending : ascending order.

          o descending : descending order.

          If not specified, the results are sorted in ascending order.

          If set to null, the results are sorted in an arbitrary order.

          Possible values:

          o ascending

          o descending

       --s3-bucket (string)
          An Amazon S3 bucket name to limit the search for revisions.

          If set to null, all of the user's buckets are searched.

       --s3-key-prefix (string)
          A  key  prefix  for the set of Amazon S3 objects to limit the search
          for revisions.

       --deployed (string)
          Whether to list revisions based on whether the revision is the  tar-
          get revision of a deployment group:

          o include : List revisions that are target revisions of a deployment
            group.

          o exclude : Do not list revisions that are target revisions of a de-
            ployment group.

          o ignore : List all revisions.

          Possible values:

          o include

          o exclude

          o ignore

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about application revisions

       The  following  list-application-revisions example displays information
       about all application revisions that are associated with the  specified
       application.

          aws deploy list-application-revisions \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --s-3-bucket CodeDeployDemoBucket \
              --deployed exclude \
              --s-3-key-prefix WordPress_ \
              --sort-by lastUsedTime \
              --sort-order descending

       Output:

          {
              "revisions": [
                  {

                  }
              ]
          }

                     includes information about which Lambda function  to  up-
                     date  and optional Lambda functions that validate deploy-
                     ment lifecycle events.

                 sha256 -> (string)

                 The content of an AppSpec file for an AWS  Lambda  or  Amazon
                 ECS  deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML and
                 stored as a RawString.

                 content -> (string)
                     The YAML-formatted or JSON-formatted revision string.

                     Lambda function name, the alias for its original version,
                     and the alias for its replacement version. The deployment
                     shifts  traffic  from  the original version of the Lambda
                     function to the replacement version.

                     For an Amazon ECS deployment, the  content  includes  the
                     task  name,  information  about  the  load  balancer that
                     serves traffic to the container, and more.

                     For both types of deployments, the  content  can  specify
                     Lambda functions that run at specified hooks, such as Be-
                     foreInstall , during a deployment.

                 sha256 -> (string)
                     The SHA256 hash value of the revision content.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If a large amount of information is returned, an identifier is  also
          returned.  It can be used in a subsequent list application revisions
          call to return the next set of application revisions in the list.
