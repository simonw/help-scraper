                     sents the bundled artifacts for the application revision.

                     If the version is not specified, the system uses the most

                     dled artifacts for the application revision.

                     If  the ETag is not specified as an input parameter, ETag
                     validation of the object is skipped.

              gitHubLocation -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  location  of  application  artifacts
                 stored in GitHub.

                     The GitHub account and repository pair that stores a ref-
                     erence to the commit that represents  the  bundled  arti-
                     facts for the application revision.

                     includes information about which Lambda function  to  up-
                     date  and optional Lambda functions that validate deploy-

                 ECS  deployment. The content is formatted as JSON or YAML and
                 stored as a RawString.

                 content -> (string)

                     Lambda function name, the alias for its original version,
                     and the alias for its replacement version. The deployment
                     shifts  traffic  from  the original version of the Lambda

                     serves traffic to the container, and more.

                     For both types of deployments, the  content  can  specify
                     Lambda functions that run at specified hooks, such as Be-
                     foreInstall , during a deployment.

                 sha256 -> (string)
                     The SHA256 hash value of the revision content.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          revisionType=string,s3Location={bucket=string,key=string,bundleType=string,version=string,eTag=string},gitHubLocation={repository=string,commitId=string},string={content=string,sha256=string},appSpecContent={content=string,sha256=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "revisionType": "S3"|"GitHub"|"String"|"AppSpecContent",
              "s3Location": {
                "bucket": "string",
                "key": "string",
                "bundleType": "tar"|"tgz"|"zip"|"YAML"|"JSON",
                "version": "string",
                "eTag": "string"
              },
              "gitHubLocation": {
                "repository": "string",
                "commitId": "string"
              },
              "string": {
                "content": "string",
                "sha256": "string"
              },

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
