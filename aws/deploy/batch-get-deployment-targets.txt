BATCH-GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()                  BATCH-GET-DEPLOYMENT-TARGETS()



NAME
       batch-get-deployment-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of one or more targets associated with a deployment.
       This method works with all compute types and should be used instead  of
       the deprecated BatchGetDeploymentInstances . The maximum number of tar-
       gets that can be returned is 25.

       The type of targets returned depends on the deployment's compute  plat-
       form or deployment method:

       o EC2/On-premises : Information about EC2 instance targets.

       o AWS Lambda : Information about Lambda functions targets.

       o Amazon ECS : Information about Amazon ECS service targets.

       o CloudFormation  : Information about targets of blue/green deployments
         initiated by a CloudFormation stack update.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-get-deployment-targets
          [--deployment-id <value>]
          [--target-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-id (string)
          The unique ID of a deployment.

       --target-ids (list)
          The unique IDs of the deployment targets. The  compute  platform  of
          the deployment determines the type of the targets and their formats.
          The maximum number of deployment target IDs you can specify is 25.

          o For deployments that use the EC2/On-premises compute platform, the
            target  IDs are EC2 or on-premises instances IDs, and their target
            type is instanceTarget .

          o For deployments that use the AWS Lambda compute platform, the tar-
            get  IDs  are the names of Lambda functions, and their target type
            is instanceTarget .

          o For deployments that use the Amazon ECS compute platform, the tar-
            get  IDs  are  pairs of Amazon ECS clusters and services specified
            using the format <clustername>:<servicename> . Their  target  type
            is ecsTarget .

          o For  deployments  that  are  deployed with AWS CloudFormation, the
            target IDs are CloudFormation stack  IDs.  Their  target  type  is
            cloudFormationTarget .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the targets associated with a deployment

       The  following batch-get-deployment-targets example returns information
       about one of the targets associated with the specified deployment.

              --deployment-id "d-1A2B3C4D5" \

                        CodeDeploy deployment. An Amazon ECS task set includes

                        tasks  are  running,  and  whether the task set serves
                        production traffic. An AWS CodeDeploy application that
                        uses  the  Amazon  ECS compute platform deploys a con-
                        tainerized application in an Amazon ECS service  as  a

                            The  number  of  tasks in a task set. During a de-
                            ployment that uses the Amazon  ECS  compute  type,
                            CodeDeploy  instructs  Amazon  ECS to create a new
                            task set and uses this value to determine how many
                            tasks  to  create.  After  the updated task set is
                            created, CodeDeploy shifts traffic to the new task
                            set.

                            ment.  A task in the PENDING state is preparing to
                            enter the RUNNING state. A  task  set  enters  the
                            PENDING  status  when  it  launches  for the first
                            time, or when it is restarted after being  in  the
                            STOPPED state.

                        runningCount -> (long)

                            ment.  A  task in the RUNNING state is running and
                            ready for use.

                              duction traffic.

                            o ACTIVE : Indicates the task set is  not  serving
                              production traffic.

                            o DRAINING  :  Indicates the tasks in the task set
                              are being stopped and their  corresponding  tar-
                              gets  are  being  deregistered from their target

                            target  group  is used by AWS CodeDeploy to manage
                            traffic to a task set.

                               in  the  replacement environment are registered
                               with. For in-place deployments, the name of the
                               target  group  that  instances are deregistered
                               from, so they are not serving traffic during  a
                               deployment,  and  then re-registered with after
                               the deployment is complete.
