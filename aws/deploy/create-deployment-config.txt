NAME
       create-deployment-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a deployment configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-deployment-config
          --deployment-config-name <value>
          [--minimum-healthy-hosts <value>]
          [--traffic-routing-config <value>]
          [--compute-platform <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-config-name (string)
          The name of the deployment configuration to create.

       --minimum-healthy-hosts (structure)
          The  minimum number of healthy instances that should be available at
          any time during the deployment. There are two parameters expected in
          the input: type and value.

          The type parameter takes either of the following values:

          o HOST_COUNT:  The  value parameter represents the minimum number of
            healthy instances as an absolute value.

          o FLEET_PERCENT: The value parameter represents the  minimum  number
            of  healthy  instances  as a percentage of the total number of in-
            stances in the deployment. If you specify  FLEET_PERCENT,  at  the
            start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to
            the equivalent number of instances and rounds  up  fractional  in-
            stances.

          The value parameter takes an integer.

          For  example,  to  set  a minimum of 95% healthy instance, specify a
          type of FLEET_PERCENT and a value of 95.

          type -> (string)
              The minimum healthy instance type:

              o HOST_COUNT : The minimum number of healthy instances as an ab-
                solute value.

              o FLEET_PERCENT  :  The minimum number of healthy instances as a
                percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment.

              In an example of nine instances, if a HOST_COUNT of six is spec-
              ified, deploy to up to three instances at a time. The deployment
              is successful if six or more instances are deployed to  success-
              fully. Otherwise, the deployment fails. If a FLEET_PERCENT of 40
              is specified, deploy to up to five instances at a time. The  de-
              ployment is successful if four or more instances are deployed to
              successfully. Otherwise, the deployment fails.

              NOTE:
                 In  a  call  to  the  GetDeploymentConfig   ,   CodeDeployDe-
                 fault.OneAtATime  returns  a minimum healthy instance type of
                 MOST_CONCURRENCY and a value of 1. This means a deployment to
                 only  one  instance  at  a  time. (You cannot set the type to
                 MOST_CONCURRENCY, only to HOST_COUNT  or  FLEET_PERCENT.)  In
                 addition,  with  CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime, AWS CodeDeploy
                 attempts to ensure that all instances but one are kept  in  a
                 healthy state during the deployment. Although this allows one
                 instance at a time to be taken offline for a new  deployment,
                 it  also  means  that  if the deployment to the last instance
                 fails, the overall deployment is still successful.

              For more information, see AWS CodeDeploy Instance Health in  the
              AWS CodeDeploy User Guide .

          value -> (integer)
              The minimum healthy instance value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,value=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "HOST_COUNT"|"FLEET_PERCENT",
            "value": integer
          }

       --traffic-routing-config (structure)
          The  configuration  that  specifies  how  the  deployment traffic is
          routed.

          type -> (string)
              The type of traffic shifting (TimeBasedCanary or TimeBasedLinear
              ) used by a deployment configuration.

          timeBasedCanary -> (structure)
              A configuration that shifts traffic from one version of a Lambda
              function or ECS task set to another in two increments. The orig-
              inal  and  target  Lambda function versions or ECS task sets are
              specified in the deployment's AppSpec file.

              canaryPercentage -> (integer)
                 The percentage of traffic to shift in the first increment  of
                 a TimeBasedCanary deployment.

              canaryInterval -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  minutes between the first and second traffic
                 shifts of a TimeBasedCanary deployment.

          timeBasedLinear -> (structure)
              A configuration that shifts traffic from one version of a Lambda
              function or ECS task set to another in equal increments, with an
              equal number of minutes between each increment. The original and
              target  Lambda  function versions or ECS task sets are specified
              in the deployment's AppSpec file.

              linearPercentage -> (integer)
                 The percentage of traffic that is shifted  at  the  start  of
                 each increment of a TimeBasedLinear deployment.

              linearInterval -> (integer)
                 The  number of minutes between each incremental traffic shift
                 of a TimeBasedLinear deployment.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,timeBasedCanary={canaryPercentage=integer,canaryInterval=integer},timeBasedLinear={linearPercentage=integer,linearInterval=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "TimeBasedCanary"|"TimeBasedLinear"|"AllAtOnce",
            "timeBasedCanary": {
              "canaryPercentage": integer,
              "canaryInterval": integer
            },
            "timeBasedLinear": {
              "linearPercentage": integer,
              "linearInterval": integer
            }
          }

       --compute-platform (string)
          The destination platform type for the deployment (Lambda , Server  ,
          or ECS ).

          Possible values:

          o Server

          o Lambda

          o ECS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a custom deployment configuration

       The following create-deployment-config example creates a custom deploy-
       ment configuration and associates it with the user's AWS account.

          aws deploy create-deployment-config \
              --deployment-config-name ThreeQuartersHealthy \
              --minimum-healthy-hosts type=FLEET_PERCENT,value=75

       Output:

          {
              "deploymentConfigId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       deploymentConfigId -> (string)
          A unique deployment configuration ID.
