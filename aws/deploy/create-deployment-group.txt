                            not serving traffic during a deployment, and  then
                            re-registered  with  after  the deployment is com-
                            plete.

                     The path used by a  load  balancer  to  route  production

                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of one listener. The
                        listener identifies the route between a  target  group
                        and  a load balancer. This is an array of strings with
                        a maximum size of one.

                     An optional path used by a load balancer  to  route  test
                     traffic  after  an  Amazon ECS deployment. Validation can
                     occur while test traffic is served during a deployment.

                     listenerArns -> (list)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  one  listener.  The

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a deployment group

       The  following  create-deployment-group  example  creates  a deployment
       group and associates it with the specified application and  the  user's
       AWS account.

          aws deploy create-deployment-group \
              --application-name WordPress_App \
              --auto-scaling-groups CodeDeployDemo-ASG \
              --deployment-config-name CodeDeployDefault.OneAtATime \
              --deployment-group-name WordPress_DG \
              --ec2-tag-filters Key=Name,Value=CodeDeployDemo,Type=KEY_AND_VALUE \
              --service-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CodeDeployDemoRole

       Output:

          {
              "deploymentGroupId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       deploymentGroupId -> (string)
          A unique deployment group ID.
