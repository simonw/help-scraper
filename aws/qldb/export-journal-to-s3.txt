EXPORT-JOURNAL-TO-S3()                                  EXPORT-JOURNAL-TO-S3()



NAME
       export-journal-to-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  journal  contents  within  a date and time range from a ledger
       into a specified Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)  bucket.  A
       journal export job can write the data objects in either the text or bi-
       nary representation of Amazon Ion format, or in JSON Lines text format.

       In JSON Lines format, each journal block in the exported data object is
       a  valid  JSON  object that is delimited by a newline. You can use this
       format to easily integrate JSON exports with analytics  tools  such  as
       Glue  and Amazon Athena because these services can parse newline-delim-
       ited JSON automatically. For more information  about  the  format,  see
       JSON Lines .

       If  the  ledger  with  the  given  Name  doesn't exist, then throws Re-
       sourceNotFoundException .

       If the ledger with the given Name is in CREATING  status,  then  throws
       ResourcePreconditionNotMetException .

       You  can initiate up to two concurrent journal export requests for each
       ledger. Beyond this limit, journal export requests  throw  LimitExceed-
       edException .

SYNOPSIS
            export-journal-to-s3
          --name <value>
          --inclusive-start-time <value>
          --exclusive-end-time <value>
          --s3-export-configuration <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          [--output-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --inclusive-start-time (timestamp)
          The  inclusive start date and time for the range of journal contents
          to export.

          The InclusiveStartTime must be in ISO 8601 date and time format  and
          in     Universal    Coordinated    Time    (UTC).    For    example:
          2019-06-13T21:36:34Z .

          The InclusiveStartTime must be before ExclusiveEndTime .

          If you provide an InclusiveStartTime that  is  before  the  ledger's
          CreationDateTime , Amazon QLDB defaults it to the ledger's Creation-
          DateTime .

       --exclusive-end-time (timestamp)
          The exclusive end date and time for the range of journal contents to
          export.

          The ExclusiveEndTime must be in ISO 8601 date and time format and in
          Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). For example:  2019-06-13T21:36:34Z
          .

          The  ExclusiveEndTime  must be less than or equal to the current UTC
          date and time.

       --s3-export-configuration (structure)
          The configuration settings of the Amazon S3 bucket  destination  for
          your export request.

          Bucket -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3 bucket name in which a journal export job writes
              the journal contents.

              The bucket name must comply with the  Amazon  S3  bucket  naming
              conventions.  For  more information, see Bucket Restrictions and
              Limitations in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

          Prefix -> (string)
              The prefix for the Amazon S3 bucket in which  a  journal  export
              job writes the journal contents.

              The  prefix  must comply with Amazon S3 key naming rules and re-
              strictions. For more information, see Object Key and Metadata in
              the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              The following are examples of valid Prefix values:

              o JournalExports-ForMyLedger/Testing/

              o JournalExports

              o My:Tests/

          EncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)
              The encryption settings that are used by a journal export job to
              write data in an Amazon S3 bucket.

              ObjectEncryptionType -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 object encryption type.

                 To learn more about server-side encryption options in  Amazon
                 S3,  see  Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the
                 Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric key in Key Man-
                 agement  Service (KMS). Amazon S3 does not support asymmetric
                 KMS keys.

                 You must provide a KmsKeyArn if you specify  SSE_KMS  as  the
                 ObjectEncryptionType .
                     KmsKeyArn  is  not  required if you specify SSE_S3 as the
                     ObjectEncryptionType .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bucket=string,Prefix=string,EncryptionConfiguration={ObjectEncryptionType=string,KmsKeyArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bucket": "string",
            "Prefix": "string",
            "EncryptionConfiguration": {
              "ObjectEncryptionType": "SSE_KMS"|"SSE_S3"|"NO_ENCRYPTION",
              "KmsKeyArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants QLDB per-
          missions for a journal export job to do the following:

          o Write  objects into your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
            bucket.

          o (Optional) Use your customer managed key in Key Management Service
            (KMS) for server-side encryption of your exported data.

          To  pass  a  role to QLDB when requesting a journal export, you must
          have permissions to perform the iam:PassRole action on the IAM  role
          resource. This is required for all journal export requests.

       --output-format (string)
          The  output  format of your exported journal data. If this parameter
          is not specified, the exported data defaults to ION_TEXT format.

          Possible values:

          o ION_BINARY

          o ION_TEXT

          o JSON

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To export journal blocks to S3

       The following export-journal-to-s3 example creates an  export  job  for
       journal  blocks  within  a  specified date and time range from a ledger
       with the name myExampleLedger. The export job writes the blocks into  a
       specified Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws qldb export-journal-to-s3 \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --inclusive-start-time 2019-09-18T00:00:00Z \
              --exclusive-end-time 2019-09-18T22:59:59Z \
              --role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-s3-export-role \
              --s3-export-configuration file://my-s3-export-config.json

       Contents of my-s3-export-config.json:

          {
              "Bucket": "awsExampleBucket",
              "Prefix": "ledgerexport1/",
              "EncryptionConfiguration": {
                  "ObjectEncryptionType": "SSE_S3"
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ExportId": "ADR2ONPKN5LINYGb4dp7yZ"
          }

       For  more information, see Exporting Your Journal in Amazon QLDB in the
       Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ExportId -> (string)
          The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) that QLDB  assigns  to
          each journal export job.

          To describe your export request and check the status of the job, you
          can use ExportId to call DescribeJournalS3Export .
