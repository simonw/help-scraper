NAME
       describe-journal-kinesis-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed information about a given Amazon QLDB journal stream.
       The output includes the Amazon Resource Name (ARN), stream  name,  cur-
       rent  status,  creation time, and the parameters of the original stream
       creation request.

       This action does not return any expired journal streams. For  more  in-
       formation,  see  Expiration for terminal streams in the Amazon QLDB De-
       veloper Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-journal-kinesis-stream
          --ledger-name <value>
          --stream-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ledger-name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --stream-id (string)
          The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of  the  QLDB  journal
          stream to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a journal stream

       The following describe-journal-kinesis-stream example displays the  de-
       tails for the specified journal stream from a ledger.

          aws qldb describe-journal-kinesis-stream \
              --ledger-name myExampleLedger \
              --stream-id 7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf

       Output:

          {
              "Stream": {
                  "LedgerName": "myExampleLedger",
                  "CreationTime": 1591221984.677,
                  "InclusiveStartTime": 1590710400.0,
                  "ExclusiveEndTime": 1590796799.0,
                  "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-kinesis-stream-role",
                  "StreamId": "7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf",
                  "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/myExampleLedger/7ISCkqwe4y25YyHLzYUFAf",
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "KinesisConfiguration": {
                      "StreamArn": "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:123456789012:stream/stream-for-qldb",
                      "AggregationEnabled": true
                  },
                  "StreamName": "myExampleLedger-stream"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Stream -> (structure)
          Information  about  the  QLDB  journal  stream  returned  by  a  De-
          scribeJournalS3Export request.

          LedgerName -> (string)
              The name of the ledger.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time, in epoch time format, when the QLDB journal
              stream was created. (Epoch time format is the number of  seconds
              elapsed since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

          InclusiveStartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  inclusive start date and time from which to start streaming
              journal data.

          ExclusiveEndTime -> (timestamp)
              The exclusive date and time that specifies when the stream ends.
              If this parameter is undefined, the stream runs indefinitely un-
              til you cancel it.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that grants  QLDB
              permissions  for a journal stream to write data records to a Ki-
              nesis Data Streams resource.

          StreamId -> (string)
              The UUID (represented in Base62-encoded text) of the QLDB  jour-
              nal stream.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the QLDB journal stream.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the QLDB journal stream.

          KinesisConfiguration -> (structure)
              The  configuration  settings  of the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams
              destination for a QLDB journal stream.

              StreamArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Kinesis  Data  Streams
                 resource.

              AggregationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Enables QLDB to publish multiple data records in a single Ki-
                 nesis Data Streams record, increasing the number  of  records
                 sent per API call.
                     This option is enabled by default. Record aggregation has
                     important implications for  processing  records  and  re-
                     quires  de-aggregation  in your stream consumer. To learn
                     more, see KPL Key Concepts and Consumer De-aggregation in
                     the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

          ErrorCause -> (string)
              The  error message that describes the reason that a stream has a
              status of IMPAIRED or FAILED . This is not applicable to streams
              that have other status values.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The user-defined name of the QLDB journal stream.
