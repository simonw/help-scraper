NAME
       update-ledger -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates properties on a ledger.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-ledger
          --name <value>
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--kms-key <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The  flag  that prevents a ledger from being deleted by any user. If
          not provided on ledger creation, this feature is enabled (true )  by
          default.

          If  deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it before
          you can delete the ledger. You can disable it  by  calling  the  Up-
          dateLedger operation to set the flag to false .

       --kms-key (string)
          The  key  in  Key  Management Service (KMS) to use for encryption of
          data at rest in the ledger. For more information, see Encryption  at
          rest in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide .

          Use one of the following options to specify this parameter:

          o AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY  :  Use  an KMS key that is owned and managed by
            Amazon Web Services on your behalf.

          o Undefined : Make no changes to the KMS key of the ledger.

          o A valid symmetric customer managed KMS key : Use the specified KMS
            key  in your account that you create, own, and manage. Amazon QLDB
            does not support asymmetric keys. For more information, see  Using
            symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Key Management Service Devel-
            oper Guide .

          To specify a customer managed KMS key, you can use its key ID,  Ama-
          zon  Resource  Name  (ARN),  alias name, or alias ARN. When using an
          alias name, prefix it with "alias/" . To specify a key in a  differ-
          ent  Amazon  Web Services account, you must use the key ARN or alias
          ARN.

          For example:

          o Key ID: 1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Key                                                           ARN:
            arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab

          o Alias name: alias/ExampleAlias

          o Alias ARN: arn:aws:kms:us-east-2:111122223333:alias/ExampleAlias

          For more information, see Key identifiers (KeyId) in the Key Manage-
          ment Service Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update the deletion protection property of a ledger

       The  following  update-ledger  example  updates the specified ledger to
       disable the deletion protection feature.

          aws qldb update-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --no-deletion-protection

       Output:

          {
              "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
              "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-west-2:123456789012:ledger/myExampleLedger",
              "DeletionProtection": false,
              "Name": "myExampleLedger",
              "State": "ACTIVE"
          }

       Example 2: To update the AWS KMS key of a ledger to a customer  managed
       key

       The following update-ledger example updates the specified ledger to use
       a customer managed KMS key for encryption at rest.

          aws qldb update-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --kms-key arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,

              }
          }

       Example 3: To update the AWS KMS key of a ledger to an AWS owned key

       The following update-ledger example updates the specified ledger to use
       an AWS owned KMS key for encryption at rest.

          aws qldb update-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger \
              --kms-key AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY

       Output:

              }
          }

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ledger.

       State -> (string)
          The current status of the ledger.

       CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time, in epoch time format, when the  ledger  was  cre-
          ated.  (Epoch  time  format  is  the number of seconds elapsed since
          12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
          The flag that prevents a ledger from being deleted by any  user.  If
          not  provided on ledger creation, this feature is enabled (true ) by
          default.

          If deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it  before
          you  can  delete  the  ledger. You can disable it by calling the Up-
          dateLedger operation to set the flag to false .

       EncryptionDescription -> (structure)
          Information about the encryption of data at rest in the ledger. This
          includes  the  current  status, the KMS key, and when the key became
          inaccessible (in the case of an error).

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed  KMS  key
              that  the  ledger uses for encryption at rest. If this parameter
              is undefined, the ledger uses an Amazon Web Services  owned  KMS
              key for encryption.

          EncryptionStatus -> (string)
              The current state of encryption at rest for the ledger. This can
              be one of the following values:

              o ENABLED : Encryption is fully enabled using the specified key.

              o UPDATING : The ledger is actively processing the specified key
                change.  Key  changes  in QLDB are asynchronous. The ledger is
                fully accessible without any performance impact while the  key
                change  is being processed. The amount of time it takes to up-
                date a key varies depending on the ledger size.

              o KMS_KEY_INACCESSIBLE : The specified customer managed KMS  key
                is  not accessible, and the ledger is impaired. Either the key
                was disabled or deleted, or the grants on  the  key  were  re-
                voked.  When  a  ledger  is impaired, it is not accessible and
                does not accept any read or write requests. An impaired ledger
                automatically returns to an active state after you restore the
                grants on the key, or re-enable the  key  that  was  disabled.
                However,  deleting a customer managed KMS key is irreversible.
                After a key is deleted, you can no longer access  the  ledgers
                that  are  protected with that key, and the data becomes unre-
                coverable permanently.

          InaccessibleKmsKeyDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time, in epoch time format, when the KMS key  first
              became inaccessible, in the case of an error. (Epoch time format
              is the number of seconds that have  elapsed  since  12:00:00  AM
              January 1, 1970 UTC.)

              This parameter is undefined if the KMS key is accessible.
