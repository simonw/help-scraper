OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the ledger that you want to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe a ledger

       The  following  describe-ledger  example  displays  the details for the
       specified ledger.

          aws qldb describe-ledger \
              --name myExampleLedger

       Output:

          {
              "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
              "Arn": "arn:aws:qldb:us-west-2:123456789012:ledger/myExampleLedger",
              "State": "ACTIVE",
              "Name": "myExampleLedger",
              "DeletionProtection": true,
              "PermissionsMode": "STANDARD",
              "EncryptionDescription": {
                  "KmsKeyArn": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "EncryptionStatus": "ENABLED"
              }
          }

       the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          The name of the ledger.

       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the ledger.

       State -> (string)
          The current status of the ledger.

       CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
          The  date  and  time, in epoch time format, when the ledger was cre-
          ated. (Epoch time format is the  number  of  seconds  elapsed  since
          12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       PermissionsMode -> (string)
          The permissions mode of the ledger.

       DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the ledger is protected from being deleted by any
          user. If not defined during ledger creation, this feature is enabled
          (true ) by default.

          If  deletion protection is enabled, you must first disable it before
          you can delete the ledger. You can disable it  by  calling  the  Up-
          dateLedger operation to set this parameter to false .

       EncryptionDescription -> (structure)
          Information about the encryption of data at rest in the ledger. This
          includes the current status, the KMS key, and when  the  key  became
          inaccessible  (in  the case of an error). If this parameter is unde-
          fined, the ledger uses an Amazon Web Services owned KMS key for  en-
          cryption.

          KmsKeyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the customer managed KMS key
              that the ledger uses for encryption at rest. If  this  parameter
              is  undefined,  the ledger uses an Amazon Web Services owned KMS
              key for encryption. It will display AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY  when  up-
              dating  the  ledger's encryption configuration to the Amazon Web
              Services owned KMS key.

          EncryptionStatus -> (string)
              The current state of encryption at rest for the ledger. This can
              be one of the following values:

              o ENABLED : Encryption is fully enabled using the specified key.

              o UPDATING : The ledger is actively processing the specified key
                change. Key changes in QLDB are asynchronous.  The  ledger  is
                fully  accessible without any performance impact while the key
                change is being processed. The amount of time it takes to  up-
                date a key varies depending on the ledger size.

              o KMS_KEY_INACCESSIBLE  : The specified customer managed KMS key
                is not accessible, and the ledger is impaired. Either the  key
                was  disabled  or  deleted,  or the grants on the key were re-
                voked. When a ledger is impaired, it  is  not  accessible  and
                does not accept any read or write requests. An impaired ledger
                automatically returns to an active state after you restore the
                grants  on  the  key,  or re-enable the key that was disabled.
                However, deleting a customer managed KMS key is  irreversible.
                After  a  key is deleted, you can no longer access the ledgers
                that are protected with that key, and the data  becomes  unre-
                coverable permanently.

          InaccessibleKmsKeyDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  date and time, in epoch time format, when the KMS key first
              became inaccessible, in the case of an error. (Epoch time format
              is  the  number  of  seconds that have elapsed since 12:00:00 AM
              January 1, 1970 UTC.)

              This parameter is undefined if the KMS key is accessible.
