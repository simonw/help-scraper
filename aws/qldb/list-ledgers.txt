LIST-LEDGERS()                                                  LIST-LEDGERS()



NAME
       list-ledgers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an array of ledger summaries that are associated with the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services account and Region.

       This action returns a maximum of 100 items and is paginated so that you
       can retrieve all the items by calling ListLedgers multiple times.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-ledgers
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of results to return in a single ListLedgers re-
          quest. (The actual number of results returned might be fewer.)

       --next-token (string)
          A pagination token, indicating that you want to  retrieve  the  next
          page  of  results.  If you received a value for NextToken in the re-
          sponse from a previous ListLedgers call, then you  should  use  that
          value as input here.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your available ledgers

       The following list-ledgers example lists all ledgers that  are  associ-
       ated with the current AWS account and Region.

          aws qldb list-ledgers

       Output:

          {
              "Ledgers": [
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839243.951,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger"
                  },
                  {
                      "State": "ACTIVE",
                      "CreationDateTime": 1568839543.557,
                      "Name": "myExampleLedger2"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Ledgers -> (list)
          The array of ledger summaries that are associated with  the  current
          Amazon Web Services account and Region.

          (structure)
              Information  about a ledger, including its name, state, and when
              it was created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the ledger.

              State -> (string)
                 The current status of the ledger.

              CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time, in epoch time format, when the ledger  was
                 created.  (Epoch time format is the number of seconds elapsed
                 since 12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token, indicating whether there are more results avail-
          able:

          o If NextToken is empty, then the last page of results has been pro-
            cessed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          o If NextToken is not empty, then there are more results  available.
            To  retrieve  the next page of results, use the value of NextToken
            in a subsequent ListLedgers call.
