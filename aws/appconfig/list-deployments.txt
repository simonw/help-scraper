LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()                                          LIST-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the deployments for an environment in descending deployment num-
       ber order.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-deployments
          --application-id <value>
          --environment-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --environment-id (string)
          The environment ID.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items that may be returned for this  call.  If
          there  are  items that have not yet been returned, the response will
          include a non-null NextToken that you can provide  in  a  subsequent
          call to get the next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token returned by a prior call to this operation indicating the
          next set of results to be returned. If not specified, the  operation
          will return the first set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available deployments

       The following list-deployments example lists the available  deployments
       in your AWS account for the specified application and environment.

          aws appconfig list-deployments \
              --application-id 339ohji \
              --environment-id 54j1r29

       Output:

          {
              "Items": [
                  {
                      "DeploymentNumber": 1,
                      "ConfigurationName": "Example-Configuration-Profile",
                      "ConfigurationVersion": "1",
                      "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 15,
                      "GrowthType": "LINEAR",
                      "GrowthFactor": 25.0,
                      "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
                      "State": "COMPLETE",
                      "PercentageComplete": 100.0,
                      "StartedAt": "2021-09-17T21:43:54.205000+00:00",
                      "CompletedAt": "2021-09-17T21:59:03.888000+00:00"
                  }
              ]
          }

              Information about the deployment.

              DeploymentNumber -> (integer)
                 The sequence number of the deployment.

              ConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration.

              DeploymentDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
                 Total amount of time the deployment lasted.

              GrowthType -> (string)
                 The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time.

              GrowthFactor -> (float)
                 The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration
                 during each interval.

              FinalBakeTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
                 The  amount of time that AppConfig monitors for alarms before
                 considering the deployment to be complete and no longer  eli-
