GET-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY()                            GET-DEPLOYMENT-STRATEGY()



NAME
       get-deployment-strategy -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information about a deployment strategy. A deployment strat-
       egy defines important criteria for rolling out  your  configuration  to
       the  designated targets. A deployment strategy includes the overall du-
       ration required, a percentage of targets to receive the deployment dur-
       ing  each interval, an algorithm that defines how percentage grows, and
       bake time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-deployment-strategy
          --deployment-strategy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-strategy-id (string)
          The ID of the deployment strategy to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve details of a deployment strategy

       The  following get-deployment-strategy example lists the details of the
       specified deployment strategy.

          aws appconfig get-deployment-strategy \
              --deployment-strategy-id 1225qzk

       Output:

          {
              "Id": "1225qzk",
              "Name": "Example-Deployment",
              "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 15,
              "GrowthType": "LINEAR",
              "GrowthFactor": 25.0,
              "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 0,
              "ReplicateTo": "SSM_DOCUMENT"
          }

       For more information, see Step 4: Creating a deployment strategy in the
       AWS AppConfig User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The deployment strategy ID.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the deployment strategy.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the deployment strategy.

       DeploymentDurationInMinutes -> (integer)
          Total amount of time the deployment lasted.

       GrowthType -> (string)
          The algorithm used to define how percentage grew over time.

       GrowthFactor -> (float)
          The  percentage  of  targets  that received a deployed configuration
          during each interval.

       FinalBakeTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
          The amount of time that AppConfig monitored for alarms  before  con-
          sidering  the  deployment  to be complete and no longer eligible for
          automatic rollback.

       ReplicateTo -> (string)
          Save the deployment strategy to a Systems Manager (SSM) document.
