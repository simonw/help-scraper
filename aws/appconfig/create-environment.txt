CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()                                      CREATE-ENVIRONMENT()



NAME
       create-environment -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  environment.  For each application, you define one or more
       environments. An environment is a deployment group  of  AppConfig  tar-
       gets, such as applications in a Beta or Production environment. You can
       also define environments for application subcomponents such as the  Web
       ,  Mobile and Back-end components for your application. You can config-
       ure Amazon CloudWatch alarms for each environment. The system  monitors
       alarms during a configuration deployment. If an alarm is triggered, the
       system rolls back the configuration.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-environment
          --application-id <value>
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--monitors <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The application ID.

       --name (string)
          A name for the environment.

       --description (string)
          A description of the environment.

       --monitors (list)
          Amazon CloudWatch alarms to monitor during the deployment process.

          (structure)
              Amazon  CloudWatch  alarms  to  monitor  during  the  deployment
              process.

              AlarmArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch alarm.

              AlarmRoleArn -> (string)
                 ARN  of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role for App-
                 Config to monitor AlarmArn .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AlarmArn=string,AlarmRoleArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AlarmArn": "string",
              "AlarmRoleArn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (map)
          Metadata to assign to the environment. Tags help organize and  cate-
          gorize  your  AppConfig resources. Each tag consists of a key and an
          optional value, both of which you define.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an environment

       The following create-environment example creates an AWS AppConfig envi-
       ronment named Example-Environment using the application you created us-
       ing create-application.

          aws appconfig create-environment \
              --application-id "339ohji" \
              --name "Example-Environment"

       Output:

          {
              "ApplicationId": "339ohji",
              "Description": null,
              "Id": "54j1r29",
              "Monitors": null,
              "Name": "Example-Environment",
              "State": "ReadyForDeployment"
          }

       AppConfig User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ApplicationId -> (string)
          The application ID.

       Id -> (string)
          The environment ID.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the environment.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the environment.

       State -> (string)
