SYNOPSIS
            update-deployment-strategy
          --deployment-strategy-id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--deployment-duration-in-minutes <value>]
          [--final-bake-time-in-minutes <value>]
          [--growth-factor <value>]
          [--growth-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --deployment-strategy-id (string)
          The deployment strategy ID.

       --description (string)
          A description of the deployment strategy.

       --deployment-duration-in-minutes (integer)
          Total amount of time for a deployment to last.

       --final-bake-time-in-minutes (integer)
          The amount of time that AppConfig monitors for alarms before consid-
          ering the deployment to be complete and no longer eligible for auto-
          matic rollback.

       --growth-factor (float)
          The percentage of targets to receive a deployed configuration during
          each interval.

       --growth-type (string)
          The algorithm used to define how percentage grows over time. AppCon-
          fig supports the following growth types:
              Linear  :  For  this type, AppConfig processes the deployment by
              increments of the growth factor evenly distributed over the  de-
              ployment  time.  For  example,  a  linear deployment that uses a
              growth factor of 20 initially makes the configuration  available
              to 20 percent of the targets. After 1/5th of the deployment time
              has passed, the system updates the  percentage  to  40  percent.
              This  continues until 100% of the targets are set to receive the
              deployed configuration.

              Exponential : For this type, AppConfig processes the  deployment
              exponentially  using  the  following  formula: G*(2^N) . In this
              formula, G is the growth factor specified by the user and  N  is
              the  number  of steps until the configuration is deployed to all
              targets. For example, if you specify a growth factor of 2,  then
              the system rolls out the configuration as follows:

              2*(2^0)

              2*(2^1)

              2*(2^2)

          Expressed  numerically,  the  deployment rolls out as follows: 2% of
          the targets, 4% of the targets, 8% of the targets, and continues un-
          til the configuration has been deployed to all targets.

          Possible values:

          o LINEAR

          o EXPONENTIAL

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a deployment strategy

       The  following  update-deployment-strategy  example  updates final bake
       time to 20 minutes in the specified deployment strategy.

          aws appconfig update-deployment-strategy \
              --deployment-strategy-id 1225qzk \
              --final-bake-time-in-minutes 20

       Output:

          {
              "Id": "1225qzk",
              "Name": "Example-Deployment",
              "DeploymentDurationInMinutes": 15,
              "GrowthType": "LINEAR",
              "GrowthFactor": 25.0,
              "FinalBakeTimeInMinutes": 20,
              "ReplicateTo": "SSM_DOCUMENT"
          }
