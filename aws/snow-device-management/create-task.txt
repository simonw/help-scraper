OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A token ensuring that the action is called only once with the speci-
          fied details.

       --command (structure)
          The task to be performed. Only one task is executed on a device at a
          time.

          reboot -> (structure)
              Reboots the device.

          unlock -> (structure)
              Unlocks the device.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          reboot={},unlock={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "reboot": {

            },
            "unlock": {

            }
          }

       --description (string)
          A description of the task and its targets.

       --tags (map)
          Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can use tags to
          categorize  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner,
          or environment.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --targets (list)
          A list of managed device IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       taskArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that you created.

       taskId -> (string)
          The ID of the task that you created.
