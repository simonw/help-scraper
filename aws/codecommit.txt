       Repositories, by calling the following:

       o BatchGetRepositories  ,  which  returns information about one or more
         repositories associated with your Amazon Web Services account.

       o CreateRepository , which creates an CodeCommit repository.

       o DeleteRepository , which deletes an CodeCommit repository.

       Approval rule templates, by calling the following:

       o AssociateApprovalRuleTemplateWithRepository , which associates a tem-

         template conditions on every pull request created  in  the  specified
         repository.

         plate  is  associated  with a repository, CodeCommit creates approval
         rules that match the template conditions on every pull  request  cre-
         ated in the specified repositories.

       o BatchDisassociateApprovalRuleTemplateFromRepositories , which removes
         the association between a template and specified repositories so that
         approval  rules  based  on the template are not automatically created
         when pull requests are created in those repositories.

       o CreateApprovalRuleTemplate , which creates a  template  for  approval
         rules  that  can  then be associated with one or more repositories in
         your Amazon Web Services account.

         does  not remove approval rules on pull requests already created with
         the template.

       o DisassociateApprovalRuleTemplateFromRepository ,  which  removes  the
         association  between  a  template  and  a repository so that approval
         rules based on the template are not automatically created  when  pull
         requests are created in the specified repository.

       o GetApprovalRuleTemplate , which returns information about an approval
         rule template.

       o ListApprovalRuleTemplates , which lists all approval  rule  templates
         in  the  Amazon  Web  Services Region in your Amazon Web Services ac-
         count.

       o DeleteCommentContent , which deletes the content of a  comment  on  a
         commit in a repository.

       o GetCommentReactions , which returns information about emoji reactions
         to comments.

       o GetCommentsForComparedCommit , which returns information  about  com-
         ments  on  the  comparison between two commit specifiers in a reposi-
         tory.

       o PostCommentForComparedCommit , which creates a comment on the compar-
         ison between two commit specifiers in a repository.

         comment.

       o UpdateComment , which updates the content of a comment on a commit in

         vicestags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in CodeCommit.

       o TagResource  ,  which adds or updates tags for a resource in CodeCom-
         mit.

         figured for a repository.

       o PutRepositoryTriggers  , which replaces all triggers for a repository
