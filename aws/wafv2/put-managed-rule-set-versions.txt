NAME
       put-managed-rule-set-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Defines  the versions of your managed rule set that you are offering to
       the customers. Customers see your offerings as managed rule groups with
       versioning.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

       Customers retrieve their managed rule group list by calling  ListAvail-
       ableManagedRuleGroups . The name that you provide here for your managed
       rule set is the name the customer sees for  the  corresponding  managed
       rule group. Customers can retrieve the available versions for a managed
       rule group by calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions . You pro-
       vide a rule group specification for each version. For each managed rule
       set, you must specify a version that you recommend using.

       To initiate the expiration of a managed rule group  version,  use   Up-
       dateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

SYNOPSIS
            put-managed-rule-set-versions
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          --lock-token <value>
          [--recommended-version <value>]
          [--versions-to-publish <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned  in
          the  responses  to commands like list . You provide it to operations
          like get and update .

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.

       --recommended-version (string)
          The version of the named managed rule group  that  you'd  like  your
          customers to choose, from among your version offerings.

       --versions-to-publish (map)
          The  versions of the named managed rule group that you want to offer
          to your customers.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A version of the named managed rule group, that the rule group's
              vendor publishes for use by customers.

              NOTE:
                 This  is  intended  for  use  only by vendors of managed rule
                 sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services
                 Marketplace sellers.

                 Vendors,  you  can  use  the managed rule set APIs to provide
                 controlled rollout of your versioned managed rule  group  of-
                 ferings  for your customers. The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets
                 , GetManagedRuleSet , PutManagedRuleSetVersions , and Update-
                 ManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

              AssociatedRuleGroupArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the vendor's rule group
                 that's used in the published managed rule group version.

              ForecastedLifetime -> (integer)
                 The amount of time the vendor expects  this  version  of  the
                 managed rule group to last, in days.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=AssociatedRuleGroupArn=string,ForecastedLifetime=integer,KeyName2=AssociatedRuleGroupArn=string,ForecastedLifetime=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "AssociatedRuleGroupArn": "string",
                "ForecastedLifetime": integer
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.
