NAME
       get-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified  RuleGroup .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-rule-group
          [--name <value>]
          [--scope <value>]
          [--id <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule
          group after you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier for the rule group. This ID is returned in the
          responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a specific custom rule group

       The following get-rule-group retrieves the custom rule group  with  the
       specified name, scope, and ID. You can get the ID for a rule group from
       the commands create-rule-group and list-rule-groups.

          aws wafv2 get-rule-group \
              --name ff \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

OUTPUT
       RuleGroup -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the rule group. You cannot change the name of a rule
              group after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A unique identifier for the rule group. This ID is  returned  in
              the responses to create and list commands. You provide it to op-
              erations like update and delete.

          Capacity -> (long)
              The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.

              When you create your own rule group, you define  this,  and  you
              cannot  change  it  after  creation.  When you add or modify the
              rules in a rule group, WAF enforces this limit.  You  can  check
              the capacity for a set of rules using  CheckCapacity .

              WAF  uses  WCUs to calculate and control the operating resources
              that are used to run your rules, rule groups, and web ACLs.  WAF
              calculates  capacity  differently for each rule type, to reflect
              the relative cost of each rule. Simple rules that cost little to
              run  use  fewer  WCUs than more complex rules that use more pro-
              cessing power. Rule group capacity is fixed at  creation,  which
              helps  users  plan  their web ACL WCU usage when they use a rule
              group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the rule group that helps with identification.

          Rules -> (list)
              The  Rule statements used to identify the web requests that  you
              want to allow, block, or count. Each rule includes one top-level
              statement that WAF uses to identify matching web  requests,  and
              parameters that govern how WAF handles them.

              (structure)
                 A  single  rule, which you can use in a  WebACL or  RuleGroup
                 to identify web requests that you want to  allow,  block,  or
                 count.  Each  rule includes one top-level  Statement that WAF
                 uses to identify matching web requests, and  parameters  that
                 govern how WAF handles them.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the rule. You can't change the name of a Rule
                     after you create it.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     If you define more than one Rule in a WebACL , WAF evalu-
                     ates each request against the Rules in order based on the
                     value of Priority . WAF processes rules with lower prior-
                     ity  first.  The priorities don't need to be consecutive,
                     but they must all be different.

                 Statement -> (structure)
                     The WAF processing statement for the  rule,  for  example
                     ByteMatchStatement or  SizeConstraintStatement .

                     ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that defines a string match search
                        for WAF to apply  to  web  requests.  The  byte  match
                        statement  provides the bytes to search for, the loca-
                        tion in requests that you  want  WAF  to  search,  and
                        other  settings. The bytes to search for are typically
                        a string that corresponds with  ASCII  characters.  In
                        the  WAF console and the developer guide, this is ref-
                        ered to as a string match statement.

                        SearchString -> (blob)
                            A string value that you want WAF  to  search  for.
                            WAF searches only in the part of web requests that
                            you designate for inspection  in   FieldToMatch  .
                            The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                            Valid  values  depend  on  the  component that you
                            specify for inspection in FieldToMatch :

                            o Method : The HTTP method that you  want  WAF  to
                              search for. This indicates the type of operation
                              specified in the request.

                            o UriPath : The value that you want WAF to  search
                              for   in   the   URI  path,  for  example,  /im-
                              ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                            If SearchString includes alphabetic characters A-Z
                            and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.
                               If you're using the WAF API

                            Specify a base64-encoded version of the value. The
                            maximum length of the value before you  base64-en-
                            code it is 50 bytes.

                            For  example,  suppose the value of Type is HEADER
                            and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you  want
                            to search the User-Agent header for the value Bad-
                            Bot  ,  you  base64-encode   BadBot   using   MIME
                            base64-encoding  and  include the resulting value,
                            QmFkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                               If you're using the CLI or one  of  the  Amazon
                               Web Services SDKs

                            The value that you want WAF to search for. The SDK
                            automatically base64 encodes the value.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  a  web  request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an 8 KB size limit on the body of the  request.
                               WAF  doesn't support inspecting the entire con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort to bypass detection. If you specify one
                            or more transformations in a rule  statement,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request component  identified  by  FieldToMatch  ,
                            starting  from the lowest priority setting, before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations that are defined for
                                   a rule statement. WAF processes all  trans-
                                   formations,  from  lowest priority to high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent.  The priorities don't need to be con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You can specify the  following  transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation that ignores  characters  that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness  of attackers who inject an operat-
                                      ing system command-line command and  use
                                      unusual  formatting  to disguise some or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete spaces before the following  char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace  the  following characters with a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace  these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also replaces mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded  using CSS 2.x escape rules syn-
                                      data.html#characters  .  This   function
                                      uses  up  to  two  bytes in the decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters  that  were encoded using CSS
                                      encoding that wouldnt typically  be  en-
                                      coded.  It's  also  useful in countering
                                      evasion, which is  a  combination  of  a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f  ,
                                      \n  , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,
                                      \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO  (octal).  En-
                                      codings  that aren't valid remain in the
                                      output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded characters with unencoded  charac-
                                      ters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces   (ampersand)lt;  with  a  "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in  decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn; ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences.  If a \  u  HHHH code is in the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and adjust the lower byte. If not,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed, causing a possible  loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE  -  Convert  uppercase letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5 - Calculate an  MD5  hash  from  the
                                      data  in the input. The computed hash is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE - Specify NONE if  you  don't  want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH    -    Remove   multiple
                                      slashes, directory self-references,  and
                                      directory  back-references  that are not
                                      at the beginning of the  input  from  an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but  first   converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated comments  are  also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE , but
                                      with support for  Microsoft-specific  %u
                                      encoding.   If   the   code  is  in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      ,  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                      adjust the lower byte.  Otherwise,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert  all   UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps input normalization, and  minimiz-
                                      ing  false-positives and false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                        PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                            The area within the portion of a web request  that
                            you  want  WAF  to search for SearchString . Valid
                            values include the following:
                               CONTAINS

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the  value  of  SearchString  ,  but  the location
                            doesn't matter.
                               CONTAINS_WORD

                            The specified part of the web request must include
                            the  value of SearchString , and SearchString must
                            contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore
                            (A-Z,  a-z,  0-9, or _). In addition, SearchString
                            must be a word, which means that both of the  fol-
                            lowing are true:

                            o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the speci-
                              fied part of the web request or is preceded by a
                              character  other  than an alphanumeric character
                              or underscore (_). Examples include the value of
                              a header and ;BadBot .

                            o SearchString is at the end of the specified part
                              of the web request or is followed by a character
                              other  than  an alphanumeric character or under-
                              score (_), for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .
                               EXACTLY

                            The value of the specified part of the web request
                            must exactly match the value of SearchString .
                               STARTS_WITH

                            The  value  of SearchString must appear at the be-
                            ginning of the specified part of the web request.
                               ENDS_WITH

                            The value of SearchString must appear at  the  end
                            of the specified part of the web request.

                     SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        Attackers sometimes insert malicious SQL code into web
                        requests in an effort to extract data from your  data-
                        base.  To  allow  or block web requests that appear to
                        contain malicious SQL code, create one or more SQL in-
                        jection  match conditions. An SQL injection match con-
                        dition identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                        the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF to in-
                        spect. Later in the process, when  you  create  a  web
                        ACL,  you  specify  whether to allow or block requests
                        that appear to contain malicious SQL code.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  a  web  request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an 8 KB size limit on the body of the  request.
                               WAF  doesn't support inspecting the entire con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort to bypass detection. If you specify one
                            or more transformations in a rule  statement,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request component  identified  by  FieldToMatch  ,
                            starting  from the lowest priority setting, before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations that are defined for
                                   a rule statement. WAF processes all  trans-
                                   formations,  from  lowest priority to high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent.  The priorities don't need to be con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You can specify the  following  transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation that ignores  characters  that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness  of attackers who inject an operat-
                                      ing system command-line command and  use
                                      unusual  formatting  to disguise some or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete spaces before the following  char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace  the  following characters with a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace  these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also replaces mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded  using CSS 2.x escape rules syn-
                                      data.html#characters  .  This   function
                                      uses  up  to  two  bytes in the decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters  that  were encoded using CSS
                                      encoding that wouldnt typically  be  en-
                                      coded.  It's  also  useful in countering
                                      evasion, which is  a  combination  of  a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f  ,
                                      \n  , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,
                                      \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO  (octal).  En-
                                      codings  that aren't valid remain in the
                                      output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded characters with unencoded  charac-
                                      ters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces   (ampersand)lt;  with  a  "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in  decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn; ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences.  If a \  u  HHHH code is in the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and adjust the lower byte. If not,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed, causing a possible  loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE  -  Convert  uppercase letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5 - Calculate an  MD5  hash  from  the
                                      data  in the input. The computed hash is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE - Specify NONE if  you  don't  want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH    -    Remove   multiple
                                      slashes, directory self-references,  and
                                      directory  back-references  that are not
                                      at the beginning of the  input  from  an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but  first   converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated comments  are  also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE , but
                                      with support for  Microsoft-specific  %u
                                      encoding.   If   the   code  is  in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      ,  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                      adjust the lower byte.  Otherwise,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert  all   UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps input normalization, and  minimiz-
                                      ing  false-positives and false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement that defines a  cross-site  scripting
                        (XSS)  match  search for WAF to apply to web requests.
                        XSS attacks are those where the attacker uses vulnera-
                        bilities  in  a  benign website as a vehicle to inject
                        malicious client-site scripts  into  other  legitimate
                        web browsers. The XSS match statement provides the lo-
                        cation in requests that you want  WAF  to  search  and
                        text  transformations to use on the search area before
                        WAF searches for character sequences that  are  likely
                        to be malicious strings.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide the
                               name of the query argument to inspect, such  as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This is used only to indicate the  web  request
                               component  for  WAF  to inspect, in the  Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": {  "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an 8 KB size limit on the body of the  request.
                               WAF  doesn't support inspecting the entire con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match  only the specified include paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide the  include  paths  using  JSON
                                      Pointer  syntax. For example, "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the JSON to match against  us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation  that  ignores characters that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding  that  wouldnt typically be en-
                                      coded. It's also  useful  in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH  (hexadecimal),  \0OOO (octal). En-
                                      codings that aren't valid remain in  the
                                      output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded  characters with unencoded charac-
                                      ters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs  these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences. If a \  u  HHHH code is in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and  adjust the lower byte. If not, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte  is zeroed, causing a possible loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL  bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each occur-
                                      rence of a C-style comment (/* ... */  )
                                      with  a  single space. Multiple consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated  comments  are  also replaced
                                      with a space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                      standalone  termination of a comment (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes  in
                                      the  input  with space characters (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex  data.
                                      Example  (0x414243  ) will be decoded to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that  compares  a  number of bytes
                        against the size of a request component, using a  com-
                        parison  operator,  such  as  greater than (>) or less
                        than (<). For example, you can use a  size  constraint
                        statement  to  look  for query strings that are longer
                        than 100 bytes.

                        If you configure WAF to inspect the request body,  WAF
                        inspects  only the first 8192 bytes (8 KB). If the re-
                        quest body for your web requests  never  exceeds  8192
                        bytes,  you can create a size constraint condition and
                        block requests that have a request body  greater  than
                        8192 bytes.

                        If you choose URI for the value of Part of the request
                        to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI counts  as  one
                        character.  For  example,  the  URI  /logo.jpg is nine
                        characters long.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  a  web  request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                            The operator to use to compare the request part to
                            the size setting.

                        Size -> (long)
                            The size, in byte, to compare to the request part,
                            after any transformations.

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort to bypass detection. If you specify one
                            or more transformations in a rule  statement,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request component  identified  by  FieldToMatch  ,
                            starting  from the lowest priority setting, before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations that are defined for
                                   a rule statement. WAF processes all  trans-
                                   formations,  from  lowest priority to high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent.  The priorities don't need to be con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You can specify the  following  transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation that ignores  characters  that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness  of attackers who inject an operat-
                                      ing system command-line command and  use
                                      unusual  formatting  to disguise some or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete spaces before the following  char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace  the  following characters with a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace  these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also replaces mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded  using CSS 2.x escape rules syn-
                                      data.html#characters  .  This   function
                                      uses  up  to  two  bytes in the decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters  that  were encoded using CSS
                                      encoding that wouldnt typically  be  en-
                                      coded.  It's  also  useful in countering
                                      evasion, which is  a  combination  of  a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f  ,
                                      \n  , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,
                                      \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO  (octal).  En-
                                      codings  that aren't valid remain in the

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded characters with unencoded  charac-
                                      ters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces   (ampersand)lt;  with  a  "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in  decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn; ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences.  If a \  u  HHHH code is in the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and adjust the lower byte. If not,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed, causing a possible  loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE  -  Convert  uppercase letters

                                      data  in the input. The computed hash is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE - Specify NONE if  you  don't  want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH    -    Remove   multiple
                                      slashes, directory self-references,  and
                                      directory  back-references  that are not
                                      at the beginning of the  input  from  an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but  first   converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated comments  are  also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE , but
                                      with support for  Microsoft-specific  %u
                                      encoding.   If   the   code  is  in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      ,  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                      adjust the lower byte.  Otherwise,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert  all   UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps input normalization, and  minimiz-
                                      ing  false-positives and false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to identify web  requests  based
                        on country of origin.

                        CountryCodes -> (list)
                            An array of two-character country codes, for exam-
                            ple, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the alpha-2 country ISO
                            codes of the ISO 3166 international standard.

                            (string)

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses in
                            an HTTP header that you specify, instead of  using
                            the  IP address that's reported by the web request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The  name  of the HTTP header to use for the IP
                               address.  For  example,  to  use   the   X-For-
                               warded-For  (XFF)  header,  set  this to X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The match status to assign to the  web  request
                               if  the request doesn't have a valid IP address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If the specified header  isn't  present  in
                                   the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You can specify the following  fallback  behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule statement. WAF applies the  rule  action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to run the rules  that  are  de-
                        fined  in  a   RuleGroup  . To use this, create a rule
                        group with your rules, then provide  the  ARN  of  the
                        rule group in this statement.

                        You  cannot  nest  a RuleGroupReferenceStatement , for
                        example for use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        You  can  only use a rule group reference statement at
                        the top level inside a web ACL.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules in the referenced rule group  whose  ac-
                            tions  are set to Count . When you exclude a rule,
                            WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the  rule
                            action  setting  were Count . This is a useful op-
                            tion for testing the rules in a rule group without
                            modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                     IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to detect  web  requests  coming
                        from particular IP addresses or address ranges. To use
                        this, create an  IPSet that  specifies  the  addresses
                        you  want  to  detect, then use the ARN of that set in
                        this statement. To create an IP set, see   CreateIPSet
                        .

                        Each  IP  set rule statement references an IP set. You
                        create and maintain the set independent of your rules.
                        This  allows  you  to  use  the single set in multiple
                        rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF  auto-
                        matically updates all rules that reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IPSet that
                            this statement references.

                        IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The configuration for inspecting IP  addresses  in
                            an  HTTP header that you specify, instead of using
                            the IP address that's reported by the web  request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If the specified header isn't  present  in  the
                               request,  WAF doesn't apply the rule to the web
                               request at all.

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The name of the HTTP header to use for  the  IP
                               address.   For   example,  to  use  the  X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header,  set  this  to  X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a valid IP  address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You  can  specify the following fallback behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                            Position -> (string)
                               The position in the header to search for the IP
                               address. The header can contain IP addresses of
                               the  original  client  and also of proxies. For
                               example, the header value  could  be  10.1.1.1,
                               127.0.0.0,  10.10.10.10  where the first IP ad-
                               dress identifies the original  client  and  the
                               rest  identify  proxies  that  the request went
                               through.

                               The options for this setting are the following:

                               o FIRST - Inspect the first IP address  in  the
                                 list  of  IP addresses in the header. This is
                                 usually the client's original IP.

                               o LAST - Inspect the last  IP  address  in  the
                                 list of IP addresses in the header.

                               o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the header
                                 for a match. If the header contains more than
                                 10 IP addresses, WAF inspects the last 10.

                     RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for matches with regular  expressions.  To  use  this,
                        create  a   RegexPatternSet that specifies the expres-
                        sions that you want to detect, then  use  the  ARN  of
                        that  set in this statement. A web request matches the
                        pattern set rule statement if  the  request  component
                        matches  any  of  the patterns in the set. To create a
                        regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                        Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  references  a
                        regex pattern set. You create and maintain the set in-
                        dependent of your rules. This allows you  to  use  the
                        single set in multiple rules. When you update the ref-
                        erenced set, WAF automatically updates all rules  that
                        reference it.

                        ARN -> (string)
                            The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the  RegexPat-
                            ternSet that this statement references.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  header. Provide the name of
                               the header to inspect, for example,  User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single query  argument.  Provide  the
                               name  of the query argument to inspect, such as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This  is  used only to indicate the web request
                               component for WAF to inspect,  in  the   Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example  JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": { "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request URI path. This is the  part
                               of  a  web  request that identifies a resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers.  This  is  the  part of a request that
                               contains any additional data that you  want  to
                               send  to  your  web  server as the HTTP request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect the HTTP method. The  method  indicates
                               the  type of operation that the request is ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as JSON.  The  request
                               body  immediately  follows the request headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional  data  that you want to send to your
                               web server as the HTTP request  body,  such  as
                               data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an 8 KB size limit on the body of the  request.
                               WAF  doesn't support inspecting the entire con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The  patterns to look for in the JSON body.
                                   WAF inspects the results of  these  pattern
                                   matches  against the rule inspection crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match all  of  the  elements.  See  also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match only the specified include  paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide  the  include  paths  using JSON
                                      Pointer syntax. For example,  "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the   Internet  Engineering  Task  Force

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You  must specify either this setting or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The  parts of the JSON to match against us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What  WAF  should  do  if  it fails to com-
                                   pletely parse the JSON  body.  The  options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  - Inspect the body as
                                     plain text. WAF applies the  text  trans-
                                     formations  and  inspection criteria that
                                     you defined for the  JSON  inspection  to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the rule statement. WAF applies the  rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request as not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If you  don't  provide  this  setting,  WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the first parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF  does its best to parse the entire JSON
                                   body, but might be forced to stop for  rea-
                                   sons  such as invalid characters, duplicate
                                   keys, truncation,  and  any  content  whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF  parses the JSON in the following exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting that attackers use in web  requests  in
                            an  effort to bypass detection. If you specify one
                            or more transformations in a rule  statement,  WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request component  identified  by  FieldToMatch  ,
                            starting  from the lowest priority setting, before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text transformations eliminate some of the  un-
                               usual  formatting that attackers use in web re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple  transformations that are defined for
                                   a rule statement. WAF processes all  trans-
                                   formations,  from  lowest priority to high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent.  The priorities don't need to be con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You can specify the  following  transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation that ignores  characters  that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness  of attackers who inject an operat-
                                      ing system command-line command and  use
                                      unusual  formatting  to disguise some or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete spaces before the following  char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace  the  following characters with a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE   -  Replace  these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  also replaces mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded  using CSS 2.x escape rules syn-
                                      data.html#characters  .  This   function
                                      uses  up  to  two  bytes in the decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters  that  were encoded using CSS
                                      encoding that wouldnt typically  be  en-
                                      coded.  It's  also  useful in countering
                                      evasion, which is  a  combination  of  a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f  ,
                                      \n  , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \" ,
                                      \xHH (hexadecimal), \0OOO  (octal).  En-
                                      codings  that aren't valid remain in the
                                      output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded characters with unencoded  charac-
                                      ters.  HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces   (ampersand)lt;  with  a  "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces characters that are  represented
                                     in  decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn; ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences.  If a \  u  HHHH code is in the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and adjust the lower byte. If not,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed, causing a possible  loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE  -  Convert  uppercase letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5 - Calculate an  MD5  hash  from  the
                                      data  in the input. The computed hash is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE - Specify NONE if  you  don't  want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH    -    Remove   multiple
                                      slashes, directory self-references,  and
                                      directory  back-references  that are not
                                      at the beginning of the  input  from  an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but  first   converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all  NULL bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS - Replace  each  occur-
                                      rence  of a C-style comment (/* ... */ )
                                      with a single space.  Multiple  consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated comments  are  also  replaced
                                      with  a  space  (ASCII 0x20). However, a
                                      standalone termination of a comment  (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS  -  Replace  NULL bytes in
                                      the input with space  characters  (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode  SQL hex data.
                                      Example (0x414243 ) will be  decoded  to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI  -  Like URL_DECODE , but
                                      with support for  Microsoft-specific  %u
                                      encoding.   If   the   code  is  in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      ,  the higher byte is used to detect and
                                      adjust the lower byte.  Otherwise,  only
                                      the  lower  byte  is used and the higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert  all   UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps input normalization, and  minimiz-
                                      ing  false-positives and false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                     RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                        A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each
                        originating  IP  address, and triggers the rule action
                        when the rate exceeds a limit that you specify on  the
                        number  of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can
                        use this to put a temporary block on requests from  an
                        IP address that is sending excessive requests.

                        WAF  tracks  and  manages  web requests separately for
                        each instance of a rate-based rule that you  use.  For
                        example,  if you provide the same rate-based rule set-
                        tings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements
                        represents  a separate instance of the rate-based rule
                        and gets its own tracking and management  by  WAF.  If
                        you  define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and
                        then use that rule group in multiple places, each  use
                        creates  a  separate  instance  of the rate-based rule
                        that gets its own tracking and management by WAF.

                        When the rule action triggers, WAF  blocks  additional
                        requests  from  the  IP address until the request rate
                        falls below the limit.

                        You can optionally nest another statement  inside  the
                        rate-based  statement, to narrow the scope of the rule
                        so that it only counts requests that match the  nested
                        statement.  For example, based on recent requests that
                        you have seen from an attacker,  you  might  create  a
                        rate-based  rule with a nested AND rule statement that
                        contains the following nested statements:

                        o An IP match statement with an IP set that  specified
                          the address 192.0.2.44.

                        o A  string  match  statement  that  searches  in  the
                          User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                        In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate limit.
                        For  this  example,  the rate limit is 1,000. Requests
                        that meet both of the conditions in the statements are
                        counted.  If the count exceeds 1,000 requests per five
                        minutes, the rule action triggers.  Requests  that  do
                        not  meet  both conditions are not counted towards the
                        rate limit and are not affected by this rule.

                        You cannot nest a  RateBasedStatement  inside  another
                        statement,   for  example  inside  a  NotStatement  or
                        OrStatement . You can define a RateBasedStatement  in-
                        side a web ACL and inside a rule group.

                        Limit -> (long)
                            The  limit  on  requests per 5-minute period for a
                            single originating IP address.  If  the  statement
                            includes  a ScopeDownStatement , this limit is ap-
                            plied only to the requests that match  the  state-
                            ment.

                        AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                            Setting  that  indicates  how to aggregate the re-
                            quest counts. The options are the following:

                            o IP - Aggregate the request counts on the IP  ad-
                              dress from the web request origin.

                            o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request counts on
                              the first IP address in an HTTP header.  If  you
                              use  this,  configure the ForwardedIPConfig , to
                              specify the header to use.

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the  rate-based  statement.  Requests   are   only
                            tracked  by the rate-based statement if they match
                            the scope-down statement. You can use any nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement , with  a   SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement  that  enforces an 8 KB
                                      size limit on the body of  the  request.
                                      WAF  doesn't  support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             tal). Encodings that aren't valid
                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                               conditions. An SQL  injection  match  condition
                               identifies  the  part  of web requests, such as
                               the URI or the query string, that you want  WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate a web ACL, you specify whether to allow  or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying

                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)

                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-

                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the

                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB). If the request body for your web  requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint condition and  block  requests  that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data

                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,

                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The  operator to use to compare the request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The size, in byte, to compare  to  the  re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system
                                             command-line  command and use un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some

                                             COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -   Replace
                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters
                                             that  were  encoded using CSS 2.x
                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             MD5  - Calculate an MD5 hash from
                                             the data in the input.  The  com-
                                             puted  hash  is  in  a raw binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE - Specify NONE if you  don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH  - Remove multiple
                                             slashes,  directory   self-refer-
                                             ences,  and directory back-refer-
                                             ences that are not at the  begin-
                                             ning  of  the input from an input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS  -  Remove  all NULL
                                             bytes from the input.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS  -   Replace   NULL
                                             bytes  in  the  input  with space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             , but  with  support  for  Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E  , the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to identify web  requests
                               based on country of origin.

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An  array  of  two-character country codes,
                                   for example, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the  al-
                                   pha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 in-
                                   ternational standard.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You can only  use  a  rule  group
                               reference  statement  at the top level inside a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement , with  a   SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement  that  enforces an 8 KB
                                      size limit on the body of  the  request.
                                      WAF  doesn't  support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters

                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-
                                             cover  ASCII characters that were
                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,

                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rate-based  rule tracks the rate of requests
                               for each originating IP address,  and  triggers
                               the  rule  action when the rate exceeds a limit
                               that you specify on the number of  requests  in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a temporary block on requests from  an  IP  ad-
                               dress that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional  requests  from the IP address until the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You can optionally nest another  statement  in-
                               side  the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the
                               scope of the rule so that it  only  counts  re-
                               quests that match the nested statement. For ex-
                               ample, based on recent requests that  you  have
                               seen  from  an  attacker,  you  might  create a
                               rate-based rule with a nested AND  rule  state-
                               ment  that contains the following nested state-
                               ments:

                               o An IP match statement with  an  IP  set  that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit.  For  this  example,  the  rate limit is
                               1,000. Requests that meet both  of  the  condi-
                               tions  in  the  statements  are counted. If the
                               count exceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,
                               the  rule action triggers. Requests that do not
                               meet both conditions are  not  counted  towards
                               the  rate  limit  and  are not affected by this
                               rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment or OrStatement . You can  define  a  Rate-
                               BasedStatement  inside  a  web ACL and inside a
                               rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement includes a  ScopeDownStatement  ,
                                   this  limit is applied only to the requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  If  you  use this, configure the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (   ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                               (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule  statements  with  AND  logic. You provide
                               more than one  Statement within  the  AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to combine with AND logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to  combine with OR logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to negate the re-
                               sults of another rule  statement.  You  provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a managed rule group. To  use  this,
                               provide  the  vendor  name  and the name of the
                               rule group in this statement. You can  retrieve
                               the  required names by calling  ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . It can only be  referenced  as  a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space specifications  and  prefix  up  to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)

                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used

                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                        ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                            The  configuration  for inspecting IP addresses in
                            an HTTP header that you specify, instead of  using
                            the  IP address that's reported by the web request
                            origin.  Commonly,  this  is  the  X-Forwarded-For
                            (XFF) header, but you can specify any header name.

                            NOTE:
                               If  the  specified  header isn't present in the
                               request, WAF doesn't apply the rule to the  web
                               request at all.

                            This  is  required  if  AggregateKeyType is set to
                            FORWARDED_IP .

                            HeaderName -> (string)
                               The name of the HTTP header to use for  the  IP
                               address.   For   example,  to  use  the  X-For-
                               warded-For (XFF) header,  set  this  to  X-For-
                               warded-For .

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                            FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                               The  match  status to assign to the web request
                               if the request doesn't have a valid IP  address
                               in the specified position.

                               NOTE:
                                   If  the  specified  header isn't present in
                                   the request, WAF doesn't apply the rule  to
                                   the web request at all.

                               You  can  specify the following fallback behav-
                               iors:

                               o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching the
                                 rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action
                                 to the request.

                               o NO_MATCH -  Treat  the  web  request  as  not
                                 matching the rule statement.

                     AndStatement -> (structure)
                        A  logical  rule  statement used to combine other rule
                        statements with AND logic. You provide more  than  one
                        Statement within the AndStatement .

                        Statements -> (list)
                            The  statements to combine with AND logic. You can
                            use any statements that can be nested.

                            (structure)
                               The processing guidance for a  Rule ,  used  by
                               WAF  to determine whether a web request matches
                               the rule.

                               ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search  for  WAF to apply to web re-
                                   quests. The byte match  statement  provides
                                   the  bytes  to  search for, the location in
                                   requests that you want WAF to  search,  and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically a string  that  corresponds  with
                                   ASCII  characters.  In  the WAF console and
                                   the developer guide, this is refered to  as
                                   a string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A  string  value  that  you  want WAF to
                                      search for. WAF  searches  only  in  the
                                      part  of web requests that you designate
                                      for inspection in   FieldToMatch  .  The
                                      maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                                      Valid  values  depend  on  the component
                                      that  you  specify  for  inspection   in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF to search for. This indicates  the
                                        type of operation specified in the re-
                                        quest.

                                      o UriPath : The value that you want  WAF
                                        to search for in the URI path, for ex-
                                        ample, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      If  SearchString   includes   alphabetic
                                      characters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify a base64-encoded version of  the
                                      value.  The  maximum length of the value
                                      before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                      For example, suppose the value  of  Type
                                      is  HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data is
                                      User-Agent . If you want to  search  the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you  base64-encode  BadBot  using   MIME
                                      base64-encoding  and include the result-
                                      ing value, QmFkQm90 , in  the  value  of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If  you're  using  the CLI or one of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The value that you want  WAF  to  search
                                      for.  The  SDK  automatically base64 en-
                                      codes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The  parts  of  the JSON to match
                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-
                                               spection   to   the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. If you  specify  one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)

                                             statement.  WAF   processes   all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The

                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                      quest that you want WAF  to  search  for
                                      SearchString  . Valid values include the
                                      following:
                                          CONTAINS

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      but the location doesn't matter.
                                          CONTAINS_WORD

                                      The specified part of  the  web  request
                                      must include the value of SearchString ,
                                      and SearchString must contain  only  al-
                                      phanumeric   characters   or  underscore
                                      (A-Z, a-z,  0-9,  or  _).  In  addition,
                                      SearchString must be a word, which means
                                      that both of the following are true:

                                      o SearchString is at  the  beginning  of
                                        the  specified part of the web request
                                        or is preceded by  a  character  other
                                        than  an alphanumeric character or un-
                                        derscore  (_).  Examples  include  the
                                        value of a header and ;BadBot .

                                      o SearchString  is  at  the  end  of the
                                        specified part of the web  request  or
                                        is  followed by a character other than
                                        an alphanumeric  character  or  under-

                                      The value of the specified part  of  the
                                      web request must exactly match the value
                                      of SearchString .
                                          STARTS_WITH

                                      The value of SearchString must appear at
                                      the  beginning  of the specified part of
                                      the web request.
                                          ENDS_WITH

                                      The value of SearchString must appear at
                                      the end of the specified part of the web
                                      request.

                               SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   Attackers sometimes  insert  malicious  SQL
                                   code  into web requests in an effort to ex-

                                   block  web  requests that appear to contain
                                   malicious SQL code, create one or more  SQL
                                   injection  match  conditions. An SQL injec-

                                   web  requests, such as the URI or the query
                                   string, that you want WAF to inspect. Later
                                   in  the process, when you create a web ACL,
                                   you specify whether to allow or  block  re-
                                   quests that appear to contain malicious SQL
                                   code.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-

                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. If you  specify  one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)

                                             statement.  WAF   processes   all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following

                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a

                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as

                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies

                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON body. WAF inspects  the  re-

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-

                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-

                                                 zeroed,  causing  a  possible
                                                 loss of information.

                                                 used and the higher  byte  is
                                                 zeroed.

                                                 UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule statement that compares a number of
                                   bytes against the size of a request  compo-
                                   nent,  using a comparison operator, such as
                                   greater than (>) or less than (<). For  ex-
                                   ample, you can use a size constraint state-
                                   ment to look for  query  strings  that  are
                                   longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body, WAF  inspects  only  the  first  8192
                                   bytes  (8 KB). If the request body for your
                                   web requests never exceeds 8192 bytes,  you
                                   can  create a size constraint condition and
                                   block requests that  have  a  request  body
                                   greater than 8192 bytes.

                                   If  you choose URI for the value of Part of
                                   the request to filter on, the slash (/)  in
                                   the  URI counts as one character. For exam-
                                   ple, the URI /logo.jpg is  nine  characters
                                   long.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-

                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)

                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF inspects the re-

                                                 You  must specify either this

                                                 but not both.

                                                 NOTE:
                                                    Don't  use  this option to

                                                 (string)

                                          MatchScope -> (string)
                                             The parts of the  JSON  to  match
                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use to compare  the  re-
                                      quest part to the size setting.

                                   Size -> (long)
                                      The size, in byte, to compare to the re-
                                      quest part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass  detection.  If  you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-

                                   ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The configuration for inspecting IP  ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify, instead of  using  the  IP  address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are  defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this,
                                   create a rule group with your  rules,  then
                                   provide  the  ARN of the rule group in this
                                   statement.

                                   You cannot nest a  RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment  ,  for  example for use inside a Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You can only use
                                   a rule group reference statement at the top
                                   level inside a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The  rules  in the referenced rule group
                                      whose actions are set to  Count  .  When
                                      you exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it ex-
                                      actly as it would  if  the  rule  action
                                      setting  were  Count  . This is a useful
                                      option for testing the rules in  a  rule
                                      group  without modifying how they handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count . When you  exclude  a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would if  the  rule  action  setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for testing  the  rules  in  a  rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  used  to detect web re-
                                   quests coming from particular IP  addresses
                                   or  address  ranges. To use this, create an
                                   IPSet that specifies the addresses you want
                                   to  detect, then use the ARN of that set in
                                   this statement. To create an  IP  set,  see
                                   CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set. You create and maintain the set  inde-
                                   pendent  of  your rules. This allows you to
                                   use the single set in multiple rules.  When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The  match  status  to assign to the
                                          web request if the  request  doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for the IP address. The  header  can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client and also of proxies. For  ex-
                                          ample,  the  header  value  could be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where  the  first IP address identi-
                                          fies the  original  client  and  the
                                          rest  identify  proxies that the re-
                                          quest went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the
                                          following:

                                          o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP ad-
                                            dress in the list of IP  addresses
                                            in the header. This is usually the
                                            client's original IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses  in
                                            the  header  for  a  match. If the
                                            header contains more  than  10  IP
                                            addresses,  WAF  inspects the last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ->   (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions.  To  use  this,  create a  RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you  want  to  detect,  then use the ARN of
                                   that set in this statement. A  web  request
                                   matches  the  pattern set rule statement if
                                   the request component matches  any  of  the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each regex pattern set rule statement  ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This  allows  you  to use the single set in
                                   multiple rules. When you update the  refer-
                                   enced  set,  WAF  automatically updates all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON body. WAF inspects  the  re-
                                             sults  of  these  pattern matches
                                             against the rule inspection  cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match  all  of  the elements.

                                             The options are the following:

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. If you  specify  one  or

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rate-based  rule  tracks the rate of re-
                                   quests for each originating IP address, and
                                   triggers  the rule action when the rate ex-
                                   ceeds a limit that you specify on the  num-
                                   ber  of requests in any 5-minute time span.
                                   You can use this to put a  temporary  block
                                   on  requests  from  an  IP  address that is
                                   sending excessive requests.

                                   WAF tracks and manages web  requests  sepa-
                                   rately  for  each  instance of a rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide  the  same rate-based rule settings in
                                   two web ACLs, each of the two  rule  state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based rule and gets its  own  tracking
                                   and  management  by  WAF.  If  you define a
                                   rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,  and
                                   then   use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                                   places, each use  creates  a  separate  in-
                                   stance of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                   own tracking and management by WAF.

                                   When the rule action triggers,  WAF  blocks
                                   additional requests from the IP address un-
                                   til the request rate falls below the limit.

                                   You can optionally nest  another  statement
                                   inside  the rate-based statement, to narrow
                                   the scope of  the  rule  so  that  it  only
                                   counts   requests  that  match  the  nested
                                   statement. For example, based on recent re-
                                   quests that you have seen from an attacker,
                                   you might create a rate-based rule  with  a
                                   nested AND rule statement that contains the
                                   following nested statements:

                                   o An IP match statement with an IP set that
                                     specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                   o A string match statement that searches in
                                     the User-Agent header for the string Bad-

                                   In  this rate-based rule, you also define a
                                   rate limit.  For  this  example,  the  rate
                                   limit  is 1,000. Requests that meet both of
                                   the  conditions  in  the   statements   are
                                   counted.  If  the  count  exceeds 1,000 re-
                                   quests per five minutes,  the  rule  action
                                   triggers.  Requests  that  do not meet both
                                   conditions are not counted towards the rate
                                   limit and are not affected by this rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another statement,  for  example  inside  a
                                   NotStatement  or  OrStatement . You can de-
                                   fine a RateBasedStatement inside a web  ACL
                                   and inside a rule group.

                                   Limit -> (long)
                                      The  limit  on requests per 5-minute pe-
                                      riod for a  single  originating  IP  ad-
                                      dress.   If  the  statement  includes  a
                                      ScopeDownStatement , this limit  is  ap-
                                      plied  only  to  the requests that match
                                      the statement.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting that indicates how to  aggregate
                                      the  request counts. The options are the
                                      following:

                                      o IP - Aggregate the request  counts  on
                                        the  IP  address  from the web request
                                        origin.

                                      o FORWARDED_IP - Aggregate  the  request
                                        counts  on  the first IP address in an
                                        HTTP header. If you use this,  config-
                                        ure the ForwardedIPConfig , to specify
                                        the header to use.

                                   ( ... recursive ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The  configuration for inspecting IP ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify,  instead  of  using  the IP address
                                      that's reported by the web request  ori-
                                      gin.   Commonly,   this  is  the  X-For-
                                      warded-For (XFF)  header,  but  you  can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This is required if AggregateKeyType  is
                                      set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                               AndStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement  used  to  combine
                                   other  rule  statements with AND logic. You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   AndStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The   statements  to  combine  with  AND
                                      logic. You can use any  statements  that
                                      can be nested.

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                               OrStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  logical  rule  statement used to combine
                                   other rule statements with  OR  logic.  You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   OrStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The statements to combine with OR logic.
                                      You  can  use any statements that can be
                                      nested.

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                               NotStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement used to negate the
                                   results of another rule statement. You pro-
                                   vide one  Statement within the NotStatement
                                   .

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                               ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this,  provide the vendor name and the name
                                   of the rule group in  this  statement.  You
                                   can  retrieve the required names by calling
                                   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                                   You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement
                                   , for example for use inside a NotStatement
                                   or OrStatement . It can only be  referenced
                                   as a top-level statement within a rule.

                                   VendorName -> (string)
                                      The  name of the managed rule group ven-
                                      dor. You use this, along with  the  rule
                                      group name, to identify the rule group.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The  name of the managed rule group. You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)
                                      The version of the managed rule group to
                                      use. If you specify  this,  the  version
                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you don't specify  this,  WAF  uses  the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The rules in the referenced  rule  group
                                      whose  actions  are  set to Count . When
                                      you exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it ex-
                                      actly  as  it  would  if the rule action
                                      setting were Count . This  is  a  useful
                                      option  for  testing the rules in a rule
                                      group without modifying how they  handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride  to  Count . When you exclude a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would  if  the  rule  action setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for  testing  the  rules  in  a rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  rule  statement  that  defines  a string
                                   match search against labels that have  been
                                   added to the web request by rules that have
                                   already run in the web ACL.

                                   The label match statement provides the  la-
                                   bel  or namespace string to search for. The
                                   label string can represent a part or all of
                                   the  fully  qualified  label  name that had
                                   been added to the web request. Fully quali-
                                   fied  labels  have a prefix, optional name-
                                   spaces, and label name. The prefix  identi-
                                   fies  the  rule group or web ACL context of
                                   the rule that added the label.  If  you  do
                                   not  provide  the  fully  qualified name in
                                   your label match string, WAF  performs  the
                                   search  for  labels  that were added in the
                                   same context as the label match statement.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify whether you want to match  using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you provide  for  this  depends  on  the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates LABEL , then
                                        this specification  must  include  the
                                        name  and  can  include  any number of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE  ,
                                        then  this  specification  can include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings,  and  can  include the entire
                                        label namespace prefix from  the  rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of  a  label must be separated by colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components  for  a  match  against a single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The string representing the regular  ex-
                                      pression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass  detection.  If  you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-

                                             that  are  defined  for  a   rule
                                             statement.   WAF   processes  all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing the transformed content.  The
                                             priorities  don't need to be con-
                                             secutive, but they  must  all  be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE  -   Decode   a
                                                 Base64 -encoded string.

                                                 BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a
                                                 Base64 -encoded  string,  but
                                                 use  a  forgiving implementa-
                                                 tion that ignores  characters
                                                 that aren't valid.

                                                 CMD_LINE    -    Command-line
                                                 transformations.  These   are
                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                   A  rule  statement  that  defines  a string
                                   match search for WAF to apply  to  web  re-
                                   quests.  The  byte match statement provides
                                   the bytes to search for,  the  location  in
                                   requests  that  you want WAF to search, and
                                   other settings. The bytes to search for are
                                   typically  a  string  that corresponds with
                                   ASCII characters. In the  WAF  console  and
                                   the  developer guide, this is refered to as
                                   a string match statement.

                                   SearchString -> (blob)
                                      A string value  that  you  want  WAF  to
                                      search  for.  WAF  searches  only in the
                                      part of web requests that you  designate
                                      for  inspection  in   FieldToMatch . The
                                      maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.

                                      Valid values  depend  on  the  component
                                      that   you  specify  for  inspection  in
                                      FieldToMatch :

                                      o Method : The HTTP method that you want
                                        WAF  to search for. This indicates the
                                        type of operation specified in the re-
                                        quest.

                                      o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF
                                        to search for in the URI path, for ex-
                                        ample, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      If   SearchString   includes  alphabetic
                                      characters A-Z and a-z,  note  that  the
                                      value is case sensitive.
                                          If you're using the WAF API

                                      Specify  a base64-encoded version of the
                                      value. The maximum length of  the  value
                                      before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                      For  example,  suppose the value of Type
                                      is HEADER  and  the  value  of  Data  is
                                      User-Agent  .  If you want to search the
                                      User-Agent header for the value BadBot ,
                                      you   base64-encode  BadBot  using  MIME
                                      base64-encoding and include the  result-
                                      ing  value,  QmFkQm90  , in the value of
                                      SearchString .
                                          If you're using the CLI  or  one  of
                                          the Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                      The  value  that  you want WAF to search
                                      for. The SDK  automatically  base64  en-
                                      codes the value.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The patterns to look for  in  the
                                             JSON  body.  WAF inspects the re-
                                             sults of  these  pattern  matches
                                             against  the rule inspection cri-
                                             teria.

                                             All -> (structure)
                                                 Match all  of  the  elements.

                                                 You must specify either  this

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass  detection.  If  you specify one or

                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                               SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   Attackers  sometimes  insert  malicious SQL
                                   code into web requests in an effort to  ex-
                                   tract  data from your database. To allow or
                                   block web requests that appear  to  contain
                                   malicious  SQL code, create one or more SQL
                                   injection match conditions. An  SQL  injec-
                                   tion match condition identifies the part of
                                   web requests, such as the URI or the  query
                                   string, that you want WAF to inspect. Later
                                   in the process, when you create a web  ACL,
                                   you  specify  whether to allow or block re-
                                   quests that appear to contain malicious SQL
                                   code.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the

                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-

                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-

                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass  detection.  If  you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets the relative processing  or-
                                             der  for multiple transformations
                                             that  are  defined  for  a   rule
                                             statement.   WAF   processes  all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing the transformed content.  The
                                             priorities  don't need to be con-
                                             secutive, but they  must  all  be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)
                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE  -   Decode   a
                                                 Base64 -encoded string.

                                                 BASE64_DECODE_EXT  - Decode a
                                                 Base64 -encoded  string,  but
                                                 use  a  forgiving implementa-
                                                 tion that ignores  characters
                                                 that aren't valid.

                                                 CMD_LINE    -    Command-line
                                                 transformations.  These   are
                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                                 data.html#characters  .  This
                                                 function uses up to two bytes
                                                 in  the  decoding process, so
                                                 it can help to uncover  ASCII
                                                 characters  that were encoded
                                                 using   CSS   encoding   that
                                                 wouldnt typically be encoded.
                                                 It's also useful in  counter-

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8

                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a

                                             against  using the MatchPattern .
                                             If you specify All , WAF  matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies  the text transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you  defined  for  the JSON in-
                                               spection  to  the   body   text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-
                                               quest  as not matching the rule
                                               statement.

                                             If you don't  provide  this  set-
                                             ting,  WAF  parses  and evaluates
                                             the content only up to the  first
                                             parsing  failure  that it encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF does its best  to  parse  the
                                             entire  JSON  body,  but might be
                                             forced to stop for  reasons  such
                                             as  invalid characters, duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose  root  node isn't an object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF parses the JSON in  the  fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass  detection.  If  you specify one or
                                      more transformations in  a  rule  state-
                                      ment,  WAF  performs all transformations
                                      on the content of the request  component
                                      identified  by  FieldToMatch  , starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                          Text  transformations eliminate some
                                          of the unusual formatting  that  at-
                                          tackers  use  in  web requests in an

                                             statement.   WAF   processes  all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing the transformed content.  The

                                                 adjust the lower byte. Other-
                                                 wise, only the lower byte  is
                                                 used  and  the higher byte is
                                                 zeroed.

                                                 UTF8_TO_UNICODE - Convert all

                               SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement that compares a number  of
                                   bytes  against the size of a request compo-
                                   nent, using a comparison operator, such  as
                                   greater  than (>) or less than (<). For ex-
                                   ample, you can use a size constraint state-
                                   ment  to  look  for  query strings that are
                                   longer than 100 bytes.

                                   If you configure WAF to inspect the request
                                   body,  WAF  inspects  only  the  first 8192
                                   bytes (8 KB). If the request body for  your
                                   web  requests never exceeds 8192 bytes, you
                                   can create a size constraint condition  and
                                   block  requests  that  have  a request body
                                   greater than 8192 bytes.

                                   If you choose URI for the value of Part  of
                                   the  request to filter on, the slash (/) in
                                   the URI counts as one character. For  exam-
                                   ple,  the  URI /logo.jpg is nine characters
                                   long.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON body. WAF inspects  the  re-

                                          MatchScope -> (string)

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule

                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-

                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:
                                               {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The  operator  to use to compare the re-
                                      quest part to the size setting.

                                   Size -> (long)
                                      The size, in byte, to compare to the re-
                                      quest part, after any transformations.

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. If you  specify  one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)

                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                          Type -> (string)

                                                 transformations.   These  are
                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present   in   the  request,  WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                               RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a  RuleGroup . To use  this,
                                   create  a  rule group with your rules, then
                                   provide the ARN of the rule group  in  this
                                   statement.

                                   You  cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceState-
                                   ment , for example for use  inside  a  Not-
                                   Statement or OrStatement . You can only use
                                   a rule group reference statement at the top
                                   level inside a web ACL.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      entity.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The rules in the referenced  rule  group
                                      whose  actions  are  set to Count . When
                                      you exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it ex-
                                      actly  as  it  would  if the rule action
                                      setting were Count . This  is  a  useful
                                      option  for  testing the rules in a rule
                                      group without modifying how they  handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies  a  single  rule in a rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride  to  Count . When you exclude a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would  if  the  rule  action setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for  testing  the  rules  in  a rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used  to  detect  web  re-
                                   quests  coming from particular IP addresses
                                   or address ranges. To use this,  create  an
                                   IPSet that specifies the addresses you want
                                   to detect, then use the ARN of that set  in
                                   this  statement.  To  create an IP set, see
                                   CreateIPSet .

                                   Each IP set rule statement references an IP
                                   set.  You create and maintain the set inde-
                                   pendent of your rules. This allows  you  to
                                   use  the single set in multiple rules. When
                                   you update the referenced set, WAF automat-
                                   ically updates all rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      IPSet that this statement references.

                                   IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                      The configuration for inspecting IP  ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify, instead of  using  the  IP  address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The  name  of the HTTP header to use
                                          for the IP address. For example,  to
                                          use    the   X-Forwarded-For   (XFF)
                                          header, set this to  X-Forwarded-For
                                          .

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                      FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          The match status to  assign  to  the
                                          web  request  if the request doesn't
                                          have a valid IP address in the spec-
                                          ified position.

                                          NOTE:
                                             If  the  specified  header  isn't
                                             present  in  the   request,   WAF
                                             doesn't apply the rule to the web
                                             request at all.

                                          You can specify the following  fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          The position in the header to search
                                          for  the  IP address. The header can
                                          contain IP addresses of the original
                                          client  and also of proxies. For ex-
                                          ample, the  header  value  could  be
                                          10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,   10.10.10.10
                                          where the first IP  address  identi-
                                          fies  the  original  client  and the
                                          rest identify proxies that  the  re-
                                          quest went through.

                                          The options for this setting are the
                                          following:

                                          o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  ad-
                                            dress  in the list of IP addresses
                                            in the header. This is usually the
                                            client's original IP.

                                          o LAST - Inspect the last IP address
                                            in the list of IP addresses in the
                                            header.

                                          o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in
                                            the header for  a  match.  If  the
                                            header  contains  more  than 10 IP
                                            addresses, WAF inspects  the  last
                                            10.

                               RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement   ->  (struc-
                               ture)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for matches with regular expres-
                                   sions. To use  this,  create  a   RegexPat-
                                   ternSet that specifies the expressions that
                                   you want to detect, then  use  the  ARN  of
                                   that  set  in this statement. A web request
                                   matches the pattern set rule  statement  if
                                   the  request  component  matches any of the
                                   patterns in the set. To create a regex pat-
                                   tern set, see  CreateRegexPatternSet .

                                   Each  regex pattern set rule statement ref-
                                   erences a regex pattern set. You create and
                                   maintain the set independent of your rules.
                                   This allows you to use the  single  set  in
                                   multiple  rules. When you update the refer-
                                   enced set, WAF  automatically  updates  all
                                   rules that reference it.

                                   ARN -> (string)
                                      The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the
                                      RegexPatternSet that this statement ref-
                                      erences.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The  part of a web request that you want
                                      WAF to inspect.  For  more  information,

                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name of the header to  inspect,  for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example  JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The  name  of the query header to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide  the name of the query argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion  . The name can be up to
                                          30 characters long  and  isn't  case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This  is  used  only to indicate the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request URI  path.  This
                                          is  the  part  of a web request that
                                          identifies a resource, for  example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  query  string. This is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as plain
                                          text. The request  body  immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the part of a request that  contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement ,  with  a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-
                                          tents  of  web requests whose bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the HTTP method. The  method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the request is asking the origin  to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request  body as JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the  request  headers.  This  is the
                                          part of a request that contains  any
                                          additional  data  that  you  want to
                                          send to your web server as the  HTTP
                                          request  body,  such  as data from a
                                          form.

                                          Note that only the first 8 KB  (8192
                                          bytes)  of the request body are for-
                                          warded to WAF for inspection by  the
                                          underlying   host  service.  If  you
                                          don't need to inspect  more  than  8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing  a  statement  that inspects the
                                          body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                          forces an 8 KB  size  limit  on  the
                                          body  of  the  request.  WAF doesn't
                                          support inspecting the  entire  con-

                                             IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                                 Match only the specified  in-

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)

                                             completely parse the  JSON  body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING   -  Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-

                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF  applies the rule action to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH - Treat  the  web  re-

                                                 used and the higher  byte  is
                                                 zeroed,  causing  a  possible
                                                 loss of information.

                               RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rate-based rule tracks the  rate  of  re-
                                   quests for each originating IP address, and
                                   triggers the rule action when the rate  ex-
                                   ceeds  a limit that you specify on the num-
                                   ber of requests in any 5-minute time  span.
                                   You  can  use this to put a temporary block
                                   on requests from  an  IP  address  that  is
                                   sending excessive requests.

                                   WAF  tracks  and manages web requests sepa-
                                   rately for each instance  of  a  rate-based
                                   rule that you use. For example, if you pro-
                                   vide the same rate-based rule  settings  in
                                   two  web  ACLs, each of the two rule state-
                                   ments represents a separate instance of the
                                   rate-based  rule  and gets its own tracking
                                   and management by  WAF.  If  you  define  a
                                   rate-based  rule  inside  a rule group, and
                                   then  use  that  rule  group  in   multiple
                                   places,  each  use  creates  a separate in-
                                   stance of the rate-based rule that gets its
                                   own tracking and management by WAF.

                                   When  the  rule action triggers, WAF blocks
                                   additional requests from the IP address un-
                                   til the request rate falls below the limit.

                                   You  can  optionally nest another statement
                                   inside the rate-based statement, to  narrow
                                   the  scope  of  the  rule  so  that it only
                                   counts  requests  that  match  the   nested
                                   statement. For example, based on recent re-
                                   quests that you have seen from an attacker,
                                   you  might  create a rate-based rule with a
                                   nested AND rule statement that contains the
                                   following nested statements:

                                   o An IP match statement with an IP set that
                                     specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                                   o A string match statement that searches in
                                     the User-Agent header for the string Bad-
                                     Bot.

                                   In this rate-based rule, you also define  a
                                   rate  limit.  For  this  example,  the rate
                                   limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both  of
                                   the   conditions   in  the  statements  are
                                   counted. If the  count  exceeds  1,000  re-
                                   quests  per  five  minutes, the rule action
                                   triggers. Requests that do  not  meet  both
                                   conditions are not counted towards the rate
                                   limit and are not affected by this rule.

                                   You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside
                                   another  statement,  for  example  inside a
                                   NotStatement or OrStatement . You  can  de-
                                   fine  a RateBasedStatement inside a web ACL
                                   and inside a rule group.

                                   Limit -> (long)
                                      The limit on requests per  5-minute  pe-
                                      riod  for  a  single  originating IP ad-
                                      dress.  If  the  statement  includes   a
                                      ScopeDownStatement  ,  this limit is ap-
                                      plied only to the  requests  that  match
                                      the statement.

                                   AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                      Setting  that indicates how to aggregate
                                      the request counts. The options are  the
                                      following:

                                      o IP  -  Aggregate the request counts on
                                        the IP address from  the  web  request
                                        origin.

                                      o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate the request
                                        counts on the first IP address  in  an
                                        HTTP  header. If you use this, config-
                                        ure the ForwardedIPConfig , to specify
                                        the header to use.

                                   (  ...  recursive ... )ForwardedIPConfig ->
                                   (structure)
                                      The configuration for inspecting IP  ad-
                                      dresses in an HTTP header that you spec-
                                      ify, instead of  using  the  IP  address
                                      that's  reported by the web request ori-
                                      gin.  Commonly,  this  is   the   X-For-
                                      warded-For  (XFF)  header,  but  you can
                                      specify any header name.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      This  is required if AggregateKeyType is
                                      set to FORWARDED_IP .

                                      HeaderName -> (string)
                                          The name of the HTTP header  to  use
                                          for  the IP address. For example, to
                                          use   the   X-Forwarded-For    (XFF)
                                          header,  set this to X-Forwarded-For

                                          You  can specify the following fall-
                                          back behaviors:

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-

                               AndStatement -> (structure)
                                   A  logical  rule  statement used to combine
                                   other rule statements with AND  logic.  You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the
                                   AndStatement .

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The  statements  to  combine  with   AND
                                      logic.  You  can use any statements that
                                      can be nested.

                                      ( ... recursive ... )

                               OrStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement  used  to  combine
                                   other  rule  statements  with OR logic. You
                                   provide more than one  Statement within the

                                   Statements -> (list)
                                      The statements to combine with OR logic.
                                      You can use any statements that  can  be
                                      nested.

                               NotStatement -> (structure)
                                   A logical rule statement used to negate the
                                   results of another rule statement. You pro-
                                   vide one  Statement within the NotStatement
                                   .

                               ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to run the rules that
                                   are defined in a managed rule group. To use
                                   this, provide the vendor name and the  name
                                   of  the  rule  group in this statement. You
                                   can retrieve the required names by  calling
                                   ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                                   You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement
                                   , for example for use inside a NotStatement
                                   or  OrStatement . It can only be referenced
                                   as a top-level statement within a rule.

                                   VendorName -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group  ven-
                                      dor.  You  use this, along with the rule
                                      group name, to identify the rule group.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name of the managed rule group.  You
                                      use this, along with the vendor name, to
                                      identify the rule group.

                                   Version -> (string)
                                      The version of the managed rule group to
                                      use.  If  you  specify this, the version
                                      setting is fixed until you change it. If
                                      you  don't  specify  this,  WAF uses the
                                      vendor's default version, and then keeps
                                      the version at the vendor's default when
                                      the  vendor  updates  the  managed  rule
                                      group settings.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      The  rules  in the referenced rule group
                                      whose actions are set to  Count  .  When
                                      you exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it ex-
                                      actly as it would  if  the  rule  action
                                      setting  were  Count  . This is a useful
                                      option for testing the rules in  a  rule
                                      group  without modifying how they handle
                                      your web traffic.

                                      (structure)
                                          Specifies a single rule  in  a  rule
                                          group whose action you want to over-
                                          ride to Count . When you  exclude  a
                                          rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                                          would if  the  rule  action  setting
                                          were Count . This is a useful option
                                          for testing  the  rules  in  a  rule
                                          group  without  modifying  how  they
                                          handle your web traffic.

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the rule whose action
                                             you want to override to Count .

                               LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule  statement  that  defines  a  string
                                   match  search against labels that have been
                                   added to the web request by rules that have
                                   already run in the web ACL.

                                   The  label match statement provides the la-
                                   bel or namespace string to search for.  The
                                   label string can represent a part or all of
                                   the fully qualified  label  name  that  had
                                   been added to the web request. Fully quali-
                                   fied labels have a prefix,  optional  name-
                                   spaces,  and label name. The prefix identi-
                                   fies the rule group or web ACL  context  of
                                   the  rule  that  added the label. If you do
                                   not provide the  fully  qualified  name  in
                                   your  label  match string, WAF performs the
                                   search for labels that were  added  in  the
                                   same context as the label match statement.

                                   Scope -> (string)
                                      Specify  whether you want to match using
                                      the label name or just the namespace.

                                   Key -> (string)
                                      The string to match against. The setting
                                      you  provide  for  this  depends  on the
                                      match statement's Scope setting:

                                      o If the Scope indicates  LABEL  ,  then
                                        this  specification  must  include the
                                        name and can  include  any  number  of
                                        preceding namespace specifications and
                                        prefix up to providing the fully qual-
                                        ified label name.

                                      o If  the  Scope  indicates  NAMESPACE ,
                                        then this  specification  can  include
                                        any  number  of  contiguous  namespace
                                        strings, and can  include  the  entire
                                        label  namespace  prefix from the rule
                                        group or web ACL where the label orig-
                                        inates.

                                      Labels are case sensitive and components
                                      of a label must be separated  by  colon,
                                      for example NS1:NS2:name .

                               RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                                   A rule statement used to search web request
                                   components for a  match  against  a  single
                                   regular expression.

                                   RegexString -> (string)
                                      The  string representing the regular ex-
                                      pression.

                                   FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                      The part of a web request that you  want
                                      WAF  to  inspect.  For more information,
                                      see  FieldToMatch .

                                      SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                          Inspect a single header. Provide the
                                          name  of  the header to inspect, for
                                          example,  User-Agent  or  Referer  .
                                          This setting isn't case sensitive.

                                          Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":  {
                                          "Name": "haystack" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query  header  to
                                             inspect.

                                      SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  a  single  query  argument.
                                          Provide the name of the query  argu-
                                          ment to inspect, such as UserName or
                                          SalesRegion . The name can be up  to
                                          30  characters  long  and isn't case
                                          sensitive.

                                          This is used only  to  indicate  the
                                          web request component for WAF to in-
                                          spect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                                          cation.

                                          Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument":
                                          { "Name": "myArgument" }

                                          Name -> (string)
                                             The name of the query argument to
                                             inspect.

                                      AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                          Inspect all query arguments.

                                      UriPath -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the  request URI path. This
                                          is the part of a  web  request  that
                                          identifies  a resource, for example,
                                          /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                      QueryString -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the query  string.  This  is
                                          the part of a URL that appears after
                                          a ? character, if any.

                                      Body -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  plain
                                          text.  The  request body immediately
                                          follows the request headers. This is
                                          the  part of a request that contains
                                          any additional data that you want to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      Method -> (structure)
                                          Inspect  the HTTP method. The method
                                          indicates the type of operation that
                                          the  request is asking the origin to
                                          perform.

                                      JsonBody -> (structure)
                                          Inspect the request  body  as  JSON.
                                          The request body immediately follows
                                          the request  headers.  This  is  the
                                          part  of a request that contains any
                                          additional data  that  you  want  to
                                          send  to your web server as the HTTP
                                          request body, such as  data  from  a
                                          form.

                                          Note  that only the first 8 KB (8192
                                          bytes) of the request body are  for-
                                          warded  to WAF for inspection by the
                                          underlying  host  service.  If   you
                                          don't  need  to  inspect more than 8
                                          KB, you can guarantee that you don't
                                          allow additional bytes in by combin-
                                          ing a statement  that  inspects  the
                                          body  of  the  web  request, such as
                                          ByteMatchStatement   or    RegexPat-
                                          ternSetReferenceStatement  ,  with a
                                          SizeConstraintStatement   that   en-
                                          forces  an  8  KB  size limit on the
                                          body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                                          support  inspecting  the entire con-
                                          tents of web requests  whose  bodies
                                          exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                          MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                             The  patterns  to look for in the
                                             JSON body. WAF inspects  the  re-

                                             against using the MatchPattern  .
                                             If  you specify All , WAF matches
                                             against keys and values.

                                          InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                             What WAF should do if it fails to
                                             completely  parse  the JSON body.
                                             The options are the following:

                                             o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -   Inspect
                                               the body as plain text. WAF ap-
                                               plies the text  transformations
                                               and  inspection  criteria  that
                                               you defined for  the  JSON  in-
                                               spection   to   the  body  text
                                               string.

                                             o MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                               as matching the rule statement.
                                               WAF applies the rule action  to
                                               the request.

                                             o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web re-
                                               quest as not matching the  rule
                                               statement.

                                             If  you  don't  provide this set-
                                             ting, WAF  parses  and  evaluates
                                             the  content only up to the first
                                             parsing failure that  it  encoun-
                                             ters.

                                             WAF  does  its  best to parse the
                                             entire JSON body,  but  might  be
                                             forced  to  stop for reasons such
                                             as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                             keys, truncation, and any content
                                             whose root node isn't  an  object
                                             or an array.

                                             WAF  parses  the JSON in the fol-
                                             lowing examples as two valid key,
                                             value pairs:

                                             o Missing                  comma:
                                               {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                             o Missing                  colon:
                                               {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                             o Extra                   colons:

                                   TextTransformations -> (list)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection. If you  specify  one  or
                                      more  transformations  in  a rule state-
                                      ment, WAF performs  all  transformations
                                      on  the content of the request component
                                      identified by  FieldToMatch  ,  starting
                                      from the lowest priority setting, before
                                      inspecting the content for a match.

                                      (structure)
                                          Text transformations eliminate  some
                                          of  the  unusual formatting that at-
                                          tackers use in web  requests  in  an
                                          effort to bypass detection.

                                          Priority -> (integer)
                                             Sets  the relative processing or-
                                             der for multiple  transformations
                                             that   are  defined  for  a  rule
                                             statement.  WAF   processes   all
                                             transformations, from lowest pri-
                                             ority to highest, before inspect-
                                             ing  the transformed content. The
                                             priorities don't need to be  con-
                                             secutive,  but  they  must all be
                                             different.

                                             You  can  specify  the  following
                                             transformation types:
                                                 BASE64_DECODE   -   Decode  a

                                                 use a  forgiving  implementa-
                                                 tion  that ignores characters
                                                 that aren't valid.

                                                 helpful  in  reducing  effec-

                     NotStatement -> (structure)
                        A logical rule statement used to negate the results of
                        another rule statement.  You  provide  one   Statement
                        within the NotStatement .

                        Statement -> (structure)
                            The statement to negate. You can use any statement
                            that can be nested.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  for  WAF  to apply to web requests. The
                               byte match  statement  provides  the  bytes  to
                               search  for,  the location in requests that you
                               want WAF to search,  and  other  settings.  The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds with ASCII characters. In  the  WAF
                               console  and  the developer guide, this is ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A string value that you want WAF to  search
                                   for.  WAF  searches only in the part of web
                                   requests that you designate for  inspection
                                   in   FieldToMatch  .  The maximum length of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid values depend on the  component  that
                                   you  specify for inspection in FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method : The HTTP method  that  you  want
                                     WAF  to  search  for.  This indicates the
                                     type of operation specified  in  the  re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath  : The value that you want WAF to
                                     search for in the URI path, for  example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters A-Z and a-z, note that  the  value  is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify  a  base64-encoded  version  of the
                                   value. The maximum length of the value  be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For  example,  suppose the value of Type is
                                   HEADER and the value of Data is  User-Agent
                                   .  If  you  want  to  search the User-Agent
                                   header  for  the   value   BadBot   ,   you
                                   base64-encode  BadBot using MIME base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If  you're  using  the CLI or one of the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The value that you want WAF to search  for.
                                   The  SDK  automatically  base64 encodes the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":

                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)

                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for

                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             code range of  FF01-FF5E  ,  then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                   SearchString .  Valid  values  include  the
                                   following:
                                      CONTAINS

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The  specified part of the web request must
                                   include the value  of  SearchString  ,  and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric

                                   _).  In  addition,  SearchString  must be a
                                   word, which means that both of the  follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString  is  at the beginning of the

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers sometimes insert malicious  SQL  code
                               into  web requests in an effort to extract data
                               from your database. To allow or block  web  re-
                               quests  that  appear  to  contain malicious SQL
                               code, create one or more  SQL  injection  match
                               conditions.  An  SQL  injection match condition
                               identifies the part of web  requests,  such  as
                               the  URI or the query string, that you want WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate  a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-
                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \
                                            " ' ^

                                          o Delete spaces before the following

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             CSS_DECODE  -  Decode  characters

                                             escape rules syndata.html#charac-
                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-
                                             cover  ASCII characters that were
                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             tal). Encodings that aren't valid
                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase
                                             letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                             MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash  from
                                             the  data  in the input. The com-
                                             puted hash is  in  a  raw  binary
                                             form.

                                             NONE  - Specify NONE if you don't
                                             want any text transformations.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH - Remove  multiple
                                             slashes,   directory  self-refer-
                                             ences, and directory  back-refer-

                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each
                                             occurrence of a  C-style  comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple consecutive  occurrences
                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             REPLACE_NULLS   -   Replace  NULL
                                             bytes in  the  input  with  space
                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE  -  Decode SQL hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,  but  with  support  for Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion,  and minimizing false-posi-
                                             tives  and  false-negatives   for
                                             non-English languages.

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  defines  a cross-site
                               scripting (XSS) match search for WAF  to  apply
                               to  web  requests.  XSS attacks are those where
                               the attacker uses vulnerabilities in  a  benign
                               website   as  a  vehicle  to  inject  malicious
                               client-site scripts into other  legitimate  web
                               browsers.  The XSS match statement provides the
                               location in  requests  that  you  want  WAF  to
                               search  and  text transformations to use on the
                               search area before WAF searches  for  character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192

                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-

                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores  characters   that   aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers

                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-

                                             REPLACE_COMMENTS -  Replace  each
                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                             standalone  termination of a com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             characters (ASCII 0x20 ).

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             , but  with  support  for  Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E  , the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all
                                             UTF-8 character sequences to Uni-
                                             code. This helps input normaliza-
                                             tion, and minimizing  false-posi-
                                             tives   and  false-negatives  for
                                             non-English languages.

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement  that  compares  a  number  of
                               bytes  against the size of a request component,
                               using a comparison operator,  such  as  greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use a size constraint  statement  to  look  for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If  you  configure  WAF  to inspect the request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB).  If the request body for your web requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint  condition  and  block requests that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If you choose URI for the value of Part of  the
                               request  to filter on, the slash (/) in the URI
                               counts as one character. For example,  the  URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the

                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying

                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The operator to use to compare the  request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The  size,  in  byte, to compare to the re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a

                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule group with your rules,  then  provide  the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  You  can  only use a rule group
                               reference statement at the top level  inside  a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to  detect  web  requests
                               coming  from particular IP addresses or address
                               ranges. To use  this,  create  an   IPSet  that
                               specifies  the  addresses  you  want to detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each  IP  set  rule  statement references an IP
                               set. You create and maintain the  set  indepen-
                               dent  of your rules. This allows you to use the
                               single set in multiple rules. When  you  update
                               the  referenced  set, WAF automatically updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the  IP  address. The header can contain
                                      IP addresses of the original client  and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value  could  be  10.1.1.1,   127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10  where  the first IP address
                                      identifies the original client  and  the
                                      rest  identify  proxies that the request
                                      went through.

                                      The options for  this  setting  are  the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST  -  Inspect the first IP address
                                        in the list of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.  This  is usually the client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST - Inspect the last IP address  in
                                        the   list  of  IP  addresses  in  the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY - Inspect all IP addresses in  the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains more than 10 IP  addresses,  WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for  matches  with  regular  expres-
                               sions.  To  use this, create a  RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect,  then  use  the ARN of that set in this
                               statement. A web request  matches  the  pattern
                               set  rule  statement  if  the request component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate  a  regex pattern set, see  CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each regex pattern set  rule  statement  refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain the set independent of  your  rules.  This
                               allows  you  to  use the single set in multiple
                               rules. When you update the referenced set,  WAF
                               automatically  updates all rules that reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)

                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-

                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-

                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A rate-based rule tracks the rate  of  requests
                               for  each  originating IP address, and triggers
                               the rule action when the rate exceeds  a  limit
                               that  you  specify on the number of requests in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a  temporary  block  on requests from an IP ad-
                               dress that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF tracks and manages web requests  separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use. For  example,  if  you  provide  the  same
                               rate-based  rule settings in two web ACLs, each
                               of the two rule statements represents  a  sepa-
                               rate  instance  of the rate-based rule and gets
                               its own tracking and management by WAF. If  you
                               define  a  rate-based rule inside a rule group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the rate-based rule that gets its own  tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional requests from the IP address  until  the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You  can  optionally nest another statement in-
                               side the rate-based statement,  to  narrow  the
                               scope  of  the  rule so that it only counts re-
                               quests that match the nested statement. For ex-
                               ample,  based  on recent requests that you have
                               seen from  an  attacker,  you  might  create  a
                               rate-based  rule  with a nested AND rule state-
                               ment that contains the following nested  state-
                               ments:

                               o An  IP  match  statement  with an IP set that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit. For this  example,  the  rate  limit  is
                               1,000.  Requests  that  meet both of the condi-
                               tions in the statements  are  counted.  If  the
                               count  exceeds 1,000 requests per five minutes,
                               the rule action triggers. Requests that do  not
                               meet  both  conditions  are not counted towards
                               the rate limit and are  not  affected  by  this
                               rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment  or  OrStatement  . You can define a Rate-
                               BasedStatement inside a web ACL  and  inside  a
                               rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The  limit  on requests per 5-minute period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement  includes  a ScopeDownStatement ,
                                   this limit is applied only to the  requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP  - Aggregate the request counts on the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP  -  Aggregate  the   request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header. If you use  this,  configure  the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (  ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig   ->
                               (structure)
                                   The  configuration  for  inspecting  IP ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead  of using the IP address that's re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this  is  the X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the  request, WAF doesn't apply the rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with  AND  logic.  You  provide
                               more  than  one  Statement within the AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine with  AND  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The statements to combine  with  OR  logic.
                                   You  can  use  any  statements  that can be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to negate the re-
                               sults  of  another  rule statement. You provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined  in  a managed rule group. To use this,
                               provide the vendor name and  the  name  of  the
                               rule  group in this statement. You can retrieve
                               the required names by calling   ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You  cannot  nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement ,
                               for example for use inside  a  NotStatement  or
                               OrStatement  .  It  can only be referenced as a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group  vendor.
                                   You  use  this,  along  with the rule group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this,  along with the vendor name, to iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The version of the managed  rule  group  to
                                   use.  If you specify this, the version set-
                                   ting is fixed until you change it.  If  you
                                   don't  specify  this, WAF uses the vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The rules  in  the  referenced  rule  group
                                   whose  actions  are set to Count . When you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it  would  if  the rule action setting were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a single rule in a rule  group
                                      whose  action  you  want  to override to
                                      Count . When you  exclude  a  rule,  WAF
                                      evaluates  it exactly as it would if the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a rule group without modifying how  they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the rule whose action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                                      PayloadType -> (string)
                                          The payload type for your login end-
                                          point, either JSON or form encoded.

                                      UsernameField -> (structure)
                                          Details  about your login page user-
                                          name field.

                                          Identifier -> (string)
                                             The name of the  username  field.
                                             For example /form/username .

                                      PasswordField -> (structure)

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search against labels that have been  added  to
                               the  web request by rules that have already run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix,  optional  namespaces, and label name. The
                               prefix identifies the rule  group  or  web  ACL
                               context  of  the  rule that added the label. If
                               you do not provide the fully qualified name  in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search for labels that were added in  the  same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The string to match  against.  The  setting
                                   you  provide  for this depends on the match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then  this
                                     specification  must  include the name and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space  specifications  and  prefix  up to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If the Scope indicates NAMESPACE  ,  then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of contiguous namespace strings, and  can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from the rule group or web ACL where  the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used  to search web request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers

                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is  the
                                             same   as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,  but
                                             first converts backslash  charac-

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE
                                             , but  with  support  for  Micro-
                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the

                     ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to run the rules  that  are  de-
                        fined  in  a  managed rule group. To use this, provide
                        the vendor name and the name of the rule group in this
                        statement.  You  can  retrieve  the  required names by
                        calling  ListAvailableManagedRuleGroups .

                        You cannot nest a ManagedRuleGroupStatement , for  ex-
                        ample  for  use inside a NotStatement or OrStatement .
                        It can only be referenced  as  a  top-level  statement
                        within a rule.

                        VendorName -> (string)
                            The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use
                            this, along with the rule group name, to  identify
                            the rule group.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The  name of the managed rule group. You use this,
                            along with the vendor name, to identify  the  rule
                            group.

                        Version -> (string)
                            The  version  of the managed rule group to use. If
                            you specify this, the version setting is fixed un-
                            til  you change it. If you don't specify this, WAF
                            uses the vendor's default version, and then  keeps
                            the  version at the vendor's default when the ven-
                            dor updates the managed rule group settings.

                        ExcludedRules -> (list)
                            The rules in the referenced rule group  whose  ac-
                            tions  are set to Count . When you exclude a rule,
                            WAF evaluates it exactly as it would if  the  rule
                            action  setting  were Count . This is a useful op-
                            tion for testing the rules in a rule group without
                            modifying how they handle your web traffic.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies  a  single rule in a rule group whose
                               action you want to override to Count . When you
                               exclude  a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as it
                               would if the rule action setting were  Count  .
                               This  is  a useful option for testing the rules
                               in a rule group without modifying how they han-
                               dle your web traffic.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The  name of the rule whose action you want
                                   to override to Count .

                        ScopeDownStatement -> (structure)
                            An optional  nested  statement  that  narrows  the
                            scope  of  the  web requests that are evaluated by
                            the managed rule group. Requests are  only  evalu-
                            ated   by   the  rule  group  if  they  match  the
                            scope-down statement. You  can  use  any  nestable
                            Statement in the scope-down statement, and you can
                            nest statements at any level, the same as you  can
                            for a rule statement.

                            ByteMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that defines a string match
                               search for WAF to apply to  web  requests.  The
                               byte  match  statement  provides  the  bytes to
                               search for, the location in requests  that  you
                               want  WAF  to  search,  and other settings. The
                               bytes to search for are typically a string that
                               corresponds  with  ASCII characters. In the WAF
                               console and the developer guide, this  is  ref-
                               ered to as a string match statement.

                               SearchString -> (blob)
                                   A  string value that you want WAF to search
                                   for. WAF searches only in the part  of  web
                                   requests  that you designate for inspection
                                   in  FieldToMatch . The  maximum  length  of
                                   the value is 50 bytes.

                                   Valid  values  depend on the component that
                                   you specify for inspection in  FieldToMatch
                                   :

                                   o Method  :  The  HTTP method that you want
                                     WAF to search  for.  This  indicates  the
                                     type  of  operation  specified in the re-
                                     quest.

                                   o UriPath : The value that you want WAF  to
                                     search  for in the URI path, for example,
                                     /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   If SearchString includes alphabetic charac-
                                   ters  A-Z  and  a-z, note that the value is
                                   case sensitive.
                                      If you're using the WAF API

                                   Specify a  base64-encoded  version  of  the
                                   value.  The maximum length of the value be-
                                   fore you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.

                                   For example, suppose the value of  Type  is
                                   HEADER  and the value of Data is User-Agent
                                   . If you  want  to  search  the  User-Agent
                                   header   for   the   value   BadBot  ,  you
                                   base64-encode BadBot using MIME  base64-en-
                                   coding and include the resulting value, Qm-
                                   FkQm90 , in the value of SearchString .
                                      If you're using the CLI or  one  of  the
                                      Amazon Web Services SDKs

                                   The  value that you want WAF to search for.
                                   The SDK automatically  base64  encodes  the
                                   value.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement , with  a   SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement  that  enforces an 8 KB
                                      size limit on the body of  the  request.
                                      WAF  doesn't  support inspecting the en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-

                                             are  not compressed. Unterminated
                                             comments are also replaced with a
                                             space  (ASCII  0x20).  However, a
                                             standalone termination of a  com-

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI - Like  URL_DECODE
                                             ,  but  with  support  for Micro-

                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all

                               PositionalConstraint -> (string)
                                   The  area  within  the portion of a web re-
                                   quest that  you  want  WAF  to  search  for
                                   SearchString  .  Valid  values  include the
                                   following:
                                      CONTAINS

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include the value of SearchString , but the
                                   location doesn't matter.
                                      CONTAINS_WORD

                                   The specified part of the web request  must
                                   include  the  value  of  SearchString , and
                                   SearchString must contain only alphanumeric
                                   characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or
                                   _). In addition,  SearchString  must  be  a
                                   word,  which means that both of the follow-
                                   ing are true:

                                   o SearchString is at the beginning  of  the
                                     specified  part  of the web request or is
                                     preceded by a character other than an al-
                                     phanumeric  character  or underscore (_).
                                     Examples include the value  of  a  header
                                     and ;BadBot .

                                   o SearchString  is at the end of the speci-
                                     fied part of the web request or  is  fol-
                                     lowed  by  a  character other than an al-

                                     for example, BadBot; and -BadBot; .

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the beginning of the specified part of  the
                                   web request.
                                      ENDS_WITH

                                   The  value  of  SearchString must appear at
                                   the end of the specified part  of  the  web
                                   request.

                            SqliMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               Attackers  sometimes  insert malicious SQL code
                               into web requests in an effort to extract  data
                               from  your  database. To allow or block web re-
                               quests that appear  to  contain  malicious  SQL
                               code,  create  one  or more SQL injection match
                               conditions. An SQL  injection  match  condition
                               identifies  the  part  of web requests, such as
                               the URI or the query string, that you want  WAF
                               to inspect. Later in the process, when you cre-
                               ate a web ACL, you specify whether to allow  or
                               block requests that appear to contain malicious
                               SQL code.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-

                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             usual formatting to disguise some
                                             or all of the command.

                                          o Delete the following characters: \

                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process,  so  it  can help to un-

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated

                                             SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex
                                             data. Example (0x414243 ) will be
                                             decoded to (ABC ).

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code is in the  full-width  ASCII
                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E  , the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                            XssMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule  statement  that  defines  a  cross-site
                               scripting  (XSS)  match search for WAF to apply
                               to web requests. XSS attacks  are  those  where
                               the  attacker  uses vulnerabilities in a benign
                               website  as  a  vehicle  to  inject   malicious
                               client-site  scripts  into other legitimate web
                               browsers. The XSS match statement provides  the
                               location  in  requests  that  you  want  WAF to
                               search and text transformations to use  on  the
                               search  area  before WAF searches for character
                               sequences  that  are  likely  to  be  malicious
                               strings.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)

                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192

                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the

                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             ters . This function uses  up  to
                                             two   bytes   in   the   decoding
                                             process, so it can  help  to  un-

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination

                                             code  range  of  FF01-FF5E , then
                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and  adjust  the  lower  byte. If
                                             not, only the lower byte is  used
                                             and  the  higher  byte is zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-
                                             mation.

                                             LOWERCASE   -  Convert  uppercase

                                             soft-specific %u encoding. If the
                                             code  is  in the full-width ASCII
                                             code range  of  FF01-FF5E  ,  the
                                             higher byte is used to detect and
                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE  -  Convert   all

                            SizeConstraintStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  that  compares  a number of
                               bytes against the size of a request  component,
                               using  a  comparison  operator, such as greater
                               than (>) or less than (<). For example, you can
                               use  a  size  constraint  statement to look for
                               query strings that are longer than 100 bytes.

                               If you configure WAF  to  inspect  the  request
                               body, WAF inspects only the first 8192 bytes (8
                               KB). If the request body for your web  requests
                               never exceeds 8192 bytes, you can create a size
                               constraint condition and  block  requests  that
                               have a request body greater than 8192 bytes.

                               If  you choose URI for the value of Part of the
                               request to filter on, the slash (/) in the  URI
                               counts  as  one character. For example, the URI
                               /logo.jpg is nine characters long.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to   inspect.  For  more  information,  see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a  single  header.  Provide  the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple, User-Agent or Referer .  This  set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example  JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the query header to  in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the name of the query  argument  to  in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This  is  used  only to indicate the web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example  JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument": {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  query  argument  to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is
                                      the part of a web request  that  identi-
                                      fies   a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the query string.  This  is  the
                                      part  of  a  URL  that appears after a ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body as plain  text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request headers. This is the part  of  a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data that you want to send to  your  web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note that only  the  first  8  KB  (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to WAF for inspection by the  underlying
                                      host  service.  If you don't need to in-
                                      spect more than 8 KB, you can  guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by combining a statement  that  inspects
                                      the  body  of  the  web request, such as
                                      ByteMatchStatement  or   RegexPatternSe-
                                      tReferenceStatement  ,  with a  SizeCon-
                                      straintStatement that enforces an  8  KB
                                      size  limit  on the body of the request.
                                      WAF doesn't support inspecting  the  en-
                                      tire contents of web requests whose bod-
                                      ies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the HTTP method. The method  in-
                                      dicates  the  type of operation that the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request body  as  JSON.  The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest  that contains any additional data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as  the  HTTP request body, such as data
                                      from a form.

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body.  WAF  inspects  the results of
                                          these pattern  matches  against  the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match  all  of  the elements. See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or  the  IncludedPaths set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match only the specified  include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide the include  paths  using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                                             about this syntax, see the Inter-

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or the All setting, but  not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't  use this option to in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against using the MatchPattern .  If
                                          you   specify   All  ,  WAF  matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What WAF should do if  it  fails  to
                                          completely  parse the JSON body. The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING -  Inspect  the
                                            body  as  plain  text. WAF applies
                                            the text transformations  and  in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for the  JSON  inspection  to  the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH  -  Treat the web request as
                                            matching the rule  statement.  WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request
                                            as  not  matching  the rule state-
                                            ment.

                                          If you don't provide  this  setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF  does  its best to parse the en-
                                          tire JSON body, but might be  forced
                                          to  stop for reasons such as invalid
                                          characters, duplicate keys,  trunca-
                                          tion,  and  any  content  whose root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples  as  two  valid  key, value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                   The  operator to use to compare the request
                                   part to the size setting.

                               Size -> (long)
                                   The size, in byte, to compare  to  the  re-
                                   quest part, after any transformations.

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text  transformations eliminate some of the
                                   unusual formatting that  attackers  use  in
                                   web  requests in an effort to bypass detec-
                                   tion. If you specify one or more  transfor-
                                   mations  in  a rule statement, WAF performs
                                   all transformations on the content  of  the
                                   request   component  identified  by  Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting,  before inspecting the content for
                                   a match.

                                      Text transformations eliminate  some  of
                                      the  unusual  formatting  that attackers
                                      use in web requests in an effort to  by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets  the  relative processing order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are  defined  for  a rule statement.
                                          WAF processes  all  transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent.  The  priorities don't need to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE - Decode  a  Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT   -   Decode  a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who inject  an  operating  system

                                             these  characters  with  a  space
                                             character (decimal 32):

                                             encoded  using  CSS encoding that
                                             wouldnt  typically  be   encoded.
                                             It's  also  useful  in countering
                                             evasion, which is  a  combination
                                             of  a backslash and non-hexadeci-
                                             mal  characters.   For   example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE  -  Decode a string of
                                             hexadecimal characters into a bi-

                                             the higher byte is used to detect
                                             and adjust  the  lower  byte.  If
                                             not,  only the lower byte is used
                                             and the higher  byte  is  zeroed,
                                             causing a possible loss of infor-

                                             occurrence  of  a C-style comment
                                             (/* ... */ ) with a single space.
                                             Multiple  consecutive occurrences
                                             are not compressed.  Unterminated

                                             URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded
                                             value.

                                             URL_DECODE_UNI  - Like URL_DECODE

                                             adjust the lower byte. Otherwise,
                                             only the lower byte is  used  and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                                             UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all

                            GeoMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to identify web  requests
                               based on country of origin.

                               CountryCodes -> (list)
                                   An  array  of  two-character country codes,
                                   for example, [ "US", "CN" ] , from the  al-
                                   pha-2 country ISO codes of the ISO 3166 in-
                                   ternational standard.

                                   (string)

                               ForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            RuleGroupReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a  RuleGroup . To use this, create a
                               rule  group  with  your rules, then provide the
                               ARN of the rule group in this statement.

                               You cannot nest a RuleGroupReferenceStatement ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . You can only  use  a  rule  group
                               reference  statement  at the top level inside a
                               web ACL.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  en-
                                   tity.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            IPSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rule  statement  used to detect web requests
                               coming from particular IP addresses or  address
                               ranges.  To  use  this,  create  an  IPSet that
                               specifies the addresses  you  want  to  detect,
                               then use the ARN of that set in this statement.
                               To create an IP set, see  CreateIPSet .

                               Each IP set rule  statement  references  an  IP
                               set.  You  create and maintain the set indepen-
                               dent of your rules. This allows you to use  the
                               single  set  in multiple rules. When you update
                               the referenced set, WAF  automatically  updates
                               all rules that reference it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                   IPSet that this statement references.

                               IPSetForwardedIPConfig -> (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of the HTTP header to use for
                                      the IP address. For example, to use  the
                                      X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header, set this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The  match  status  to assign to the web
                                      request if the request  doesn't  have  a
                                      valid  IP address in the specified posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If  the   specified   header   isn't
                                          present  in the request, WAF doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You  can  specify the following fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching  the  rule statement. WAF ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH - Treat the  web  request  as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      The position in the header to search for
                                      the IP address. The header  can  contain
                                      IP  addresses of the original client and
                                      also of proxies. For example, the header
                                      value   could  be  10.1.1.1,  127.0.0.0,
                                      10.10.10.10 where the first  IP  address
                                      identifies  the  original client and the
                                      rest identify proxies that  the  request
                                      went through.

                                      The  options  for  this  setting are the
                                      following:

                                      o FIRST - Inspect the first  IP  address
                                        in  the  list  of  IP addresses in the
                                        header. This is usually  the  client's
                                        original IP.

                                      o LAST  - Inspect the last IP address in
                                        the  list  of  IP  addresses  in   the
                                        header.

                                      o ANY  - Inspect all IP addresses in the
                                        header for a match. If the header con-
                                        tains  more  than 10 IP addresses, WAF
                                        inspects the last 10.

                            RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components  for  matches  with  regular expres-
                               sions. To use this, create  a   RegexPatternSet
                               that specifies the expressions that you want to
                               detect, then use the ARN of that  set  in  this
                               statement.  A  web  request matches the pattern
                               set rule statement  if  the  request  component
                               matches any of the patterns in the set. To cre-
                               ate a regex pattern set,  see   CreateRegexPat-
                               ternSet .

                               Each  regex  pattern  set rule statement refer-
                               ences a regex pattern set. You create and main-
                               tain  the  set  independent of your rules. This
                               allows you to use the single  set  in  multiple
                               rules.  When you update the referenced set, WAF
                               automatically updates all rules that  reference
                               it.

                               ARN -> (string)
                                   The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Reg-
                                   exPatternSet  that  this  statement  refer-
                                   ences.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      Example JSON: "SingleHeader": {  "Name":
                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                      Example JSON:  "SingleQueryArgument":  {
                                      "Name": "myArgument" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name  of  the query argument to
                                          inspect.

                                   AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                                      Inspect all query arguments.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data

                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-

                                             encoded using CSS  encoding  that
                                             wouldnt   typically  be  encoded.
                                             It's also  useful  in  countering
                                             evasion,  which  is a combination
                                             of a backslash and  non-hexadeci-
                                             mal   characters.   For  example,
                                             ja\vascript for javascript.

                                             ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE  -  Decode  the

                                             remain in the output.

                                             HEX_DECODE - Decode a  string  of

                                             ning of the input from  an  input
                                             string.

                                             NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN  - This is the
                                             same  as  NORMALIZE_PATH  ,   but
                                             first  converts backslash charac-
                                             ters to forward slashes.

                                             REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL

                                             standalone termination of a  com-
                                             ment (*/ ) is not acted upon.

                                             only  the  lower byte is used and
                                             the higher byte is zeroed.

                            RateBasedStatement -> (structure)
                               A  rate-based  rule tracks the rate of requests
                               for each originating IP address,  and  triggers
                               the  rule  action when the rate exceeds a limit
                               that you specify on the number of  requests  in
                               any 5-minute time span. You can use this to put
                               a temporary block on requests from  an  IP  ad-
                               dress that is sending excessive requests.

                               WAF  tracks and manages web requests separately
                               for each instance of a rate-based rule that you
                               use.  For  example,  if  you  provide  the same
                               rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs,  each
                               of  the  two rule statements represents a sepa-
                               rate instance of the rate-based rule  and  gets
                               its  own tracking and management by WAF. If you
                               define a rate-based rule inside a  rule  group,
                               and  then  use  that  rule  group  in  multiple
                               places, each use creates a separate instance of
                               the  rate-based rule that gets its own tracking
                               and management by WAF.

                               When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks addi-
                               tional  requests  from the IP address until the
                               request rate falls below the limit.

                               You can optionally nest another  statement  in-
                               side  the  rate-based  statement, to narrow the
                               scope of the rule so that it  only  counts  re-
                               quests that match the nested statement. For ex-
                               ample, based on recent requests that  you  have
                               seen  from  an  attacker,  you  might  create a
                               rate-based rule with a nested AND  rule  state-
                               ment  that contains the following nested state-
                               ments:

                               o An IP match statement with  an  IP  set  that
                                 specified the address 192.0.2.44.

                               o A string match statement that searches in the
                                 User-Agent header for the string BadBot.

                               In this rate-based rule, you also define a rate
                               limit.  For  this  example,  the  rate limit is
                               1,000. Requests that meet both  of  the  condi-
                               tions  in  the  statements  are counted. If the
                               count exceeds 1,000 requests per five  minutes,
                               the  rule action triggers. Requests that do not
                               meet both conditions are  not  counted  towards
                               the  rate  limit  and  are not affected by this
                               rule.

                               You cannot nest a RateBasedStatement inside an-
                               other statement, for example inside a NotState-
                               ment or OrStatement . You can  define  a  Rate-
                               BasedStatement  inside  a  web ACL and inside a
                               rule group.

                               Limit -> (long)
                                   The limit on requests per  5-minute  period
                                   for a single originating IP address. If the
                                   statement includes a  ScopeDownStatement  ,
                                   this  limit is applied only to the requests
                                   that match the statement.

                               AggregateKeyType -> (string)
                                   Setting that indicates how to aggregate the
                                   request counts. The options are the follow-
                                   ing:

                                   o IP - Aggregate the request counts on  the
                                     IP address from the web request origin.

                                   o FORWARDED_IP   -  Aggregate  the  request
                                     counts on the first IP address in an HTTP
                                     header.  If  you  use this, configure the
                                     ForwardedIPConfig , to specify the header
                                     to use.

                               (   ...  recursive  ...  )ForwardedIPConfig  ->
                               (structure)
                                   The configuration  for  inspecting  IP  ad-
                                   dresses in an HTTP header that you specify,
                                   instead of using the IP address that's  re-
                                   ported by the web request origin. Commonly,
                                   this is the X-Forwarded-For  (XFF)  header,
                                   but you can specify any header name.

                                   NOTE:
                                      If the specified header isn't present in
                                      the request, WAF doesn't apply the  rule
                                      to the web request at all.

                                   This is required if AggregateKeyType is set
                                   to FORWARDED_IP .

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The name of the HTTP header to  use  for
                                      the  IP address. For example, to use the
                                      X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header,  set  this
                                      to X-Forwarded-For .

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                   FallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                      The match status to assign  to  the  web
                                      request  if  the  request doesn't have a
                                      valid IP address in the specified  posi-
                                      tion.

                                      NOTE:
                                          If   the   specified   header  isn't
                                          present in the request, WAF  doesn't
                                          apply the rule to the web request at
                                          all.

                                      You can specify the  following  fallback
                                      behaviors:

                                      o MATCH  -  Treat  the  web  request  as
                                        matching the rule statement.  WAF  ap-
                                        plies the rule action to the request.

                                      o NO_MATCH  -  Treat  the web request as
                                        not matching the rule statement.

                            AndStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to combine  other
                               rule  statements  with  AND  logic. You provide
                               more than one  Statement within  the  AndState-
                               ment .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to combine with AND logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            OrStatement -> (structure)
                               A  logical rule statement used to combine other
                               rule statements with OR logic. You provide more
                               than one  Statement within the OrStatement .

                               Statements -> (list)
                                   The  statements  to  combine with OR logic.
                                   You can use  any  statements  that  can  be
                                   nested.

                                   ( ... recursive ... )

                            NotStatement -> (structure)
                               A logical rule statement used to negate the re-
                               sults of another rule  statement.  You  provide
                               one  Statement within the NotStatement .

                            ManagedRuleGroupStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used to run the rules that are
                               defined in a managed rule group. To  use  this,
                               provide  the  vendor  name  and the name of the
                               rule group in this statement. You can  retrieve
                               the  required names by calling  ListAvailableM-
                               anagedRuleGroups .

                               You cannot nest a  ManagedRuleGroupStatement  ,
                               for  example  for  use inside a NotStatement or
                               OrStatement . It can only be  referenced  as  a
                               top-level statement within a rule.

                               VendorName -> (string)
                                   The  name of the managed rule group vendor.
                                   You use this, along  with  the  rule  group
                                   name, to identify the rule group.

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the managed rule group. You use
                                   this, along with the vendor name, to  iden-
                                   tify the rule group.

                               Version -> (string)
                                   The  version  of  the managed rule group to
                                   use. If you specify this, the version  set-
                                   ting  is  fixed until you change it. If you
                                   don't specify this, WAF uses  the  vendor's
                                   default version, and then keeps the version
                                   at the vendor's default when the vendor up-
                                   dates the managed rule group settings.

                               ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                   The  rules  in  the  referenced  rule group
                                   whose actions are set to Count .  When  you
                                   exclude a rule, WAF evaluates it exactly as
                                   it would if the rule  action  setting  were
                                   Count . This is a useful option for testing
                                   the rules in a rule group without modifying
                                   how they handle your web traffic.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies  a single rule in a rule group
                                      whose action you  want  to  override  to
                                      Count  .  When  you  exclude a rule, WAF
                                      evaluates it exactly as it would if  the
                                      rule action setting were Count . This is
                                      a useful option for testing the rules in
                                      a  rule group without modifying how they
                                      handle your web traffic.

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The name of the  rule  whose  action
                                          you want to override to Count .

                            LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement that defines  a  string  match
                               search  against  labels that have been added to
                               the web request by rules that have already  run
                               in the web ACL.

                               The label match statement provides the label or
                               namespace  string  to  search  for.  The  label
                               string can represent a part or all of the fully
                               qualified label name that had been added to the
                               web request. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                               fix, optional namespaces, and label  name.  The
                               prefix  identifies  the  rule  group or web ACL
                               context of the rule that added  the  label.  If
                               you  do not provide the fully qualified name in
                               your  label  match  string,  WAF  performs  the
                               search  for  labels that were added in the same
                               context as the label match statement.

                               Scope -> (string)
                                   Specify whether you want to match using the
                                   label name or just the namespace.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The  string  to  match against. The setting
                                   you provide for this depends on  the  match
                                   statement's Scope setting:

                                   o If  the Scope indicates LABEL , then this
                                     specification must include the  name  and
                                     can include any number of preceding name-
                                     space specifications  and  prefix  up  to
                                     providing the fully qualified label name.

                                   o If  the  Scope indicates NAMESPACE , then
                                     this specification can include any number
                                     of  contiguous namespace strings, and can
                                     include the entire label namespace prefix
                                     from  the rule group or web ACL where the
                                     label originates.

                                   Labels are case sensitive and components of
                                   a label must be separated by colon, for ex-
                                   ample NS1:NS2:name .

                            RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                               A rule statement used  to  search  web  request
                               components for a match against a single regular
                               expression.

                               RegexString -> (string)
                                   The string representing the regular expres-
                                   sion.

                               FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                                   The part of a web request that you want WAF
                                   to  inspect.  For  more  information,   see
                                   FieldToMatch .

                                   SingleHeader -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide the
                                      name of the header to inspect, for exam-
                                      ple,  User-Agent  or Referer . This set-
                                      ting isn't case sensitive.

                                      "haystack" }

                                      Name -> (string)
                                          The  name of the query header to in-
                                          spect.

                                   SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                                      Inspect a single query argument. Provide
                                      the  name  of  the query argument to in-
                                      spect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .
                                      The name can be up to 30 characters long
                                      and isn't case sensitive.

                                      This is used only to  indicate  the  web
                                      request component for WAF to inspect, in
                                      the  FieldToMatch specification.

                                   UriPath -> (structure)
                                      Inspect the request URI  path.  This  is
                                      the  part  of a web request that identi-
                                      fies  a  resource,  for  example,   /im-
                                      ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                                   QueryString -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  query  string. This is the
                                      part of a URL that  appears  after  a  ?
                                      character, if any.

                                   Body -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the request body as plain text.
                                      The request body immediately follows the
                                      request  headers.  This is the part of a
                                      request  that  contains  any  additional
                                      data  that  you want to send to your web
                                      server as the HTTP request body, such as
                                      data from a form.

                                      Note  that  only  the  first  8 KB (8192
                                      bytes) of the request body are forwarded
                                      to  WAF for inspection by the underlying
                                      host service. If you don't need  to  in-
                                      spect  more than 8 KB, you can guarantee
                                      that you don't allow additional bytes in
                                      by  combining  a statement that inspects
                                      the body of the  web  request,  such  as

                                   Method -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the HTTP method. The method in-
                                      dicates the type of operation  that  the
                                      request is asking the origin to perform.

                                   JsonBody -> (structure)
                                      Inspect  the  request  body as JSON. The
                                      request body immediately follows the re-
                                      quest headers. This is the part of a re-
                                      quest that contains any additional  data
                                      that you want to send to your web server
                                      as the HTTP request body, such  as  data

                                      MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                          The patterns to look for in the JSON
                                          body. WAF inspects  the  results  of
                                          these  pattern  matches  against the
                                          rule inspection criteria.

                                          All -> (structure)
                                             Match all of  the  elements.  See
                                             also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting or  the  IncludedPaths  set-
                                             ting, but not both.

                                          IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                             Match  only the specified include
                                             paths.  See  also  MatchScope  in
                                             JsonBody .

                                             Provide  the  include paths using
                                             JSON Pointer syntax. For example,
                                             "IncludedPaths": ["/dogs/0/name",
                                             "/dogs/1/name"] . For information

                                             You must specify either this set-
                                             ting  or the All setting, but not
                                             both.

                                             NOTE:
                                                 Don't use this option to  in-
                                                 clude all paths. Instead, use
                                                 the All setting.

                                             (string)

                                      MatchScope -> (string)
                                          The  parts  of  the  JSON  to  match
                                          against  using the MatchPattern . If
                                          you  specify  All  ,   WAF   matches
                                          against keys and values.

                                      InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                          What  WAF  should  do if it fails to
                                          completely parse the JSON body.  The
                                          options are the following:

                                          o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the
                                            body as plain  text.  WAF  applies
                                            the  text  transformations and in-
                                            spection criteria that you defined
                                            for  the  JSON  inspection  to the
                                            body text string.

                                          o MATCH - Treat the web  request  as
                                            matching  the  rule statement. WAF
                                            applies the rule action to the re-
                                            quest.

                                          o NO_MATCH  -  Treat the web request
                                            as not matching  the  rule  state-
                                            ment.

                                          If  you  don't provide this setting,
                                          WAF parses and evaluates the content
                                          only up to the first parsing failure
                                          that it encounters.

                                          WAF does its best to parse  the  en-
                                          tire  JSON body, but might be forced
                                          to stop for reasons such as  invalid
                                          characters,  duplicate keys, trunca-
                                          tion, and  any  content  whose  root
                                          node isn't an object or an array.

                                          WAF parses the JSON in the following
                                          examples as  two  valid  key,  value
                                          pairs:

                                          o Missing                     comma:
                                            {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                          o Missing                     colon:
                                            {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                          o Extra                      colons:
                                            {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                               TextTransformations -> (list)
                                   Text transformations eliminate some of  the
                                   unusual  formatting  that  attackers use in
                                   web requests in an effort to bypass  detec-
                                   tion.  If you specify one or more transfor-
                                   mations in a rule statement,  WAF  performs
                                   all  transformations  on the content of the
                                   request  component  identified  by   Field-
                                   ToMatch , starting from the lowest priority
                                   setting, before inspecting the content  for
                                   a match.

                                   (structure)
                                      Text  transformations  eliminate some of
                                      the unusual  formatting  that  attackers
                                      use  in web requests in an effort to by-
                                      pass detection.

                                      Priority -> (integer)
                                          Sets the relative  processing  order
                                          for  multiple  transformations  that
                                          are defined for  a  rule  statement.
                                          WAF  processes  all transformations,
                                          from lowest priority to highest, be-
                                          fore inspecting the transformed con-
                                          tent. The priorities don't  need  to
                                          be consecutive, but they must all be
                                          different.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          You can specify the following trans-
                                          formation types:
                                             BASE64_DECODE  -  Decode a Base64
                                             -encoded string.

                                             BASE64_DECODE_EXT  -   Decode   a
                                             Base64 -encoded string, but use a
                                             forgiving implementation that ig-
                                             nores   characters   that  aren't
                                             valid.

                                             CMD_LINE - Command-line transfor-
                                             mations. These are helpful in re-
                                             ducing effectiveness of attackers
                                             who  inject  an  operating system
                                             command-line command and use  un-

                                      The name of the username field. For  ex-
                                      ample /form/username .

                               PasswordField -> (structure)
                                   Details  about  your  login  page  password
                                   field.

                                   Identifier -> (string)
                                      The name of the password field. For  ex-
                                      ample /form/password .

                     LabelMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A  rule  statement  that defines a string match search
                        against labels that have been added to the web request
                        by rules that have already run in the web ACL.

                        The  label match statement provides the label or name-
                        space string to search for. The label string can  rep-
                        resent a part or all of the fully qualified label name
                        that had been added to the web request.  Fully  quali-
                        fied  labels  have  a prefix, optional namespaces, and
                        label name. The prefix identifies the  rule  group  or
                        web  ACL  context of the rule that added the label. If
                        you do not provide the fully qualified  name  in  your
                        label match string, WAF performs the search for labels
                        that were added in the same context as the label match
                        statement.

                        Scope -> (string)
                            Specify  whether you want to match using the label
                            name or just the namespace.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The string to match against. The setting you  pro-
                            vide  for  this  depends  on the match statement's
                            Scope setting:

                            o If the Scope indicates LABEL , then this  speci-
                              fication  must  include the name and can include
                              any number of preceding namespace specifications
                              and  prefix  up to providing the fully qualified
                              label name.

                            o If the Scope indicates  NAMESPACE  ,  then  this
                              specification can include any number of contigu-
                              ous namespace strings, and can include  the  en-
                              tire  label namespace prefix from the rule group
                              or web ACL where the label originates.

                            Labels are case sensitive and components of a  la-
                            bel  must  be  separated  by  colon,  for  example
                            NS1:NS2:name .

                     RegexMatchStatement -> (structure)
                        A rule statement used to search web request components
                        for a match against a single regular expression.

                        RegexString -> (string)
                            The string representing the regular expression.

                        FieldToMatch -> (structure)
                            The part of a web request that you want WAF to in-
                            spect. For more information, see  FieldToMatch .

                            SingleHeader -> (structure)
                               Inspect a single header. Provide  the  name  of
                               the  header to inspect, for example, User-Agent
                               or Referer . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                               Example   JSON:   "SingleHeader":   {   "Name":
                               "haystack" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query header to inspect.

                            SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                               Inspect  a  single  query argument. Provide the
                               name of the query argument to inspect, such  as
                               UserName or SalesRegion . The name can be up to
                               30 characters long and isn't case sensitive.

                               This is used only to indicate the  web  request
                               component  for  WAF  to inspect, in the  Field-
                               ToMatch specification.

                               Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": {  "Name":
                               "myArgument" }

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the query argument to inspect.

                            AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                               Inspect all query arguments.

                            UriPath -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the request URI path. This is the part
                               of a web request that  identifies  a  resource,
                               for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                            QueryString -> (structure)
                               Inspect the query string. This is the part of a
                               URL that appears after a ? character, if any.

                            Body -> (structure)
                               Inspect the request body as plain text. The re-
                               quest  body  immediately  follows  the  request
                               headers. This is the part  of  a  request  that
                               contains  any  additional data that you want to
                               send to your web server  as  the  HTTP  request
                               body, such as data from a form.

                               Note  that  only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of
                               the request body are forwarded to WAF  for  in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't need to inspect more than 8 KB,  you  can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in by combining a statement that  inspects  the
                               body  of  the  web request, such as  ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an 8 KB size limit on the body of the  request.
                               WAF  doesn't support inspecting the entire con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                            Method -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  HTTP method. The method indicates
                               the type of operation that the request is  ask-
                               ing the origin to perform.

                            JsonBody -> (structure)
                               Inspect  the  request body as JSON. The request
                               body immediately follows the  request  headers.
                               This is the part of a request that contains any
                               additional data that you want to send  to  your
                               web  server  as  the HTTP request body, such as
                               data from a form.

                               Note that only the first 8 KB (8192  bytes)  of
                               the  request  body are forwarded to WAF for in-
                               spection by the underlying host service. If you
                               don't  need  to inspect more than 8 KB, you can
                               guarantee that you don't allow additional bytes
                               in  by  combining a statement that inspects the
                               body of the web request,  such  as   ByteMatch-
                               Statement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement
                               , with a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces
                               an  8 KB size limit on the body of the request.
                               WAF doesn't support inspecting the entire  con-
                               tents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                               KB limit.

                               MatchPattern -> (structure)
                                   The patterns to look for in the JSON  body.
                                   WAF  inspects  the results of these pattern
                                   matches against the rule inspection  crite-
                                   ria.

                                   All -> (structure)
                                      Match  all  of  the  elements.  See also
                                      MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the IncludedPaths setting, but not both.

                                   IncludedPaths -> (list)
                                      Match  only the specified include paths.
                                      See also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                                      Provide the  include  paths  using  JSON
                                      Pointer  syntax. For example, "Included-
                                      Paths": ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"]
                                      . For information about this syntax, see
                                      the  Internet  Engineering  Task   Force

                                      Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                                      You must specify either this setting  or
                                      the All setting, but not both.

                                      NOTE:
                                          Don't use this option to include all
                                          paths. Instead, use the All setting.

                                      (string)

                               MatchScope -> (string)
                                   The parts of the JSON to match against  us-
                                   ing the MatchPattern . If you specify All ,
                                   WAF matches against keys and values.

                               InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                                   What WAF should do  if  it  fails  to  com-
                                   pletely  parse  the  JSON body. The options
                                   are the following:

                                   o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body  as
                                     plain  text.  WAF applies the text trans-
                                     formations and inspection  criteria  that
                                     you  defined  for  the JSON inspection to
                                     the body text string.

                                   o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching
                                     the  rule statement. WAF applies the rule
                                     action to the request.

                                   o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request  as  not
                                     matching the rule statement.

                                   If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF
                                   parses and evaluates the content only up to
                                   the  first  parsing failure that it encoun-
                                   ters.

                                   WAF does its best to parse the entire  JSON
                                   body,  but might be forced to stop for rea-
                                   sons such as invalid characters,  duplicate
                                   keys,  truncation,  and  any  content whose
                                   root node isn't an object or an array.

                                   WAF parses the JSON in the following  exam-
                                   ples as two valid key, value pairs:

                                   o Missing                            comma:
                                     {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                                   o Missing                            colon:
                                     {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                                   o Extra                             colons:
                                     {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

                        TextTransformations -> (list)
                            Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual
                            formatting  that  attackers use in web requests in
                            an effort to bypass detection. If you specify  one
                            or  more  transformations in a rule statement, WAF
                            performs all transformations on the content of the
                            request  component  identified  by  FieldToMatch ,
                            starting from the lowest priority setting,  before
                            inspecting the content for a match.

                            (structure)
                               Text  transformations eliminate some of the un-
                               usual formatting that attackers use in web  re-
                               quests in an effort to bypass detection.

                               Priority -> (integer)
                                   Sets the relative processing order for mul-
                                   tiple transformations that are defined  for
                                   a  rule statement. WAF processes all trans-
                                   formations, from lowest priority  to  high-
                                   est, before inspecting the transformed con-
                                   tent. The priorities don't need to be  con-
                                   secutive, but they must all be different.

                               Type -> (string)
                                   You  can  specify the following transforma-
                                   tion types:
                                      BASE64_DECODE - Decode a Base64 -encoded
                                      string.

                                      BASE64_DECODE_EXT - Decode a Base64 -en-
                                      coded string, but use a forgiving imple-
                                      mentation  that  ignores characters that
                                      aren't valid.

                                      CMD_LINE - Command-line transformations.
                                      These are helpful in reducing effective-
                                      ness of attackers who inject an  operat-
                                      ing  system command-line command and use
                                      unusual formatting to disguise  some  or
                                      all of the command.

                                   o Delete the following characters: \ " ' ^

                                   o Delete  spaces before the following char-
                                     acters: / (

                                   o Replace the following characters  with  a
                                     space: , ;

                                   o Replace multiple spaces with one space

                                   o Convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lower-
                                     case (a-z)
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE  -  Replace   these
                                      characters with a space character (deci-
                                      mal 32):

                                   o \f , formfeed, decimal 12

                                   o \t , tab, decimal 9

                                   o \n , newline, decimal 10

                                   o \r , carriage return, decimal 13

                                   o \v , vertical tab, decimal 11

                                   o Non-breaking space, decimal 160
                                      COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces  mul-
                                      tiple spaces with one space.

                                      CSS_DECODE - Decode characters that were
                                      encoded using CSS 2.x escape rules  syn-
                                      data.html#characters   .  This  function
                                      uses up to two  bytes  in  the  decoding
                                      process, so it can help to uncover ASCII
                                      characters that were encoded  using  CSS
                                      encoding  that  wouldnt typically be en-
                                      coded. It's also  useful  in  countering
                                      evasion,  which  is  a  combination of a
                                      backslash  and  non-hexadecimal  charac-
                                      ters. For example, ja\vascript for java-
                                      script.

                                      ESCAPE_SEQ_DECODE - Decode the following
                                      ANSI  C escape sequences: \a , \b , \f ,
                                      \n , \r , \t , \v , \\ , \? , \' , \"  ,
                                      \xHH  (hexadecimal),  \0OOO (octal). En-
                                      codings that aren't valid remain in  the
                                      output.

                                      HEX_DECODE - Decode a string of hexadec-
                                      imal characters into a binary.

                                      HTML_ENTITY_DECODE  -  Replace  HTML-en-
                                      coded  characters with unencoded charac-
                                      ters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs  these
                                      operations:

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)quot; with "

                                   o Replaces    (ampersand)nbsp;    with    a
                                     non-breaking space, decimal 160

                                   o Replaces  (ampersand)lt;  with  a   "less
                                     than" symbol

                                   o Replaces (ampersand)gt; with >

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh;
                                     , with the corresponding characters

                                   o Replaces  characters that are represented
                                     in decimal  format,  (ampersand)#nnnn;  ,
                                     with the corresponding characters
                                      JS_DECODE - Decode JavaScript escape se-
                                      quences. If a \  u  HHHH code is in  the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , then the higher byte is used to detect
                                      and  adjust the lower byte. If not, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte  is zeroed, causing a possible loss
                                      of information.

                                      LOWERCASE -  Convert  uppercase  letters
                                      (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).

                                      MD5  -  Calculate  an  MD5 hash from the
                                      data in the input. The computed hash  is
                                      in a raw binary form.

                                      NONE  -  Specify  NONE if you don't want
                                      any text transformations.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   -    Remove    multiple
                                      slashes,  directory self-references, and
                                      directory back-references that  are  not
                                      at  the  beginning  of the input from an
                                      input string.

                                      NORMALIZE_PATH_WIN - This is the same as
                                      NORMALIZE_PATH   ,  but  first  converts
                                      backslash characters to forward slashes.

                                      REMOVE_NULLS -  Remove  all  NULL  bytes
                                      from the input.

                                      REPLACE_COMMENTS  -  Replace each occur-
                                      rence of a C-style comment (/* ... */  )
                                      with  a  single space. Multiple consecu-
                                      tive occurrences are not compressed. Un-
                                      terminated  comments  are  also replaced
                                      with a space (ASCII  0x20).  However,  a
                                      standalone  termination of a comment (*/
                                      ) is not acted upon.

                                      REPLACE_NULLS - Replace  NULL  bytes  in
                                      the  input  with space characters (ASCII
                                      0x20 ).

                                      SQL_HEX_DECODE - Decode  SQL  hex  data.
                                      Example  (0x414243  ) will be decoded to
                                      (ABC ).

                                      URL_DECODE - Decode a URL-encoded value.

                                      URL_DECODE_UNI - Like URL_DECODE  ,  but
                                      with  support  for Microsoft-specific %u
                                      encoding.  If  the  code   is   in   the
                                      full-width ASCII code range of FF01-FF5E
                                      , the higher byte is used to detect  and
                                      adjust  the  lower byte. Otherwise, only
                                      the lower byte is used  and  the  higher
                                      byte is zeroed.

                                      UTF8_TO_UNICODE   -  Convert  all  UTF-8
                                      character  sequences  to  Unicode.  This
                                      helps  input normalization, and minimiz-
                                      ing false-positives and  false-negatives
                                      for non-English languages.

                 Action -> (structure)
                     The  action that WAF should take on a web request when it
                     matches the rule statement. Settings at the web ACL level
                     can override the rule action setting.

                     This  is used only for rules whose statements do not ref-
                     erence a rule group. Rule  statements  that  reference  a
                     rule  group  include RuleGroupReferenceStatement and Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     You must specify either this Action setting or  the  rule
                     OverrideAction setting, but not both:

                     o If  the rule statement does not reference a rule group,
                       use this rule action setting and not the rule  override
                       action setting.

                     o If  the rule statement references a rule group, use the
                       override action setting and not this action setting.

                     Block -> (structure)
                        Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                        CustomResponse -> (structure)
                            Defines a custom response for the web request.

                            For information about customizing web requests and
                            responses,  see  Customizing  web requests and re-
                            sponses in WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            ResponseCode -> (integer)
                               The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                               For a list of status codes that you can use  in
                               your  custom  reqponses,  see  Supported status
                               codes for custom response in the WAF  Developer
                               Guide .

                            CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                               References  the response body that you want WAF
                               to return to the web request  client.  You  can
                               define a custom response for a rule action or a
                               default web ACL action that is set to block. To
                               do this, you first define the response body key
                               and value in the  CustomResponseBodies  setting
                               for the  WebACL or  RuleGroup where you want to
                               use it. Then, in the rule action or web ACL de-
                               fault action BlockAction setting, you reference

                     it to count to override the result to count only.

                     You can only use this for rule statements that  reference
                     a  rule  group, like RuleGroupReferenceStatement and Man-
                     agedRuleGroupStatement .

                     NOTE:
                        This option is usually set to none. It does not affect
                        how  the rules in the rule group are evaluated. If you

                        matches,  do  not  use  this and instead exclude those
                        rules in your rule group reference statement settings.

                     None -> (structure)
                        Don't  override the rule group evaluation result. This
                        is the most common setting.

                 RuleLabels -> (list)
                     Labels to apply to web requests that match the rule match
                     statement. WAF applies fully qualified labels to matching
                     web requests. A fully qualified label is  the  concatena-
                     tion  of  a  label namespace and a rule label. The rule's
                     rule group or web ACL defines the label namespace.

                     Rules that run after this rule in the web ACL  can  match
                     against these labels using a LabelMatchStatement .

                     For  each label, provide a case-sensitive string contain-
                     ing optional namespaces and a label  name,  according  to
                     the following guidelines:

                     o Separate each component of the label with a colon.

                     o Each namespace or name can have up to 128 characters.

                     o You can specify up to 5 namespaces in a label.

                     o Don't  use  the  following reserved words in your label
                       specification: aws , waf , managed , rulegroup , webacl
                       , regexpatternset , or ipset .

                     For  example,  myLabelName or nameSpace1:nameSpace2:myLa-
                     belName .

                     (structure)
                        A single label container. This is used as  an  element
                        of a label array in multiple contexts, for example, in
                        RuleLabels inside a  Rule and in Labels inside a  Sam-
                        pledHTTPRequest .

                     quest sample collection.

                     SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean indicating whether WAF should store  a  sam-
                        pling  of  the  web requests that match the rules. You
                        can view the sampled requests through the WAF console.

                     CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                        A boolean indicating whether the  associated  resource
                        sends  metrics  to  Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of
                        available metrics, see WAF Metrics .

                     MetricName -> (string)

                        phen), and _ (underscore). The name can be from one to
                        128  characters  long.  It can't contain whitespace or
                        metric names reserved for WAF, for example  "All"  and
                        "Default_Action."

                 CaptchaConfig -> (structure)

                     you don't specify this, WAF uses the  CAPTCHA  configura-
                     tion that's defined for the web ACL.

                     ImmunityTimeProperty -> (structure)
                        Determines  how long a CAPTCHA token remains valid af-
                        ter the client successfully solves a CAPTCHA puzzle.

                        ImmunityTime -> (long)
                            The amount of time, in seconds, that a CAPTCHA to-
                            ken is valid. The default setting is 300.

          VisibilityConfig -> (structure)
              Defines  and  enables  Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request
              sample collection.

              SampledRequestsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean indicating whether WAF should store a  sampling  of
                 the  web requests that match the rules. You can view the sam-
                 pled requests through the WAF console.

              CloudWatchMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A boolean indicating whether the  associated  resource  sends
                 metrics  to Amazon CloudWatch. For the list of available met-
                 rics, see WAF Metrics .

              MetricName -> (string)
                 A name of the Amazon CloudWatch metric. The name can  contain
                 only the characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - (hyphen), and _ (under-
                 score). The name can be from one to 128 characters  long.  It
                 can't  contain  whitespace  or metric names reserved for WAF,
                 for example "All" and "Default_Action."

          LabelNamespace -> (string)
              The label namespace prefix for this rule group. All labels added
              by rules in this rule group have this prefix.

              o The syntax for the label namespace prefix for your rule groups
                is the following:   awswaf:<account ID>:rulegroup:<rule  group
                name>:

              o When  a  rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the
                fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified  label
                is  made  up of the label namespace from the rule group or web
                ACL where the rule is defined and the  label  from  the  rule,
                separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from rule>

          CustomResponseBodies -> (map)
              A  map of custom response keys and content bodies. When you cre-
              ate a rule with a block action, you can send a  custom  response
              to  the  web  request.  You define these for the rule group, and
              then use them in the rules that you define in the rule group.

              For information about customizing web  requests  and  responses,
              see Customizing web requests and responses in WAF in the WAF De-
              veloper Guide .

              For information about the limits on count and  size  for  custom
              request  and response settings, see WAF quotas in the WAF Devel-
              oper Guide .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 The response body to use in a custom response to  a  web  re-
                 quest.  This  is referenced by key from  CustomResponse  Cus-
                 tomResponseBodyKey .

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     The type of content in the payload that you are  defining
                     in the Content string.

                 Content -> (string)
                     The payload of the custom response.

                     You  can  use  JSON escape strings in JSON content. To do
                     this, you must specify JSON content  in  the  ContentType
                     setting.

                     For  information  about  the limits on count and size for
                     custom request and response settings, see WAF  quotas  in
                     the WAF Developer Guide .

          AvailableLabels -> (list)
              The  labels  that  one  or  more rules in this rule group add to
              matching web requests. These labels are defined in  the  RuleLa-
              bels for a  Rule .

              (structure)
                 List  of  labels used by one or more of the rules of a  Rule-
                 Group . This summary object is used for  the  following  rule
                 group lists:

                 o AvailableLabels  -  Labels  that  rules add to matching re-
                   quests. These labels are defined in the  RuleLabels  for  a
                   Rule .

                 o ConsumedLabels - Labels that rules match against. These la-
                   bels are defined in a LabelMatchStatement specification, in
                   the  Statement definition of a rule.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An individual label specification.

          ConsumedLabels -> (list)
              The  labels  that  one  or  more  rules in this rule group match
              against in label match statements. These labels are defined in a
              LabelMatchStatement  specification, in the  Statement definition
              of a rule.

              (structure)
                 List of labels used by one or more of the rules of  a   Rule-
                 Group  .  This  summary object is used for the following rule
                 group lists:

                 o AvailableLabels - Labels that rules  add  to  matching  re-
                   quests.  These  labels  are defined in the RuleLabels for a
                   Rule .

                 o ConsumedLabels - Labels that rules match against. These la-
                   bels are defined in a LabelMatchStatement specification, in
                   the  Statement definition of a rule.

                 Name -> (string)
                     An individual label specification.

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.
