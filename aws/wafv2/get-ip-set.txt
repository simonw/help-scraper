GET-IP-SET()                                                      GET-IP-SET()



NAME
       get-ip-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the specified  IPSet .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ip-set
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of an IPSet after
          you create it.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the  set. This ID is returned in the re-
          sponses to create and list commands. You provide  it  to  operations
          like update and delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a specific IP set

       The  following get-ip-set retrieves the IP set with the specified name,
       scope, and ID. You can get the ID for an IP set from the commands  cre-
       ate-ip-set and list-ip-sets.

          aws wafv2 get-ip-set \
              --name testip \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "IPSet":{
                  "Description":"",
                  "Name":"testip",
                  "IPAddressVersion":"IPV4",
                  "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE1111",
                  "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/ipset/testip/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE1111",
                  "Addresses":[
                      "192.0.2.0/16"
                  ]
              },
              "LockToken":"447e55ac-2396-4c6d-b9f9-86b67c17f8b5"
          }

       WAF, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       IPSet -> (structure)
          Name -> (string)
              The name of the IP set. You cannot change the name of  an  IPSet
              after you create it.

          Id -> (string)
              A  unique identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the re-
              sponses to create and list commands. You provide  it  to  opera-
              tions like update and delete.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the IP set that helps with identification.

          IPAddressVersion -> (string)
              The version of the IP addresses, either IPV4 or IPV6 .

          Addresses -> (list)
              Contains  an array of strings that specifies zero or more IP ad-
              dresses or blocks of  IP  addresses  in  Classless  Inter-Domain
              Routing  (CIDR)  notation.  WAF  supports all IPv4 and IPv6 CIDR
              ranges except for /0.

              Example address strings:

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated from the IP address 192.0.2.44, specify 192.0.2.44/32 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated from IP addresses from 192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255,  spec-
                ify 192.0.2.0/24 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated          from          the          IP          address
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111,               specify
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0111/128 .

              o To configure WAF to allow, block, or count requests that orig-
                inated              from              IP             addresses
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000                     to
                1111:0000:0000:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff,               specify
                1111:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000/64 .

              try Classless Inter-Domain Routing .

              Example JSON Addresses specifications:

              o Empty array: "Addresses": []

              o Array with one address: "Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32"]

              o Array  with  three  addresses:  "Addresses": ["192.0.2.44/32",
                "192.0.2.0/24", "192.0.0.0/16"]

              o INVALID specification: "Addresses": [""] INVALID

              (string)

       LockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.
