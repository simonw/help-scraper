NAME
       describe-managed-rule-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides high-level information for a managed rule group, including de-
       scriptions of the rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-managed-rule-group
          --vendor-name <value>
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          [--version-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vendor-name (string)
          The name of the managed rule group vendor. You use this, along  with
          the rule group name, to identify the rule group.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of  the  managed rule group. You use this, along with the
          vendor name, to identify the rule group.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --version-name (string)
          The  version  of  the rule group. You can only use a version that is
          not scheduled for expiration. If you don't provide  this,  WAF  uses
          the vendor's default version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       wall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VersionName -> (string)
          The managed rule group's version.

       SnsTopicArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  resource  name  (ARN) of the Amazon Simple Notification
          Service SNS topic that's used to record changes to the managed  rule
          group.  You  can subscribe to the SNS topic to receive notifications
          when the managed rule group is modified, such as  for  new  versions
          and  for  version  expiration.  For more information, see the Amazon
          Simple Notification Service Developer Guide .

       Capacity -> (long)
          The web ACL capacity units (WCUs) required for this rule group.  WAF
          uses web ACL capacity units (WCU) to calculate and control the oper-
          ating resources that are used to run your rules,  rule  groups,  and
          web ACLs. WAF calculates capacity differently for each rule type, to
          reflect each rule's relative cost. Rule group capacity is  fixed  at
          creation,  so users can plan their web ACL WCU usage when they use a
          rule group. The WCU limit for web ACLs is 1,500.

       Rules -> (list)
          (structure)
              High-level information about a  Rule ,  returned  by  operations
              like   DescribeManagedRuleGroup . This provides information like
              the ID, that you can use to retrieve and manage  a  RuleGroup  ,
              and  the  ARN, that you provide to the  RuleGroupReferenceState-
              ment to use the rule group in a  Rule .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Action -> (structure)
                 The action that WAF should take on  a  web  request  when  it
                 matches a rule's statement. Settings at the web ACL level can
                 override the rule action setting.

                 Block -> (structure)
                     Instructs WAF to block the web request.

                     CustomResponse -> (structure)
                        Defines a custom response for the web request.

                        For information about customizing web requests and re-
                        sponses, see Customizing web requests and responses in
                        WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        ResponseCode -> (integer)
                            The HTTP status code to return to the client.

                            For a list of status codes that  you  can  use  in
                            your  custom reqponses, see Supported status codes
                            for custom response in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        CustomResponseBodyKey -> (string)
                            References the response body that you want WAF  to
                            return to the web request client. You can define a
                            custom response for a rule action or a default web
                            ACL  action  that is set to block. To do this, you
                            first define the response body key  and  value  in
                            the  CustomResponseBodies  setting for the  WebACL
                            or  RuleGroup where you want to use it.  Then,  in
                            the rule action or web ACL default action BlockAc-
                            tion setting, you reference the response body  us-
                            ing this key.

                        ResponseHeaders -> (list)
                            The HTTP headers to use in the response. Duplicate
                            header names are not allowed.

                            For information about the limits on count and size
                            for  custom request and response settings, see WAF
                            quotas in the WAF Developer Guide .

                            (structure)
                               A custom header for custom request and response
                               handling.  This  is used in  CustomResponse and
                               CustomRequestHandling .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For custom request header  insertion,  when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it
                                   prefixes this name x-amzn-waf- ,  to  avoid
                                   confusion with the headers that are already
                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name   sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the  header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value of the custom header.

                 Allow -> (structure)
                     Instructs WAF to allow the web request.

                     CustomRequestHandling -> (structure)
                        Defines custom handling for the web request.

                        For information about customizing web requests and re-
                        sponses, see Customizing web requests and responses in
                        WAF in the WAF Developer Guide .

                        InsertHeaders -> (list)
                            The HTTP headers to insert into the  request.  Du-
                            plicate header names are not allowed.

                            For information about the limits on count and size

                            (structure)
                               A custom header for custom request and response
                               handling. This is used in   CustomResponse  and
                               CustomRequestHandling .

                               Name -> (string)
                                   The name of the custom header.

                                   For  custom  request header insertion, when
                                   WAF inserts the header into the request, it

                                   in the request. For example, for the header
                                   name  sample  ,  WAF  inserts  the   header
                                   x-amzn-waf-sample .

            is the following:   awswaf:managed:<vendor>:<rule group name> :

          o When a rule with a label matches a web request, WAF adds the fully
            qualified label to the request. A fully qualified label is made up
            of the label namespace from the rule group or web  ACL  where  the
            rule is defined and the label from the rule, separated by a colon:
            <label namespace>:<label from rule>

              lists:

              o AvailableLabels - Labels that rules add to matching  requests.
                These labels are defined in the RuleLabels for a  Rule .

              o ConsumedLabels - Labels that rules match against. These labels
                are defined in a  LabelMatchStatement  specification,  in  the
                Statement definition of a rule.

              Name -> (string)
                 An individual label specification.

       ConsumedLabels -> (list)
          The  labels  that one or more rules in this rule group match against
          in label match statements. These labels are defined in a LabelMatch-
          Statement specification, in the  Statement definition of a rule.

          (structure)
              List  of labels used by one or more of the rules of a  RuleGroup
