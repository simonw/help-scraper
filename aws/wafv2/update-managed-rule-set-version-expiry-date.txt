UPDATE-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSION-EUPDATE-MANAGED-RULE-SET-VERSION-EXPIRY-DATE()



NAME
       update-managed-rule-set-version-expiry-date -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the expiration information for your managed rule set. Use this
       to initiate the expiration of a managed rule group version.  After  you
       initiate  expiration for a version, WAF excludes it from the reponse to
       ListAvailableManagedRuleGroupVersions for the managed rule group.

       NOTE:
          This is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets.  Ven-
          dors  are  Amazon  Web  Services and Amazon Web Services Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers. The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet ,  Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

SYNOPSIS
            update-managed-rule-set-version-expiry-date
          --name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --id <value>
          --lock-token <value>
          --version-to-expire <value>
          --expiry-timestamp <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name of the managed rule set. You use this, along with the rule
          set ID, to identify the rule set.

          This name is assigned to the corresponding managed rule group, which
          your customers can access and use.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --id (string)
          A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID is returned  in
          the  responses  to commands like list . You provide it to operations
          like get and update .

       --lock-token (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and  list  requests,  to mark the state of the entity at the time of
          the request. To make changes to the entity associated with  the  to-
          ken,  you  provide  the token to operations like update and delete .
          WAF uses the token to ensure that no changes have been made  to  the
          entity  since  you last retrieved it. If a change has been made, the
          update fails with a WAFOptimisticLockException .  If  this  happens,
          perform  another get , and use the new token returned by that opera-
          tion.

       --version-to-expire (string)
          The version that you want to remove from your list of offerings  for
          the named managed rule group.

       --expiry-timestamp (timestamp)
          The time that you want the version to expire.

          Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format in-
          cludes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExpiringVersion -> (string)
          The version that is set to expire.

       ExpiryTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time that the version will expire.

          Times are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format in-
          cludes the special designator, Z. For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z".

       NextLockToken -> (string)
          A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to your get
          and list requests, to mark the state of the entity at  the  time  of
          the  request.  To make changes to the entity associated with the to-
          ken, you provide the token to operations like update  and  delete  .
          WAF  uses  the token to ensure that no changes have been made to the
          entity since you last retrieved it. If a change has been  made,  the
          update  fails  with  a WAFOptimisticLockException . If this happens,
          perform another get , and use the new token returned by that  opera-
          tion.
