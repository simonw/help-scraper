NAME
       list-managed-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the managed rule sets that you own.

       NOTE:
          This  is intended for use only by vendors of managed rule sets. Ven-
          dors are Amazon Web Services and  Amazon  Web  Services  Marketplace
          sellers.

          Vendors, you can use the managed rule set APIs to provide controlled
          rollout of your versioned managed rule group offerings for your cus-
          tomers.  The APIs are ListManagedRuleSets , GetManagedRuleSet , Put-
          ManagedRuleSetVersions , and UpdateManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

SYNOPSIS
            list-managed-rule-sets
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST  API,  or  an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of objects that you want WAF to return for this
          request. If more objects are available, in the  response,  WAF  pro-
          vides  a  NextMarker  value that you can use in a subsequent call to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       ManagedRuleSets -> (list)
          Your managed rule sets.

          (structure)
              High-level information for a managed rule set.

              NOTE:
                 This is intended for use only  by  vendors  of  managed  rule
                 sets. Vendors are Amazon Web Services and Amazon Web Services
                 Marketplace sellers.

                 Vendors, you can use the managed rule  set  APIs  to  provide
                 controlled  rollout  of your versioned managed rule group of-
                 ferings for your customers. The APIs are  ListManagedRuleSets
                 , GetManagedRuleSet , PutManagedRuleSetVersions , and Update-
                 ManagedRuleSetVersionExpiryDate .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the managed rule set. You use  this,  along  with
                 the rule set ID, to identify the rule set.

                 This  name  is  assigned  to  the  corresponding managed rule
                 group, which your customers can access and use.

              Id -> (string)
                 A unique identifier for the managed rule set. The ID  is  re-
                 turned  in  the responses to commands like list . You provide
                 it to operations like get and update .

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the set that helps with identification.

              LockToken -> (string)
                 A token used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a  token  to
                 your  get  and list requests, to mark the state of the entity
                 at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity as-
                 sociated  with the token, you provide the token to operations
                 like update and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no
                 changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved
                 it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOp-
                 timisticLockException  . If this happens, perform another get
                 , and use the new token returned by that operation.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.

              LabelNamespace -> (string)
                 The label namespace prefix for the managed rule  groups  that
                 are  offered to customers from this managed rule set. All la-
                 bels that are added by rules in the managed rule  group  have
                 this prefix.

                 o The  syntax  for  the  label namespace prefix for a managed
                   rule  group  is   the   following:     awswaf:managed:<ven-
                   dor>:<rule group name> :

                 o When  a  rule  with a label matches a web request, WAF adds
                   the fully qualified label to the request. A fully qualified
                   label is made up of the label namespace from the rule group
                   or web ACL where the rule is defined and the label from the
                   rule, separated by a colon:   <label namespace>:<label from
                   rule>
