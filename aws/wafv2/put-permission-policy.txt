OPTIONS

          The policy specifications must conform to the following:

            version 2015-01-01.

          o The  policy  must include specifications for Effect , Action , and
            Principal .

          o Effect must specify Allow .

          o Action must specify wafv2:CreateWebACL , wafv2:UpdateWebACL ,  and
            wafv2:PutFirewallManagerRuleGroups   and  may  optionally  specify
            wafv2:GetRuleGroup . WAF rejects any extra actions or wildcard ac-
            tions in the policy.

          o The policy must not include a Resource parameter.

          For more information, see IAM Policies .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
