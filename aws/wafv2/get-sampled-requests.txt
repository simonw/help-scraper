GET-SAMPLED-REQUESTS()                                  GET-SAMPLED-REQUESTS()



NAME
       get-sampled-requests -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  detailed information about a specified number of requests--a sam-
       ple--that WAF randomly selects from among the first 5,000 requests that
       your Amazon Web Services resource received during a time range that you
       choose. You can specify a sample size of up to 500  requests,  and  you
       can specify any time range in the previous three hours.
          GetSampledRequests  returns  a time range, which is usually the time
          range that you specified. However,  if  your  resource  (such  as  a
          CloudFront  distribution)  received 5,000 requests before the speci-
          fied time range elapsed, GetSampledRequests returns an updated  time
          range.  This new time range indicates the actual period during which
          WAF selected the requests in the sample.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sampled-requests
          --web-acl-arn <value>
          --rule-metric-name <value>
          --scope <value>
          --time-window <value>
          --max-items <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --web-acl-arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) of the WebACL for which  you  want  a
          sample of requests.

       --rule-metric-name (string)
          The metric name assigned to the Rule or RuleGroup for which you want
          a sample of requests.

       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --time-window (structure)
          The  start  date and time and the end date and time of the range for
          which you want GetSampledRequests to return a  sample  of  requests.
          You  must specify the times in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for-
          mat. UTC format includes the special designator, Z  .  For  example,
          "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can specify any time range in the previous
          three hours. If you specify a start time that's earlier  than  three
          hours ago, WAF sets it to three hours ago.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  beginning  of the time range from which you want GetSample-
              dRequests to return a sample of the requests  that  your  Amazon
              Web  Services  resource  received. You must specify the times in
              Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the
              special  designator,  Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You
              can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services
              resource received. You must specify  the  times  in  Coordinated
              Universal  Time  (UTC)  format.  UTC format includes the special
              designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can spec-
              ify any time range in the previous three hours.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StartTime=timestamp,EndTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StartTime": timestamp,
            "EndTime": timestamp
          }

       --max-items (long)
          The  number  of  requests that you want WAF to return from among the
          first 5,000 requests that your Amazon Web Services resource received
          during the time range. If your resource received fewer requests than
          the value of MaxItems , GetSampledRequests returns information about
          all of them.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       SampledRequests -> (list)
          A  complex type that contains detailed information about each of the
          requests in the sample.

          (structure)
              Represents a single sampled web request. The response from  Get-
              SampledRequests includes a SampledHTTPRequests complex type that
              appears as SampledRequests  in  the  response  syntax.  Sampled-
              HTTPRequests contains an array of SampledHTTPRequest objects.

              Request -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that contains detailed information about the
                 request.

                 ClientIP -> (string)
                     The IP address that the request originated from.  If  the

                     this is the value of  one  of  the  following  fields  in
                     CloudFront access logs:

                     o c-ip  ,  if  the  viewer did not use an HTTP proxy or a
                       load balancer to send the request

                     o x-forwarded-for , if the viewer did use an  HTTP  proxy
                       or a load balancer to send the request

                 Country -> (string)
                     The  two-letter country code for the country that the re-
                     quest originated from. For  a  current  list  of  country
                     codes, see the Wikipedia entry ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 URI -> (string)
                     The  URI  path  of  the request, which identifies the re-
                     source, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                 Method -> (string)
                     The HTTP method specified in the sampled web request.

                 HTTPVersion -> (string)
                     The HTTP version specified in the  sampled  web  request,
                     for example, HTTP/1.1 .

                 Headers -> (list)
                     A  complex type that contains the name and value for each
                     header in the sampled web request.

                     (structure)
                        Part of the response from  GetSampledRequests  .  This
                        is  a  complex type that appears as Headers in the re-
                        sponse syntax. HTTPHeader contains the names and  val-
                        ues  of  all  of the headers that appear in one of the
                        web requests.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP header.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the HTTP header.

              Weight -> (long)
                 A value that indicates how one result in the response relates
                 proportionally to other results in the response. For example,
                 a result that has a weight of 2 represents roughly  twice  as
                 many web requests as a result that has a weight of 1 .

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  at which WAF received the request from your Amazon
                 Web Services resource, in Unix time format (in seconds).

              Action -> (string)
                 The action for the Rule that the  request  matched:  Allow  ,
                 Block , or Count .

              RuleNameWithinRuleGroup -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the Rule that the request matched. For managed
                 rule groups, the format for this name is <vendor  name>#<man-
                 aged rule group name>#<rule name> . For your own rule groups,
                 the format for this name is <rule group name>#<rule  name>  .
                 If the rule is not in a rule group, this field is absent.

              RequestHeadersInserted -> (list)
                 Custom  request headers inserted by WAF into the request, ac-
                 cording to the custom request configuration for the  matching
                 rule action.

                 (structure)
                     Part of the response from  GetSampledRequests . This is a
                     complex type that appears as Headers in the response syn-
                     tax.  HTTPHeader  contains the names and values of all of
                     the headers that appear in one of the web requests.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the HTTP header.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the HTTP header.

              ResponseCodeSent -> (integer)
                 The response code that was sent for the request.

              Labels -> (list)
                 Labels applied to the web request by matching rules. WAF  ap-
                 plies  fully  qualified  labels  to  matching web requests. A
                 fully qualified label is the concatenation of a  label  name-
                 space  and a rule label. The rule's rule group or web ACL de-
                 fines the label namespace.

                 For           example,            awswaf:111122223333:myRule-
                 Group:testRules:testNS1:testNS2:labelNameA   or   awswaf:man-
                 aged:aws:managed-rule-set:header:encoding:utf8 .

                 (structure)
                     A single label container. This is used as an element of a
                     label array in multiple contexts, for example, in RuleLa-
                     bels inside a  Rule and  in  Labels  inside  a   Sampled-
                     HTTPRequest .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The label string.

              CaptchaResponse -> (structure)
                 The CAPTCHA response for the request.

                 ResponseCode -> (integer)
                     The  HTTP  response  code  indicating  the  status of the
                     CAPTCHA token in the web request. If the token  is  miss-
                     ing, invalid, or expired, this code is 405 Method Not Al-
                     lowed .

                 SolveTimestamp -> (long)
                     The time that the CAPTCHA puzzle was solved for the  sup-
                     plied token.

                 FailureReason -> (string)
                     The  reason for failure, populated when the evaluation of
                     the token fails.

       PopulationSize -> (long)
          The total number of requests from  which  GetSampledRequests  got  a
          sample of MaxItems requests. If PopulationSize is less than MaxItems
          , the sample includes every request that your  Amazon  Web  Services
          resource received during the specified time range.

       TimeWindow -> (structure)
          Usually, TimeWindow is the time range that you specified in the Get-
          SampledRequests request. However, if your Amazon  Web  Services  re-
          source  received more than 5,000 requests during the time range that
          you specified in the request, GetSampledRequests  returns  the  time
          range for the first 5,000 requests. Times are in Coordinated Univer-
          sal Time (UTC) format.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The beginning of the time range from which you  want  GetSample-
              dRequests  to  return  a sample of the requests that your Amazon
              Web Services resource received. You must specify  the  times  in
              Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC format includes the
              special designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z"  .  You
              can specify any time range in the previous three hours.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The end of the time range from which you want GetSampledRequests
              to return a sample of the requests that your Amazon Web Services
              resource  received.  You  must  specify the times in Coordinated
              Universal Time (UTC) format. UTC  format  includes  the  special
              designator, Z . For example, "2016-09-27T14:50Z" . You can spec-
              ify any time range in the previous three hours.
