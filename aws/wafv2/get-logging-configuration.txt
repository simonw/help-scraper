GET-LOGGING-CONFIGURATION()                        GET-LOGGING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-logging-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the  LoggingConfiguration for the specified web ACL.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-logging-configuration
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL for which you want to
          get the  LoggingConfiguration .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the logging configurations for a web ACL

       The  following get-logging-configuration retrieves the logging configu-
       ration for the specified web ACL.

          aws wafv2 get-logging-configuration \
              --resource-arn arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/test/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222 \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

                          }
                      }
                  ],
                  "LogDestinationConfigs":[

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  LoggingConfiguration for the specified web ACL.

          ResourceArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want to
              associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

          LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
              The logging destination configuration that you want to associate
              with the web ACL.

              NOTE:
                 You can associate one logging destination to a web ACL.

              (string)

          RedactedFields -> (list)
              The  parts of the request that you want to keep out of the logs.
              For example, if you redact the SingleHeader  field,  the  HEADER
              field in the logs will be xxx .

              NOTE:
                 You can specify only the following fields for redaction: Uri-
                 Path , QueryString , SingleHeader , Method , and JsonBody .

              (structure)
                 The part of a web request that you want WAF to  inspect.  In-
                 clude  the single FieldToMatch type that you want to inspect,
                 with additional specifications as needed,  according  to  the
                 type.  You specify a single request component in FieldToMatch
                 for each rule statement that requires  it.  To  inspect  more
                 than  one  component of a web request, create a separate rule
                 statement for each component.

                 JSON specification for a QueryString field to match:
                     "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }

                 Example JSON for a Method field to match specification:
                     "FieldToMatch": { "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                 SingleHeader -> (structure)
                     Inspect a single header. Provide the name of  the  header
                     to  inspect,  for  example,  User-Agent or Referer . This
                     setting isn't case sensitive.

                     Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the query header to inspect.

                 SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                     Inspect a single query argument. Provide the name of  the
                     query  argument  to inspect, such as UserName or SalesRe-
                     gion . The name can be up to 30 characters long and isn't
                     case sensitive.

                     This  is  used only to indicate the web request component
                     for WAF to inspect, in the  FieldToMatch specification.

                     Example JSON: "SingleQueryArgument": {  "Name":  "myArgu-
                     ment" }

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the query argument to inspect.

                 AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                     Inspect all query arguments.

                 UriPath -> (structure)
                     Inspect  the  request URI path. This is the part of a web
                     request that identifies a  resource,  for  example,  /im-
                     ages/daily-ad.jpg .

                 QueryString -> (structure)
                     Inspect  the query string. This is the part of a URL that
                     appears after a ? character, if any.

                 Body -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request body as plain text. The request  body
                     immediately follows the request headers. This is the part
                     of a request that contains any additional data  that  you
                     want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body,
                     such as data from a form.

                     Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                     body  are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underly-
                     ing host service. If you don't need to inspect more  than
                     8  KB,  you can guarantee that you don't allow additional
                     bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the  body
                     of  the web request, such as  ByteMatchStatement or  Reg-
                     exPatternSetReferenceStatement   ,   with   a    SizeCon-
                     straintStatement  that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the
                     body of the request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting  the
                     entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                     KB limit.

                 Method -> (structure)
                     Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type of
                     operation  that  the request is asking the origin to per-
                     form.

                 JsonBody -> (structure)
                     Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body  imme-
                     diately  follows the request headers. This is the part of
                     a request that contains any additional data that you want
                     to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such
                     as data from a form.

                     Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the request
                     body  are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the underly-
                     ing host service. If you don't need to inspect more  than
                     8  KB,  you can guarantee that you don't allow additional
                     bytes in by combining a statement that inspects the  body
                     of  the web request, such as  ByteMatchStatement or  Reg-
                     exPatternSetReferenceStatement   ,   with   a    SizeCon-
                     straintStatement  that enforces an 8 KB size limit on the
                     body of the request. WAF doesn't support  inspecting  the
                     entire contents of web requests whose bodies exceed the 8
                     KB limit.

                     MatchPattern -> (structure)
                        The patterns to look for in the  JSON  body.  WAF  in-
                        spects  the  results  of these pattern matches against
                        the rule inspection criteria.

                        All -> (structure)
                            Match all of the elements. See also MatchScope  in
                            JsonBody .

                            You  must  specify  either this setting or the In-
                            cludedPaths setting, but not both.

                        IncludedPaths -> (list)
                            Match only the specified include paths.  See  also
                            MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                            Provide  the include paths using JSON Pointer syn-
                            tax.      For      example,       "IncludedPaths":
                            ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] . For information
                            about this syntax, see  the  Internet  Engineering
                            Task  Force (IETF) documentation JavaScript Object
                            Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                            You must specify either this setting  or  the  All
                            setting, but not both.

                            NOTE:
                               Don't use this option to include all paths. In-
                               stead, use the All setting.

                            (string)

                     MatchScope -> (string)
                        The parts of the  JSON  to  match  against  using  the
                        MatchPattern  .  If  you  specify  All  ,  WAF matches
                        against keys and values.

                     InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                        What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse the
                        JSON body. The options are the following:

                        o EVALUATE_AS_STRING - Inspect the body as plain text.
                          WAF applies the text transformations and  inspection
                          criteria that you defined for the JSON inspection to
                          the body text string.

                        o MATCH - Treat the web request as matching  the  rule
                          statement.  WAF  applies  the rule action to the re-
                          quest.

                        o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching the
                          rule statement.

                        If  you  don't  provide  this  setting, WAF parses and
                        evaluates the content only up  to  the  first  parsing
                        failure that it encounters.

                        WAF  does  its best to parse the entire JSON body, but
                        might be forced to stop for reasons  such  as  invalid
                        characters,  duplicate  keys, truncation, and any con-
                        tent whose root node isn't an object or an array.

                        WAF parses the JSON in the following examples  as  two
                        valid key, value pairs:

                        o Missing comma: {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                        o Missing colon: {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                        o Extra colons: {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

          ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the logging configuration was created by Fire-
              wall Manager, as part of an WAF policy configuration.  If  true,
              only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configuration.

          LoggingFilter -> (structure)
              Filtering that specifies which web requests are kept in the logs
              and which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action and  on
              the  web request labels that were applied by matching rules dur-
              ing web ACL evaluation.

              Filters -> (list)
                 The filters that you want to apply to the logs.

                 (structure)
                     A single logging filter, used in  LoggingFilter .

                     Behavior -> (string)
                        How to handle logs that satisfy  the  filter's  condi-
                        tions and requirement.

                     Requirement -> (string)
                        Logic  to  apply  to the filtering conditions. You can
                        specify that, in order to satisfy the  filter,  a  log
                        must  match  all conditions or must match at least one
                        condition.

                     Conditions -> (list)
                        Match conditions for the filter.

                        (structure)
                            A single match condition for a  Filter .

                            ActionCondition -> (structure)
                               A single action condition.

                               Action -> (string)
                                   The action setting that a log  record  must
                                   contain in order to meet the condition.

                            LabelNameCondition -> (structure)
                               A single label name condition.

                               LabelName -> (string)
                                   The  label name that a log record must con-
                                   tain in order to meet the  condition.  This
                                   must be a fully qualified label name. Fully
                                   qualified labels have  a  prefix,  optional
                                   namespaces,  and  label  name.  The  prefix
                                   identifies the rule group or web  ACL  con-
                                   text of the rule that added the label.

              DefaultBehavior -> (string)
                 Default  handling for logs that don't match any of the speci-
                 fied filtering conditions.
