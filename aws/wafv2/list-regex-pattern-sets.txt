LIST-REGEX-PATTERN-SETS()                            LIST-REGEX-PATTERN-SETS()



NAME
       list-regex-pattern-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  an  array  of   RegexPatternSetSummary objects for the regex
       pattern sets that you manage.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-regex-pattern-sets
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies whether this is for an Amazon CloudFront  distribution  or
          for  a regional application. A regional application can be an Appli-
          cation Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an  App-
          Sync GraphQL API, or an Amazon Cognito user pool.

          To  work  with  CloudFront, you must also specify the Region US East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI - Specify the  Region  when  you  use  the  CloudFront  scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber of objects that are still available for  retrieval  exceeds  the
          limit,  WAF  returns a NextMarker value in the response. To retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum  number of objects that you want WAF to return for this
          request. If more objects are available, in the  response,  WAF  pro-
          vides  a  NextMarker  value that you can use in a subsequent call to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of regex pattern sets

       The following list-regex-pattern-sets retrieves all regex pattern  sets
       for the account that are defined in the region us-west-2.

          aws wafv2 list-regex-pattern-sets \
          --scope REGIONAL \
          --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "NextMarker":"regexPatterSet01",
              "RegexPatternSets":[
                  {
                      "ARN":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/regexpatternset/regexPatterSet01/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "Description":"Test web-acl",
                      "Name":"regexPatterSet01",

                      "Id":"a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       RegexPatternSets -> (list)
          (structure)
              High-level information about a  RegexPatternSet  ,  returned  by
              operations  like create and list. This provides information like
              the ID, that you can use to  retrieve  and  manage  a  RegexPat-
              ternSet  , and the ARN, that you provide to the  RegexPatternSe-
              tReferenceStatement to use the pattern set in a  Rule .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the data type instance.  You  cannot  change  the
                 name after you create the instance.

              Id -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the set. This ID is returned in the
                 responses to create and list commands. You provide it to  op-
                 erations like update and delete.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the set that helps with identification.

              LockToken -> (string)
                 A  token  used for optimistic locking. WAF returns a token to
                 your get and list requests, to mark the state of  the  entity
                 at the time of the request. To make changes to the entity as-
                 sociated with the token, you provide the token to  operations
                 like update and delete . WAF uses the token to ensure that no
                 changes have been made to the entity since you last retrieved
                 it. If a change has been made, the update fails with a WAFOp-
                 timisticLockException . If this happens, perform another  get
                 , and use the new token returned by that operation.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the entity.
