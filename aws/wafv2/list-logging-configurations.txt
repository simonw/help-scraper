NAME
       list-logging-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an array of your  LoggingConfiguration objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-logging-configurations
          --scope <value>
          [--next-marker <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --scope (string)
          Specifies  whether  this is for an Amazon CloudFront distribution or
          for a regional application. A regional application can be an  Appli-
          cation  Load  Balancer  (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an
          AppSync GraphQL API.

          To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the  Region  US  East
          (N. Virginia) as follows:

          o CLI  -  Specify  the  Region  when  you  use the CloudFront scope:
            --scope=CLOUDFRONT --region=us-east-1 .

          o API and SDKs - For all calls, use the Region endpoint us-east-1.

          Possible values:

          o CLOUDFRONT

          o REGIONAL

       --next-marker (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you want WAF to return  for  this
          request.  If  more  objects are available, in the response, WAF pro-
          vides a NextMarker value that you can use in a  subsequent  call  to
          get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve a list of all logging configurations for a region

       The following list-logging-configurations  retrieves  the  all  logging
       configurations  for  web  ACLs  that are scoped for regional use in the
       us-west-2 region.

          aws wafv2 list-logging-configurations \
              --scope REGIONAL \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "LoggingConfigurations":[
                  {
                      "ResourceArn":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/test-2/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

                              }
                          }
                      ],
                      "LogDestinationConfigs":[
                          "arn:aws:firehose:us-west-2:123456789012:deliverystream/aws-waf-logs-test"
                      ]
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceArn":"arn:aws:wafv2:us-west-2:123456789012:regional/webacl/test/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",

                              }
                          }
                      ],
                      "LogDestinationConfigs":[
                          "arn:aws:firehose:us-west-2:123456789012:deliverystream/aws-waf-logs-custom-transformation"
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoggingConfigurations -> (list)
          (structure)
              Defines  an  association  between logging destinations and a web
              ACL resource, for logging from WAF. As part of the  association,
              you can specify parts of the standard logging fields to keep out
              of the logs and you can specify filters so that you log  only  a
              subset of the logging records.

              For  information about configuring web ACL logging destinations,
              see Logging web ACL traffic information  in  the  WAF  Developer
              Guide .

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL that you want
                 to associate with LogDestinationConfigs .

              LogDestinationConfigs -> (list)
                 The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the logging  destinations
                 that you want to associate with the web ACL.

                 (string)

              RedactedFields -> (list)
                 The  parts  of  the  request that you want to keep out of the
                 logs. For example, if you redact the SingleHeader field,  the
                 HEADER field in the logs will be xxx .

                 NOTE:
                     You  can specify only the following fields for redaction:
                     UriPath , QueryString , SingleHeader , Method , and Json-
                     Body .

                 (structure)
                     The  part  of a web request that you want WAF to inspect.
                     Include the single FieldToMatch type that you want to in-
                     spect,  with additional specifications as needed, accord-
                     ing to the type. You specify a single  request  component
                     in FieldToMatch for each rule statement that requires it.
                     To inspect more than one component of a web request, cre-
                     ate a separate rule statement for each component.

                     JSON specification for a QueryString field to match:
                        "FieldToMatch": { "QueryString": {} }

                     Example JSON for a Method field to match specification:
                        "FieldToMatch": { "Method": { "Name": "DELETE" } }

                     SingleHeader -> (structure)
                        Inspect  a  single  header.  Provide  the  name of the
                        header to inspect, for example, User-Agent or  Referer
                        . This setting isn't case sensitive.

                        Example JSON: "SingleHeader": { "Name": "haystack" }

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query header to inspect.

                     SingleQueryArgument -> (structure)
                        Inspect  a  single query argument. Provide the name of
                        the query argument to inspect,  such  as  UserName  or
                        SalesRegion . The name can be up to 30 characters long
                        and isn't case sensitive.

                        This is used only to indicate the web  request  compo-
                        nent for WAF to inspect, in the  FieldToMatch specifi-
                        cation.

                        Example   JSON:   "SingleQueryArgument":   {   "Name":
                        "myArgument" }

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the query argument to inspect.

                     AllQueryArguments -> (structure)
                        Inspect all query arguments.

                     UriPath -> (structure)
                        Inspect  the  request  URI path. This is the part of a
                        web request that identifies a resource,  for  example,
                        /images/daily-ad.jpg .

                     QueryString -> (structure)
                        Inspect  the  query  string. This is the part of a URL
                        that appears after a ? character, if any.

                     Body -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request body as plain  text.  The  request
                        body  immediately follows the request headers. This is
                        the part of a request  that  contains  any  additional
                        data  that  you want to send to your web server as the
                        HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

                        Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the  re-
                        quest  body are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the
                        underlying host service. If you don't need to  inspect
                        more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don't allow
                        additional bytes in by combining a statement that  in-
                        spects  the  body  of the web request, such as  ByteM-
                        atchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ,
                        with  a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB
                        size limit on the body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                        support inspecting the entire contents of web requests
                        whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                     Method -> (structure)
                        Inspect the HTTP method. The method indicates the type
                        of  operation that the request is asking the origin to
                        perform.

                     JsonBody -> (structure)
                        Inspect the request body as JSON. The request body im-
                        mediately  follows  the  request  headers. This is the
                        part of a request that contains  any  additional  data
                        that  you  want to send to your web server as the HTTP
                        request body, such as data from a form.

                        Note that only the first 8 KB (8192 bytes) of the  re-
                        quest  body are forwarded to WAF for inspection by the
                        underlying host service. If you don't need to  inspect
                        more than 8 KB, you can guarantee that you don't allow
                        additional bytes in by combining a statement that  in-
                        spects  the  body  of the web request, such as  ByteM-
                        atchStatement or  RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement  ,
                        with  a  SizeConstraintStatement that enforces an 8 KB
                        size limit on the body of  the  request.  WAF  doesn't
                        support inspecting the entire contents of web requests
                        whose bodies exceed the 8 KB limit.

                        MatchPattern -> (structure)
                            The patterns to look for in the JSON body. WAF in-
                            spects   the  results  of  these  pattern  matches
                            against the rule inspection criteria.

                            All -> (structure)
                               Match all of the elements. See also  MatchScope
                               in  JsonBody .

                               You must specify either this setting or the In-
                               cludedPaths setting, but not both.

                            IncludedPaths -> (list)
                               Match only the  specified  include  paths.  See
                               also MatchScope in  JsonBody .

                               Provide  the  include  paths using JSON Pointer
                               syntax.    For    example,     "IncludedPaths":
                               ["/dogs/0/name", "/dogs/1/name"] . For informa-
                               tion about this syntax, see the Internet  Engi-
                               neering   Task   Force   (IETF)   documentation
                               JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Pointer .

                               You must specify either this setting or the All
                               setting, but not both.

                               NOTE:
                                   Don't use this option to include all paths.
                                   Instead, use the All setting.

                               (string)

                        MatchScope -> (string)
                            The parts of the JSON to match against  using  the
                            MatchPattern  .  If  you specify All , WAF matches
                            against keys and values.

                        InvalidFallbackBehavior -> (string)
                            What WAF should do if it fails to completely parse
                            the JSON body. The options are the following:

                            o EVALUATE_AS_STRING  -  Inspect the body as plain
                              text. WAF applies the text  transformations  and
                              inspection  criteria  that  you  defined for the
                              JSON inspection to the body text string.

                            o MATCH - Treat the web request  as  matching  the
                              rule  statement.  WAF applies the rule action to
                              the request.

                            o NO_MATCH - Treat the web request as not matching
                              the rule statement.

                            If  you don't provide this setting, WAF parses and
                            evaluates the content only up to the first parsing
                            failure that it encounters.

                            WAF  does  its best to parse the entire JSON body,
                            but might be forced to stop for  reasons  such  as
                            invalid  characters,  duplicate  keys, truncation,
                            and any content whose root node isn't an object or
                            an array.

                            WAF  parses  the JSON in the following examples as
                            two valid key, value pairs:

                            o Missing comma: {"key1":"value1""key2":"value2"}

                            o Missing colon: {"key1":"value1","key2""value2"}

                            o Extra colons: {"key1"::"value1","key2""value2"}

              ManagedByFirewallManager -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the logging configuration  was  created  by
                 Firewall  Manager, as part of an WAF policy configuration. If
                 true, only Firewall Manager can modify or delete the configu-
                 ration.

              LoggingFilter -> (structure)
                 Filtering  that  specifies which web requests are kept in the
                 logs and which are dropped. You can filter on the rule action
                 and  on  the web request labels that were applied by matching
                 rules during web ACL evaluation.

                 Filters -> (list)
                     The filters that you want to apply to the logs.

                     (structure)
                        A single logging filter, used in  LoggingFilter .

                        Behavior -> (string)
                            How to handle logs that satisfy the filter's  con-
                            ditions and requirement.

                        Requirement -> (string)
                            Logic  to  apply  to the filtering conditions. You
                            can specify that, in order to satisfy the  filter,
                            a  log  must match all conditions or must match at
                            least one condition.

                        Conditions -> (list)
                            Match conditions for the filter.

                            (structure)
                               A single match condition for a  Filter .

                               ActionCondition -> (structure)
                                   A single action condition.

                                   Action -> (string)
                                      The action setting  that  a  log  record
                                      must contain in order to meet the condi-
                                      tion.

                               LabelNameCondition -> (structure)
                                   A single label name condition.

                                   LabelName -> (string)
                                      The label name that a  log  record  must
                                      contain  in order to meet the condition.
                                      This must be  a  fully  qualified  label
                                      name. Fully qualified labels have a pre-
                                      fix,  optional  namespaces,  and   label
                                      name.  The  prefix  identifies  the rule
                                      group or web ACL  context  of  the  rule
                                      that added the label.

                 DefaultBehavior -> (string)
                     Default  handling  for  logs  that don't match any of the
                     specified filtering conditions.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          When you request a list of objects with a Limit setting, if the num-
          ber  of  objects  that are still available for retrieval exceeds the
          limit, WAF returns a NextMarker value in the response.  To  retrieve
          the next batch of objects, provide the marker from the prior call in
          your next request.
