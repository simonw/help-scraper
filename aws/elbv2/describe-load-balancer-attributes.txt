NAME
       describe-load-balancer-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  attributes for the specified Application Load Balancer,
       Network Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer.

       For more information, see the following:

       o Load balancer attributes in the Application Load Balancers Guide

       o Load balancer attributes in the Network Load Balancers Guide

       o Load balancer attributes in the Gateway Load Balancers Guide

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancer-attributes
          --load-balancer-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe load balancer attributes

       The  following  describe-load-balancer-attributes  example displays the
       attributes of the specified load balancer.

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (list)
          Information about the load balancer attributes.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:

                 o deletion_protection.enabled -  Indicates  whether  deletion
                   protection is enabled. The value is true or false . The de-
                   fault is false .

                 The following attributes are supported  by  both  Application
                 Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

                 o access_logs.s3.enabled  - Indicates whether access logs are
                   enabled. The value is true or false . The default is  false
                   .

                 o access_logs.s3.bucket  -  The name of the S3 bucket for the
                   access logs. This attribute is required if access logs  are
                   enabled.  The  bucket  must exist in the same region as the
                   load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants  Elastic
                   Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

                 o access_logs.s3.prefix  - The prefix for the location in the
                   S3 bucket for the access logs.

                 o ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic - Blocks internet  gateway  (IGW)
                   access  to the load balancer. It is set to false for inter-
                   net-facing load balancers and true for internal  load  bal-
                   ancers,  preventing unintended access to your internal load
                   balancer through an internet gateway.

                 The following attributes are supported  by  only  Application
                 Load Balancers:

                 o idle_timeout.timeout_seconds  -  The idle timeout value, in
                   seconds. The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default  is
                   60 seconds.

                 o routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode  -  Determines  how the
                   load balancer handles requests that might pose  a  security
                   risk to your application. The possible values are monitor ,
                   defensive , and strictest . The default is defensive .

                 o routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled - Indicates
                   whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed
                   by the load balancer (true ) or routed to targets (false ).
                   The default is false .

                 o routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled    -    Indicates
                   whether the Application Load Balancer should  preserve  the
                   Host  header  in the HTTP request and send it to the target
                   without any change. The possible values are true and  false
                   . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled  -
                   Indicates whether the two headers  (x-amzn-tls-version  and
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite  ), which contain information about
                   the negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are  added  to
                   the  client  request  before  sending it to the target. The
                   x-amzn-tls-version header has  information  about  the  TLS
                   protocol  version  negotiated  with  the  client,  and  the
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite header has  information  about  the
                   cipher  suite  negotiated with the client. Both headers are
                   in OpenSSL format. The possible values  for  the  attribute
                   are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled  -  Indicates  whether
                   the X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source  port
                   that  the  client used to connect to the load balancer. The
                   possible values are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_header_processing.mode -  Enables  you  to
                   modify,  preserve,  or remove the X-Forwarded-For header in
                   the HTTP request before the Application Load Balancer sends
                   the request to the target. The possible values are append ,
                   preserve , and remove . The default is append .

                   o If the value is append , the  Application  Load  Balancer
                     adds  the  client  IP  address  (of  the last hop) to the
                     X-Forwarded-For header in  the  HTTP  request  before  it
                     sends it to targets.

                   o If  the  value  is preserve the Application Load Balancer
                     preserves the X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP request,
                     and sends it to targets without any change.

                   o If  the  value  is remove , the Application Load Balancer
                     removes the X-Forwarded-For header in  the  HTTP  request
                     before it sends it to targets.

                 o routing.http2.enabled  -  Indicates  whether  HTTP/2 is en-
                   abled. The possible values are true and false . The default
                   is  true  .  Elastic  Load  Balancing requires that message
                   header names contain only alphanumeric characters  and  hy-
                   phens.

                 o waf.fail_open.enabled   -  Indicates  whether  to  allow  a
                   WAF-enabled load balancer to route requests to  targets  if
                   it  is unable to forward the request to Amazon Web Services
                   WAF. The possible values are true and false .  The  default
                   is false .

                 The  following  attribute  is  supported by Network Load Bal-
                 ancers and Gateway Load Balancers:

                 o load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled   -   Indicates   whether
                   cross-zone  load  balancing is enabled. The possible values
                   are true and false . The default is false .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.
