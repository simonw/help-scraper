CREATE-RULE()                                                    CREATE-RULE()



NAME
       create-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a rule for the specified listener. The listener must be associ-
       ated with an Application Load Balancer.

       Each rule consists of a priority, one or more actions, and one or  more
       conditions.  Rules  are  evaluated  in  priority order, from the lowest
       value to the highest value. When the conditions for a rule are met, its
       actions  are performed. If the conditions for no rules are met, the ac-
       tions for the default rule are performed.  For  more  information,  see
       Listener rules in the Application Load Balancers Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --conditions (list)
          The conditions.

          (structure)
              Information about a condition for a rule.

              Each  rule  can optionally include up to one of each of the fol-
              lowing conditions: http-request-method , host-header , path-pat-
              tern , and source-ip . Each rule can also optionally include one
              or more of each of the  following  conditions:  http-header  and
              query-string  .  Note  that  the value for a condition cannot be
              empty.

              Field -> (string)
                 The field in the HTTP request. The following are the possible
                 values:

                 o http-header

                 o http-request-method

                 o host-header

                 o path-pattern

                 o query-string

                 o source-ip

              Values -> (list)
                 The  condition  value. Specify only when Field is host-header
                 or path-pattern . Alternatively,  to  specify  multiple  host
                 names  or  multiple  path  patterns,  use HostHeaderConfig or
                 PathPatternConfig .

                 If Field is host-header and you are not using  HostHeaderCon-
                 fig , you can specify a single host name (for example, my.ex-
                 ample.com) in Values . A host name is case  insensitive,  can
                 be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the
                 following characters.

                 o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                 o

                   o .

                 o

                   o (matches 0 or more characters)

                 o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                 If Field is path-pattern and you are not  using  PathPattern-
                 Config  , you can specify a single path pattern (for example,
                 /img/
                 *
                 ) in Values . A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be up  to
                 128  characters in length, and can contain any of the follow-
                 ing characters.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 127)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                 o _ - . $ / ~ " ' @ : +

                 o & (using &amp;)

                 o

                   o (matches 0 or more characters)

                 o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                 (string)

              HostHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for a host header condition.  Specify  only  when
                 Field is host-header .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or more host names. The maximum size of each name is
                     128 characters. The comparison is case  insensitive.  The
                     following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0
                     or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                     If you specify multiple strings, the condition is  satis-
                     fied if one of the strings matches the host name.

                     (string)

              PathPatternConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  for  a path pattern condition. Specify only when
                 Field is path-pattern .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One or more path patterns to compare against the  request
                     URL.  The  maximum size of each string is 128 characters.
                     The comparison is case sensitive. The following  wildcard
                     characters  are  supported:  * (matches 0 or more charac-
                     ters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                     If you specify multiple strings, the condition is  satis-
                     fied  if  one  of  them matches the request URL. The path
                     pattern is compared only to the path of the URL,  not  to
                     its  query  string.  To compare against the query string,
                     use  QueryStringConditionConfig .

                     (string)

              HttpHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for an HTTP header condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is http-header .

                 HttpHeaderName -> (string)
                     The name of the HTTP header field. The maximum size is 40
                     characters. The header name is case insensitive. The  al-
                     lowed characters are specified by RFC 7230. Wildcards are
                     not supported.

                     You can't use an HTTP header  condition  to  specify  the
                     host  header. Use  HostHeaderConditionConfig to specify a
                     host header condition.

                 Values -> (list)
                     One or more strings to compare against the value  of  the
                     HTTP header. The maximum size of each string is 128 char-
                     acters. The comparison strings are case insensitive.  The
                     following wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0
                     or more characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                     If the same header appears multiple times in the request,
                     we search them in order until a match is found.

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of the strings matches the value of the  HTTP
                     header.  To  require that all of the strings are a match,
                     create one condition per string.

                     (string)

              QueryStringConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for a query string condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is query-string .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One  or  more  key/value  pairs  or values to find in the
                     query string. The maximum size  of  each  string  is  128
                     characters.  The comparison is case insensitive. The fol-
                     lowing wildcard characters are supported: * (matches 0 or
                     more  characters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character). To
                     search for a literal '*' or  '?'  character  in  a  query
                     string,  you must escape these characters in Values using
                     a '' character.

                     If you specify multiple key/value pairs  or  values,  the
                     condition  is  satisfied  if  one of them is found in the
                     query string.

                     (structure)
                        Information about a key/value pair.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key. You can omit the key.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value.

              HttpRequestMethodConfig -> (structure)
                 Information for an HTTP method condition. Specify  only  when
                 Field is http-request-method .

                 Values -> (list)
                     The  name  of  the request method. The maximum size is 40
                     characters. The allowed characters are A-Z,  hyphen  (-),
                     and  underscore  (_).  The  comparison is case sensitive.
                     Wildcards are not supported; therefore, the  method  name
                     must be an exact match.

                     If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is satis-
                     fied if one of  the  strings  matches  the  HTTP  request
                     method. We recommend that you route GET and HEAD requests
                     in the same way, because the response to a  HEAD  request
                     may be cached.

                     (string)

              SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
                 Information  for  a  source  IP  condition. Specify only when
                 Field is source-ip .

                 Values -> (list)
                     One or more source IP addresses, in CIDR format. You  can
                     use  both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wildcards are not sup-
                     ported.

                     If you specify multiple addresses, the condition is  sat-
                     isfied  if  the  source IP address of the request matches
                     one of the CIDR blocks. This condition is  not  satisfied
                     by the addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header. To search
                     for addresses in the X-Forwarded-For header,  use   Http-
                     HeaderConditionConfig .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a rule using a path condition and a forward action

       The following create-rule example creates a rule that forwards requests
       to  the  specified  target group if the URL contains the specified pat-
       tern.

          aws elbv2 create-rule \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/f2f7dc8efc522ab2 \

       Example 2: To create a rule using a host condition and a fixed response

       The following create-rule example creates a rule that provides a  fixed
       response if the hostname in the host header matches the specified host-
       name.

          aws elbv2 create-rule \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/f2f7dc8efc522ab2 \

       Example 3: To create a rule using a source IP address condition, an au-
       thenticate action, and a forward action

       The following create-rule example creates a rule that authenticates the
       user if the source IP address matches the  specified  IP  address,  and
       forwards the request to the specified target group if authentication is
       successful.

                        host-header or path-pattern . Alternatively, to  spec-
                        ify multiple host names or multiple path patterns, use
                        HostHeaderConfig or PathPatternConfig .

                        If Field is host-header and you are  not  using  Host-
                        HeaderConfig , you can specify a single host name (for
                        example, my.example.com) in Values . A  host  name  is
                        case  insensitive,  can  be  up  to  128 characters in
                        length, and can contain any of the  following  charac-
                        ters.

                        o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                        o

                          o .

                        o

                          o (matches 0 or more characters)

                        o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                        If  Field  is path-pattern and you are not using Path-
                        PatternConfig , you can specify a single path  pattern
                        (for example, /img/
                        *
                        ) in Values . A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be
                        up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of
                        the following characters.

                        (string)

                     HostHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a host header condition. Specify  only
                        when Field is host-header .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more host names. The maximum size of each
                            name is 128 characters. The comparison is case in-
                            sensitive.  The  following wildcard characters are
                            supported: * (matches 0 or more characters) and  ?
                            (matches exactly 1 character).

                            If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is
                            satisfied if one of the strings matches  the  host
                            name.

                            (string)

                     PathPatternConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a path pattern condition. Specify only
                        when Field is path-pattern .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more path patterns to compare  against  the
                            request  URL.  The  maximum size of each string is
                            128 characters. The comparison is case  sensitive.
                            The following wildcard characters are supported: *
                            (matches 0 or more characters) and ? (matches  ex-
                            actly 1 character).

                            If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is
                            satisfied if one of them matches the request  URL.
                            The  path  pattern is compared only to the path of
                            the URL, not  to  its  query  string.  To  compare
                            against  the  query string, use  QueryStringCondi-
                            tionConfig .

                            (string)

                     HttpHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP header condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-header .

                        HttpHeaderName -> (string)
                            The  name  of  the  HTTP header field. The maximum
                            size is 40 characters. The header name is case in-
                            sensitive. The allowed characters are specified by
                            RFC 7230. Wildcards are not supported.

                            You can't use an HTTP header condition to  specify
                            the host header. Use  HostHeaderConditionConfig to
                            specify a host header condition.

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more strings to compare against  the  value
                            of  the  HTTP  header.  The  maximum  size of each
                            string is 128 characters. The  comparison  strings
                            are case insensitive. The following wildcard char-
                            acters are supported: * (matches 0 or more charac-
                            ters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                            If  the  same header appears multiple times in the
                            request, we search them in order until a match  is
                            found.

                            If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is
                            satisfied if one of the strings matches the  value
                            of  the  HTTP  header.  To require that all of the
                            strings are a  match,  create  one  condition  per
                            string.

                            (string)

                     QueryStringConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a query string condition. Specify only
                        when Field is query-string .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more key/value pairs or values to  find  in
                            the  query string. The maximum size of each string
                            is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensi-
                            tive.  The  following wildcard characters are sup-
                            ported: * (matches 0 or  more  characters)  and  ?
                            (matches  exactly  1  character).  To search for a
                            literal '*' or '?' character in  a  query  string,
                            you must escape these characters in Values using a
                            '' character.

                            If you specify multiple key/value pairs or values,
                            the condition is satisfied if one of them is found
                            in the query string.

                            (structure)
                               Information about a key/value pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The key. You can omit the key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value.

                     HttpRequestMethodConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP method condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-request-method .

                        Values -> (list)
                            The  name  of the request method. The maximum size
                            is 40 characters. The allowed characters are  A-Z,
                            hyphen  (-), and underscore (_). The comparison is
                            case  sensitive.  Wildcards  are  not   supported;
                            therefore, the method name must be an exact match.

                            If  you specify multiple strings, the condition is
                            satisfied if one of the strings matches  the  HTTP
                            request  method.  We  recommend that you route GET
                            and HEAD requests in the same way, because the re-
                            sponse to a HEAD request may be cached.

                            (string)

                     SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
                        Information  for  a  source IP condition. Specify only
                        when Field is source-ip .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more source IP addresses, in  CIDR  format.
                            You  can  use  both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Wild-
                            cards are not supported.

                            If you specify multiple addresses,  the  condition
                            is  satisfied  if the source IP address of the re-
                            quest matches one of the CIDR blocks. This  condi-
                            tion  is  not  satisfied  by  the addresses in the
                            X-Forwarded-For header. To search for addresses in
                            the  X-Forwarded-For header, use  HttpHeaderCondi-
                            tionConfig .

                 (structure)
                     Information about an action.

                     Each rule must include exactly one of the following types
                     of  actions: forward , fixed-response , or redirect , and
                     it must be the last action to be performed.

                     Type -> (string)

                        Specify  only  when  Type  is  forward and you want to
                        route to a single target group. To  route  to  one  or
                        more target groups, use ForwardConfig instead.

                        ClientId -> (string)
                            The OAuth 2.0 client identifier.

                        ClientSecret -> (string)
                            The OAuth 2.0 client secret. This parameter is re-
                            quired if you are creating a rule. If you are mod-
                            ifying  a rule, you can omit this parameter if you
                            set UseExistingClientSecret to true.

                            IdP. The default is openid .

                            To verify which scope values your IdP supports and
                            how to separate multiple values, see the  documen-
                            tation for your IdP.
