DESCRIBE-RULES()                                              DESCRIBE-RULES()



NAME
       describe-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the specified rules or the rules for the specified listener.
       You must specify either a listener or one or more rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-rules is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Rules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-rules
          [--listener-arn <value>]
          [--rule-arns <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --rule-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe a rule

       The following describe-rules example displays details for the specified
       rule.

          aws elbv2 describe-rules \
              --rule-arns arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener-rule/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/f2f7dc8efc522ab2/9683b2d02a6cabee

       Example 2: To describe the rules for a listener

       The following describe-rules example displays details for the rules for
       the specified listener. The output includes the default  rule  and  any
       other rules that you've added.

          aws elbv2 describe-rules \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:listener/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188/f2f7dc8efc522ab2

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          Information about the rules.

          (structure)
              Information about a rule.

              RuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

              Priority -> (string)
                 The priority.

              Conditions -> (list)
                 The conditions. Each rule can include zero or one of the fol-
                 lowing  conditions:  http-request-method  ,   host-header   ,
                 path-pattern  ,  and source-ip , and zero or more of the fol-
                 lowing conditions: http-header and query-string .

                 (structure)
                     Information about a condition for a rule.

                     Each rule can optionally include up to one of each of the
                     following conditions: http-request-method , host-header ,
                     path-pattern , and source-ip . Each rule can also option-
                     ally  include one or more of each of the following condi-
                     tions: http-header and query-string . Note that the value
                     for a condition cannot be empty.

                     Field -> (string)
                        The  field  in the HTTP request. The following are the
                        possible values:

                        o http-header

                        o http-request-method

                        o host-header

                        o path-pattern

                        o query-string

                        o source-ip

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  condition  value.  Specify  only  when  Field  is
                        host-header  or path-pattern . Alternatively, to spec-
                        ify multiple host names or multiple path patterns, use
                        HostHeaderConfig or PathPatternConfig .

                        If  Field  is  host-header and you are not using Host-
                        HeaderConfig , you can specify a single host name (for
                        example,  my.example.com)  in  Values . A host name is
                        case insensitive, can  be  up  to  128  characters  in
                        length,  and  can contain any of the following charac-
                        ters.

                        o A-Z, a-z, 0-9

                        o

                          o .

                        o

                          o (matches 0 or more characters)

                        o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                        If Field is path-pattern and you are not  using  Path-
                        PatternConfig  , you can specify a single path pattern
                        (for example, /img/
                        *
                        ) in Values . A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be
                        up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of
                        the following characters.

                          o (matches 0 or more characters)

                        o ? (matches exactly 1 character)

                        (string)

                     HostHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                        Information  for a host header condition. Specify only
                        when Field is host-header .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One or more host names. The maximum size  of  each
                            name is 128 characters. The comparison is case in-
                            sensitive. The following wildcard  characters  are
                            supported:  * (matches 0 or more characters) and ?
                            (matches exactly 1 character).

                            If you specify multiple strings, the condition  is
                            satisfied  if  one of the strings matches the host
                            name.

                            (string)

                     PathPatternConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a path pattern condition. Specify only
                        when Field is path-pattern .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more path patterns to compare against the
                            request URL. The maximum size of  each  string  is
                            128  characters. The comparison is case sensitive.
                            The following wildcard characters are supported: *
                            (matches  0 or more characters) and ? (matches ex-
                            actly 1 character).

                            If you specify multiple strings, the condition  is
                            satisfied  if one of them matches the request URL.
                            The path pattern is compared only to the  path  of
                            the  URL,  not  to  its  query  string. To compare
                            against the query string,  use   QueryStringCondi-
                            tionConfig .

                            (string)

                     HttpHeaderConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP header condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-header .

                        HttpHeaderName -> (string)
                            The name of the HTTP  header  field.  The  maximum
                            size is 40 characters. The header name is case in-
                            sensitive. The allowed characters are specified by
                            RFC 7230. Wildcards are not supported.

                            You  can't use an HTTP header condition to specify
                            the host header. Use  HostHeaderConditionConfig to
                            specify a host header condition.

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more strings to compare against the value
                            of the HTTP  header.  The  maximum  size  of  each
                            string  is  128 characters. The comparison strings
                            are case insensitive. The following wildcard char-
                            acters are supported: * (matches 0 or more charac-
                            ters) and ? (matches exactly 1 character).

                            If the same header appears multiple times  in  the
                            request,  we search them in order until a match is
                            found.

                            If you specify multiple strings, the condition  is
                            satisfied  if one of the strings matches the value
                            of the HTTP header. To require  that  all  of  the
                            strings  are  a  match,  create  one condition per
                            string.

                            (string)

                     QueryStringConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a query string condition. Specify only
                        when Field is query-string .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more key/value pairs or values to find in
                            the query string. The maximum size of each  string
                            is 128 characters. The comparison is case insensi-
                            tive. The following wildcard characters  are  sup-
                            ported:  *  (matches  0  or more characters) and ?
                            (matches exactly 1 character).  To  search  for  a
                            literal  '*'  or  '?' character in a query string,
                            you must escape these characters in Values using a
                            '' character.

                            If you specify multiple key/value pairs or values,
                            the condition is satisfied if one of them is found
                            in the query string.

                            (structure)
                               Information about a key/value pair.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The key. You can omit the key.

                               Value -> (string)
                                   The value.

                     HttpRequestMethodConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for an HTTP method condition. Specify only
                        when Field is http-request-method .

                        Values -> (list)
                            The name of the request method. The  maximum  size
                            is  40 characters. The allowed characters are A-Z,
                            hyphen (-), and underscore (_). The comparison  is
                            case   sensitive.  Wildcards  are  not  supported;
                            therefore, the method name must be an exact match.

                            If you specify multiple strings, the condition  is
                            satisfied  if  one of the strings matches the HTTP
                            request method. We recommend that  you  route  GET
                            and HEAD requests in the same way, because the re-
                            sponse to a HEAD request may be cached.

                            (string)

                     SourceIpConfig -> (structure)
                        Information for a source IP  condition.  Specify  only
                        when Field is source-ip .

                        Values -> (list)
                            One  or  more source IP addresses, in CIDR format.
                            You can use both IPv4 and  IPv6  addresses.  Wild-
                            cards are not supported.

                            If  you  specify multiple addresses, the condition
                            is satisfied if the source IP address of  the  re-
                            quest  matches one of the CIDR blocks. This condi-
                            tion is not satisfied  by  the  addresses  in  the
                            X-Forwarded-For header. To search for addresses in
                            the X-Forwarded-For header, use   HttpHeaderCondi-
                            tionConfig .

                            (string)

              Actions -> (list)
                 The  actions.  Each rule must include exactly one of the fol-
                 lowing types of actions: forward , redirect  ,  or  fixed-re-
                 sponse , and it must be the last action to be performed.

                 (structure)
