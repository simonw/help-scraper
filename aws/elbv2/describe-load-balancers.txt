DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()                            DESCRIBE-LOAD-BALANCERS()



NAME
       describe-load-balancers -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified load balancers or all of your load balancers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-load-balancers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: LoadBalancers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-balancers
          [--load-balancer-arns <value>]
          [--names <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARN) of the load balancers. You can spec-
          ify up to 20 load balancers in a single call.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --names (list)
          The names of the load balancers.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe all load balancers

       This example describes all of your load balancers.

       Command:

          aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers

OUTPUT
       LoadBalancers -> (list)
          Information about the load balancers.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer.

              LoadBalancerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

              DNSName -> (string)
                 The public DNS name of the load balancer.

              CanonicalHostedZoneId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone associated with the
                 load balancer.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the load balancer was created.

              LoadBalancerName -> (string)
                 The name of the load balancer.

              Scheme -> (string)
                 The  nodes of an Internet-facing load balancer have public IP
                 addresses. The DNS name of an Internet-facing  load  balancer
                 is  publicly  resolvable  to  the  public IP addresses of the
                 nodes. Therefore, Internet-facing load  balancers  can  route
                 requests from clients over the internet.

                 The  nodes  of an internal load balancer have only private IP
                 addresses. The DNS name of an internal load balancer is  pub-
                 licly  resolvable  to  the private IP addresses of the nodes.
                 Therefore, internal load balancers can  route  requests  only
                 from clients with access to the VPC for the load balancer.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC for the load balancer.

              State -> (structure)
                 The state of the load balancer.

                 Code -> (string)
                     The state code. The initial state of the load balancer is
                     provisioning . After the load balancer is  fully  set  up
                     and ready to route traffic, its state is active . If load
                     balancer is routing traffic but does  not  have  the  re-
                     sources  it  needs  to  scale,  its  state is``active_im-
                     paired`` . If the load balancer could not be set up,  its
                     state is failed .

                 Reason -> (string)
                     A description of the state.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of load balancer.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 The subnets for the load balancer.

                 (structure)
                     Information about an Availability Zone.

                     ZoneName -> (string)
                        The name of the Availability Zone.

                     SubnetId -> (string)
                        The  ID  of the subnet. You can specify one subnet per
                        Availability Zone.

                     OutpostId -> (string)
                        [Application Load Balancers on Outposts] The ID of the
                        Outpost.

                     LoadBalancerAddresses -> (list)
                        [Network  Load  Balancers]  If  you need static IP ad-
                        dresses for your load balancer, you  can  specify  one
                        Elastic IP address per Availability Zone when you cre-
                        ate an internal-facing  load  balancer.  For  internal
                        load  balancers,  you can specify a private IP address
                        from the IPv4 range of the subnet.

                        (structure)
                            Information about a static IP address for  a  load
                            balancer.

                            IpAddress -> (string)
                               The static IP address.

                            AllocationId -> (string)
                               [Network  Load  Balancers] The allocation ID of
                               the Elastic IP address for  an  internal-facing
                               load balancer.
