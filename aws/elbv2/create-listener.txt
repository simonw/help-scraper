CREATE-LISTENER()                                            CREATE-LISTENER()



NAME
       create-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a listener for the specified Application Load Balancer, Network
       Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer.

       For more information, see the following:

       o Listeners for your Application Load Balancers

       o Listeners for your Network Load Balancers

       o Listeners for your Gateway Load Balancers

       This operation is idempotent, which means that it completes at most one
       time.  If  you  attempt to create multiple listeners with the same set-
       tings, each call succeeds.

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol for connections from clients to the load balancer.  For
          Application  Load  Balancers,  the  supported protocols are HTTP and
          HTTPS. For Network Load Balancers, the supported protocols are  TCP,
          TLS,  UDP, and TCP_UDP. You cant specify the UDP or TCP_UDP protocol
          if dual-stack mode is enabled. You cannot specify a protocol  for  a
          Gateway Load Balancer.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

          o TCP

          o TLS

          o UDP

          o TCP_UDP

          o GENEVE

       --port (integer)
          The port on which the load balancer is listening. You cannot specify
          a port for a Gateway Load Balancer.

       --ssl-policy (string)
          [HTTPS and TLS listeners] The security  policy  that  defines  which
          protocols and ciphers are supported.

          For  more information, see Security policies in the Application Load
          Balancers Guide and Security policies in the Network Load  Balancers
          Guide .

       --certificates (list)
          [HTTPS  and TLS listeners] The default certificate for the listener.
          You must provide exactly one certificate. Set CertificateArn to  the
          certificate ARN but do not set IsDefault .

              Information about an SSL server certificate.

              CertificateArn -> (string)

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate is the default certificate.
                 Do not set this value when specifying a certificate as an in-
                 put. This value is not included in the output when describing
                 a listener, but is included when describing listener certifi-
                 cates.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create an HTTP listener

       The following create-listener example creates an HTTP listener for  the
       specified Application Load Balancer that forwards requests to the spec-
       ified target group.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \

       specified Network Load Balancer that forwards requests to the specified
       target group. You must specify an SSL certificate for a TLS listener.

          aws elbv2 create-listener \
              --load-balancer-arn arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-west-2:123456789012:loadbalancer/app/my-load-balancer/50dc6c495c0c9188 \
              --protocol TLS \
              --port 443 \
              --certificates CertificateArn=arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/3dcb0a41-bd72-4774-9ad9-756919c40557 \
