OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --attributes (list)
          The load balancer attributes.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attributes are supported by all load balancers:

                 o deletion_protection.enabled -  Indicates  whether  deletion
                   protection is enabled. The value is true or false . The de-
                   fault is false .

                 o load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled   -   Indicates   whether
                   cross-zone  load  balancing is enabled. The possible values
                   are true and false . The default for Network Load Balancers
                   and  Gateway  Load Balancers is false . The default for Ap-
                   plication Load Balancers is true , and can't be changed.

                 The following attributes are supported  by  both  Application
                 Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

                 o access_logs.s3.enabled  - Indicates whether access logs are
                   enabled. The value is true or false . The default is  false
                   .

                 o access_logs.s3.bucket  -  The name of the S3 bucket for the
                   access logs. This attribute is required if access logs  are
                   enabled.  The  bucket  must exist in the same region as the
                   load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants  Elastic
                   Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

                 o access_logs.s3.prefix  - The prefix for the location in the
                   S3 bucket for the access logs.

                 o ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic - Blocks internet  gateway  (IGW)
                   access  to the load balancer. It is set to false for inter-
                   net-facing load balancers and true for internal  load  bal-
                   ancers,  preventing unintended access to your internal load
                   balancer through an internet gateway.

                 o zonal_shift.config.enabled - Indicates whether zonal  shift
                   is  enabled.  The  possible values are true and false . The
                   default is false .

                 The following attributes are supported  by  only  Application
                 Load Balancers:

                   seconds. The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default  is
                   60 seconds.

                 o client_keep_alive.seconds - The client keep alive value, in
                   seconds. The valid range is 60-604800 seconds. The  default
                   is 3600 seconds.

                 o connection_logs.s3.enabled  -  Indicates whether connection
                   logs are enabled. The value is true or false . The  default
                   is false .

                 o connection_logs.s3.bucket  -  The name of the S3 bucket for
                   the connection logs. This attribute is required if  connec-
                   tion  logs  are  enabled. The bucket must exist in the same
                   region as the load balancer and have a bucket  policy  that
                   grants  Elastic  Load Balancing permissions to write to the
                   bucket.

                 o connection_logs.s3.prefix - The prefix for the location  in
                   the S3 bucket for the connection logs.

                   load balancer handles requests that might pose  a  security
                   risk to your application. The possible values are monitor ,
                   defensive , and strictest . The default is defensive .

                 o routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled - Indicates
                   whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed
                   by the load balancer (true ) or routed to targets (false ).
                   The default is false .

                 o routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled    -    Indicates
                   whether the Application Load Balancer should  preserve  the
                   Host  header  in the HTTP request and send it to the target
                   without any change. The possible values are true and  false
                   . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled  -
                   Indicates whether the two headers  (x-amzn-tls-version  and
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite  ), which contain information about
                   the negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are  added  to
                   the  client  request  before  sending it to the target. The
                   x-amzn-tls-version header has  information  about  the  TLS
                   protocol  version  negotiated  with  the  client,  and  the
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite header has  information  about  the
                   cipher  suite  negotiated with the client. Both headers are
                   in OpenSSL format. The possible values  for  the  attribute
                   are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled  -  Indicates  whether
                   the X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source  port
                   that  the  client used to connect to the load balancer. The
                   possible values are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_header_processing.mode -  Enables  you  to
                   modify,  preserve,  or remove the X-Forwarded-For header in
                   the HTTP request before the Application Load Balancer sends
                   the request to the target. The possible values are append ,
                   preserve , and remove . The default is append .

                   o If the value is append , the  Application  Load  Balancer
                     adds  the  client  IP  address  (of  the last hop) to the
                     X-Forwarded-For header in  the  HTTP  request  before  it
                     sends it to targets.

                   o If  the  value  is preserve the Application Load Balancer
                     preserves the X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP request,
                     and sends it to targets without any change.

                   o If  the  value  is remove , the Application Load Balancer
                     removes the X-Forwarded-For header in  the  HTTP  request
                     before it sends it to targets.

                 o routing.http2.enabled  -  Indicates  whether  HTTP/2 is en-
                   abled. The possible values are true and false . The default
                   is  true  .  Elastic  Load  Balancing requires that message
                   header names contain only alphanumeric characters  and  hy-
                   phens.

                 o waf.fail_open.enabled   -  Indicates  whether  to  allow  a
                   WAF-enabled load balancer to route requests to  targets  if
                   it  is unable to forward the request to Amazon Web Services
                   WAF. The possible values are true and false .  The  default
                   is false .

                 The  following  attributes are supported by only Network Load
                 Balancers:

                 o dns_record.client_routing_policy - Indicates how traffic is
                   distributed among the load balancer Availability Zones. The
                   possible values  are  availability_zone_affinity  with  100
                   percent  zonal affinity, partial_availability_zone_affinity
                   with 85 percent zonal affinity,  and  any_availability_zone
                   with 0 percent zonal affinity.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To enable deletion protection

       This example enables deletion protection for the  specified  load  bal-
       ancer.

          }

       To enable access logs

       This example enables access logs for the specified load balancer.  Note
       that  the  S3 bucket must exist in the same region as the load balancer
       and must have a policy attached that grants access to the Elastic  Load
       Balancing service.

                 o access_logs.s3.enabled - Indicates whether access logs  are
                   enabled.  The value is true or false . The default is false
                   .

                 o access_logs.s3.bucket - The name of the S3 bucket  for  the
                   access  logs. This attribute is required if access logs are
                   enabled. The bucket must exist in the same  region  as  the
                   load  balancer and have a bucket policy that grants Elastic
                   Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

                 o access_logs.s3.prefix - The prefix for the location in  the
                   S3 bucket for the access logs.

                 o ipv6.deny_all_igw_traffic  -  Blocks internet gateway (IGW)
                   access to the load balancer. It is set to false for  inter-
                   net-facing  load  balancers and true for internal load bal-
                   ancers, preventing unintended access to your internal  load
                   balancer through an internet gateway.

                 o zonal_shift.config.enabled  - Indicates whether zonal shift
                   is enabled. The possible values are true and  false  .  The
                   default is false .

                 The  following  attributes  are supported by only Application
                 Load Balancers:

                 o idle_timeout.timeout_seconds - The idle timeout  value,  in
                   seconds.  The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default is
                   60 seconds.

                 o client_keep_alive.seconds - The client keep alive value, in
                   seconds.  The valid range is 60-604800 seconds. The default
                   is 3600 seconds.

                 o connection_logs.s3.enabled - Indicates  whether  connection
                   logs  are enabled. The value is true or false . The default
                   is false .

                 o connection_logs.s3.bucket - The name of the S3  bucket  for
                   the  connection logs. This attribute is required if connec-
                   tion logs are enabled. The bucket must exist  in  the  same
                   region  as  the load balancer and have a bucket policy that
                   grants Elastic Load Balancing permissions to write  to  the
                   bucket.

                 o connection_logs.s3.prefix  - The prefix for the location in
                   the S3 bucket for the connection logs.

                 o routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode -  Determines  how  the
                   load  balancer  handles requests that might pose a security
                   risk to your application. The possible values are monitor ,
                   defensive , and strictest . The default is defensive .

                 o routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled - Indicates
                   whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed
                   by the load balancer (true ) or routed to targets (false ).
                   The default is false .

                 o routing.http.preserve_host_header.enabled    -    Indicates
                   whether  the  Application Load Balancer should preserve the
                   Host header in the HTTP request and send it to  the  target
                   without  any change. The possible values are true and false
                   . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled  -
                   Indicates  whether  the two headers (x-amzn-tls-version and
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite ), which contain information  about
                   the  negotiated  TLS version and cipher suite, are added to
                   the client request before sending it  to  the  target.  The
                   x-amzn-tls-version  header  has  information  about the TLS
                   protocol  version  negotiated  with  the  client,  and  the
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite  header  has  information about the
                   cipher suite negotiated with the client. Both  headers  are
                   in  OpenSSL  format.  The possible values for the attribute
                   are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled  -  Indicates  whether
                   the  X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source port
                   that the client used to connect to the load  balancer.  The
                   possible values are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_header_processing.mode  -  Enables  you to
                   modify, preserve, or remove the X-Forwarded-For  header  in
                   the HTTP request before the Application Load Balancer sends
                   the request to the target. The possible values are append ,
                   preserve , and remove . The default is append .

                   o If  the  value  is append , the Application Load Balancer
                     adds the client IP address  (of  the  last  hop)  to  the
                     X-Forwarded-For  header  in  the  HTTP  request before it
                     sends it to targets.

                   o If the value is preserve the  Application  Load  Balancer
                     preserves the X-Forwarded-For header in the HTTP request,
                     and sends it to targets without any change.

                   o If the value is remove , the  Application  Load  Balancer
                     removes  the  X-Forwarded-For  header in the HTTP request
                     before it sends it to targets.

                 o routing.http2.enabled - Indicates  whether  HTTP/2  is  en-
                   abled. The possible values are true and false . The default
                   is true . Elastic  Load  Balancing  requires  that  message
                   header  names  contain only alphanumeric characters and hy-
                   phens.

                 o waf.fail_open.enabled  -  Indicates  whether  to  allow   a
                   WAF-enabled  load  balancer to route requests to targets if
                   it is unable to forward the request to Amazon Web  Services
                   WAF.  The  possible values are true and false . The default
                   is false .

                 The following attributes are supported by only  Network  Load
                 Balancers:

                 o dns_record.client_routing_policy - Indicates how traffic is
                   distributed among the load balancer Availability Zones. The
                   possible  values  are  availability_zone_affinity  with 100
                   percent zonal affinity,  partial_availability_zone_affinity
                   with  85  percent zonal affinity, and any_availability_zone
                   with 0 percent zonal affinity.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.
