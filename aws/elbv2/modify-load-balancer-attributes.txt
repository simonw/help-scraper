NAME
       modify-load-balancer-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the  specified  attributes  of the specified Application Load
       Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Gateway Load Balancer.

       If any of the specified attributes can't be modified as requested,  the
       call fails. Any existing attributes that you do not modify retain their
       current values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-load-balancer-attributes
          --load-balancer-arn <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --load-balancer-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the load balancer.

       --attributes (list)
          The load balancer attributes.

          (structure)
              Information about a load balancer attribute.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute.

                 The following attribute is supported by all load balancers:

                 o deletion_protection.enabled -  Indicates  whether  deletion
                   protection is enabled. The value is true or false . The de-
                   fault is false .

                 The following attributes are supported  by  both  Application
                 Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers:

                 o access_logs.s3.enabled  - Indicates whether access logs are
                   enabled. The value is true or false . The default is  false
                   .

                 o access_logs.s3.bucket  -  The name of the S3 bucket for the
                   access logs. This attribute is required if access logs  are
                   enabled.  The  bucket  must exist in the same region as the
                   load balancer and have a bucket policy that grants  Elastic
                   Load Balancing permissions to write to the bucket.

                 o access_logs.s3.prefix  - The prefix for the location in the
                   S3 bucket for the access logs.

                 o ipv6.deny-all-igw-traffic - Blocks internet  gateway  (IGW)
                   access  to the load balancer. It is set to false for inter-
                   net-facing load balancers and true for internal  load  bal-
                   ancers,  preventing unintended access to your internal load
                   balancer through an internet gateway.

                 The following attributes are supported  by  only  Application
                 Load Balancers:

                 o idle_timeout.timeout_seconds  -  The idle timeout value, in
                   seconds. The valid range is 1-4000 seconds. The default  is
                   60 seconds.

                 o routing.http.desync_mitigation_mode  -  Determines  how the
                   load balancer handles requests that might pose  a  security
                   risk to your application. The possible values are monitor ,
                   defensive , and strictest . The default is defensive .

                 o routing.http.drop_invalid_header_fields.enabled - Indicates
                   whether HTTP headers with invalid header fields are removed
                   by the load balancer (true ) or routed to targets (false ).
                   The default is false .

                 o routing.http.x_amzn_tls_version_and_cipher_suite.enabled  -
                   Indicates whether the two headers  (x-amzn-tls-version  and
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite  ), which contain information about
                   the negotiated TLS version and cipher suite, are  added  to
                   the  client  request  before  sending it to the target. The
                   x-amzn-tls-version header has  information  about  the  TLS
                   protocol  version  negotiated  with  the  client,  and  the
                   x-amzn-tls-cipher-suite header has  information  about  the
                   cipher  suite  negotiated with the client. Both headers are
                   in OpenSSL format. The possible values  for  the  attribute
                   are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http.xff_client_port.enabled  -  Indicates  whether
                   the X-Forwarded-For header should preserve the source  port
                   that  the  client used to connect to the load balancer. The
                   possible values are true and false . The default is false .

                 o routing.http2.enabled - Indicates  whether  HTTP/2  is  en-
                   abled. The possible values are true and false . The default
                   is true . Elastic  Load  Balancing  requires  that  message
                   header  names  contain only alphanumeric characters and hy-
                   phens.

                 o waf.fail_open.enabled  -  Indicates  whether  to  allow   a
                   WAF-enabled  load  balancer to route requests to targets if
                   it is unable to forward the request to Amazon Web  Services
                   WAF.  The  possible values are true and false . The default
                   is false .

                 The following attribute is supported  by  Network  Load  Bal-
                 ancers and Gateway Load Balancers:

                 o load_balancing.cross_zone.enabled   -   Indicates   whether
                   cross-zone load balancing is enabled. The  possible  values
                   are true and false . The default is false .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the attribute.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       To change the idle timeout

       This example changes the idle timeout value for the specified load bal-
       ancer.

       Command:

       Output:

          {
            "Attributes": [
                {
                    "Value": "30",

            ]
          }

       To enable access logs

       This  example enables access logs for the specified load balancer. Note
       that the S3 bucket must exist in the same region as the  load  balancer
       and  must have a policy attached that grants access to the Elastic Load
       Balancing service.
