MODIFY-LISTENER()                                            MODIFY-LISTENER()



NAME
       modify-listener -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces  the specified properties of the specified listener. Any prop-
       erties that you do not specify remain unchanged.

       Changing the protocol from HTTPS to HTTP, or from TLS to  TCP,  removes
       the  security  policy and default certificate properties. If you change
       the protocol from HTTP to HTTPS, or from TCP to TLS, you must  add  the
       security policy and default certificate properties.

       To add an item to a list, remove an item from a list, or update an item
       in a list, you must provide the entire list. For example, to add an ac-
       tion, specify a list with the current actions plus the new action.

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --port (integer)
          The port for connections from clients to the load balancer. You can-
          not specify a port for a Gateway Load Balancer.

       --protocol (string)
          The protocol for connections from clients to the load balancer.  Ap-
          plication  Load Balancers support the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Net-
          work Load Balancers support the TCP, TLS, UDP,  and  TCP_UDP  proto-
          cols.  You  cant change the protocol to UDP or TCP_UDP if dual-stack
          mode is enabled. You cannot specify a protocol for  a  Gateway  Load
          Balancer.

          Possible values:

          o HTTP

          o HTTPS

          o TCP

          o TLS

          o UDP

          o TCP_UDP

          o GENEVE

       --ssl-policy (string)
          [HTTPS  and  TLS  listeners]  The security policy that defines which
          protocols and ciphers are supported.

          For more information, see Security policies in the Application  Load
          Balancers  Guide  or Security policies in the Network Load Balancers
          Guide .

       --certificates (list)
          [HTTPS and TLS listeners] The default certificate for the  listener.
          You  must provide exactly one certificate. Set CertificateArn to the
          certificate ARN but do not set IsDefault .

              Information about an SSL server certificate.

              CertificateArn -> (string)

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate is the default certificate.
                 Do not set this value when specifying a certificate as an in-
                 put. This value is not included in the output when describing
                 a listener, but is included when describing listener certifi-
                 cates.

       --alpn-policy (list)
          [TLS listeners] The name of the Application-Layer Protocol  Negotia-
          tion  (ALPN)  policy. You can specify one policy name. The following
          are the possible values:

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
