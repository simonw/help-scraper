CREATE-MOUNT-TARGET()                                    CREATE-MOUNT-TARGET()



NAME
       create-mount-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  mount target for a file system. You can then mount the file
       system on EC2 instances by using the mount target.

       You can create one mount target in each Availability Zone in your  VPC.
       All  EC2  instances  in  a VPC within a given Availability Zone share a
       single mount target for a given file system. If you have multiple  sub-
       nets  in  an Availability Zone, you create a mount target in one of the
       subnets. EC2 instances do not need to be in  the  same  subnet  as  the
       mount target in order to access their file system.

       You  can  create only one mount target for an EFS file system using One
       Zone storage classes. You must create that mount  target  in  the  same
       Availability  Zone  in which the file system is located. Use the Avail-
       abilityZoneName  and   AvailabiltyZoneId   properties   in   the    De-
       scribeFileSystems response object to get this information. Use the sub-
       netId associated with the file system's Availability Zone when creating
       the mount target.

       For more information, see Amazon EFS: How it Works .

       To create a mount target for a file system, the file system's lifecycle
       state must be available . For more information,  see   DescribeFileSys-
       tems .

       In the request, provide the following:

       o The file system ID for which you are creating the mount target.

       o A subnet ID, which determines the following:

         o The VPC in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

         o The Availability Zone in which Amazon EFS creates the mount target

         o The  IP  address range from which Amazon EFS selects the IP address
           of the mount target (if you don't specify an IP address in the  re-
           quest)

       After creating the mount target, Amazon EFS returns a response that in-
       cludes, a MountTargetId and an IpAddress . You use this IP address when
       mounting the file system in an EC2 instance. You can also use the mount
       target's DNS name when mounting the file system. The  EC2  instance  on
       which  you  mount the file system by using the mount target can resolve
       the mount target's DNS name to its IP address.  For  more  information,
       see How it Works: Implementation Overview .

       Note  that  you  can create mount targets for a file system in only one
       VPC, and there can be only one mount target per Availability Zone. That
       is,  if  the  file system already has one or more mount targets created
       for it, the subnet specified in the request to add another mount target
       must meet the following requirements:

       o Must belong to the same VPC as the subnets of the existing mount tar-
         gets

       o Must not be in the same Availability Zone as any of  the  subnets  of
         the existing mount targets

       If  the request satisfies the requirements, Amazon EFS does the follow-
       ing:

       o Creates a new mount target in the specified subnet.

       o Also creates a new network interface in the subnet as follows:

         o If the request provides an IpAddress , Amazon EFS assigns  that  IP
           address  to  the network interface. Otherwise, Amazon EFS assigns a
           free address in the subnet (in the same way  that  the  Amazon  EC2
           CreateNetworkInterface  call does when a request does not specify a
           primary private IP address).

         o If the request provides SecurityGroups , this network interface  is
           associated with those security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the
           default security group for the subnet's VPC.

         o Assigns the description Mount  target  *fsmt-id*  for  file  system
           *fs-id*  ``  where  ``  *fsmt-id* `` is the mount target ID, and ``
           *fs-id* `` is the ``FileSystemId .

         o Sets the requesterManaged property of the network interface to true
           , and the requesterId value to EFS .

       Each  Amazon  EFS  mount target has one corresponding requester-managed
       EC2 network interface. After the network interface is  created,  Amazon
       EFS sets the NetworkInterfaceId field in the mount target's description
       to the network interface ID, and the IpAddress field to its address. If
       network  interface  creation fails, the entire CreateMountTarget opera-
       tion fails.

       NOTE:
          The CreateMountTarget call returns only after creating  the  network
          interface,  but while the mount target state is still creating , you
          can check the mount target creation status by calling the  Describe-
          MountTargets  operation,  which among other things returns the mount
          target state.

       We recommend that you create a mount target in each of the Availability
       Zones.  There  are  cost  considerations  for using a file system in an
       Availability Zone through a mount target created in another  Availabil-
       ity Zone. For more information, see Amazon EFS . In addition, by always
       using a mount target local to the  instance's  Availability  Zone,  you
       eliminate a partial failure scenario. If the Availability Zone in which
       your mount target is created goes down, then you can't access your file
       system through that mount target.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for the following action on the
       file system:

       o elasticfilesystem:CreateMountTarget

       This operation also requires permissions for the following  Amazon  EC2
       actions:

       o ec2:DescribeSubnets

       o ec2:DescribeNetworkInterfaces

       o ec2:CreateNetworkInterface

SYNOPSIS
            create-mount-target
          --file-system-id <value>
          --subnet-id <value>
          [--ip-address <value>]
          [--security-groups <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system for which to create the mount target.

       --subnet-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the subnet to add the mount target in. For file systems
          that use One Zone storage classes, use the subnet that is associated
          with the file system's Availability Zone.

       --ip-address (string)
          Valid IPv4 address within the address range of the specified subnet.

       --security-groups (list)
          Up  to  five VPC security group IDs, of the form sg-xxxxxxxx . These
          must be for the same VPC as subnet specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       File System User Guide.

OUTPUT
       OwnerId -> (string)
          Amazon Web Services account ID that owns the resource.

       MountTargetId -> (string)
          System-assigned mount target ID.

       FileSystemId -> (string)
          The ID of the file system for which the mount target is intended.

       SubnetId -> (string)
          The ID of the mount target's subnet.

       LifeCycleState -> (string)
          Lifecycle state of the mount target.

       IpAddress -> (string)
          Address at which the file system can be mounted by using  the  mount
          target.

       NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
          The ID of the network interface that Amazon EFS created when it cre-
          ated the mount target.

       AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The unique and consistent identifier of the Availability  Zone  that
          the  mount  target resides in. For example, use1-az1 is an AZ ID for
          the us-east-1 Region and it has the same location  in  every  Amazon
          Web Services account.

       AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
          The  name  of the Availability Zone in which the mount target is lo-
          cated. Availability Zones are independently mapped to names for each
          Amazon  Web  Services  account.  For  example, the Availability Zone
          us-east-1a for your Amazon Web Services account  might  not  be  the
          same location as us-east-1a for another Amazon Web Services account.

       VpcId -> (string)
          The  virtual private cloud (VPC) ID that the mount target is config-
          ured in.
