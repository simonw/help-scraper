NAME
       describe-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  LifecycleConfiguration  object for the specified
       Amazon EFS file system. EFS lifecycle management uses the LifecycleCon-
       figuration object to identify which files to move to the EFS Infrequent
       Access (IA) storage class. For a file system without a LifecycleConfig-
       uration object, the call returns an empty array in the response.

       When  EFS  Intelligent-Tiering  is enabled, TransitionToPrimaryStorage-
       Class has a value of AFTER_1_ACCESS .

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeLifecycleConfiguration operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-lifecycle-configuration
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the file system whose LifecycleConfiguration object you
          want to retrieve (String).

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LifecyclePolicies -> (list)
          An array of lifecycle management policies. EFS supports a maximum of
          one policy per file system.

          (structure)
              Describes a policy used by EFS lifecycle management and EFS  In-
              telligent-Tiering  that  specifies when to transition files into
              and out of the file  system's  Infrequent  Access  (IA)  storage
              class.  For more information, see EFS IntelligentTiering and EFS
              Lifecycle Management .

              NOTE:
                 When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the
                 PutLifecycleConfiguration  API  action,  Amazon  EFS requires
                 that each LifecyclePolicy object have only a  single  transi-
                 tion.  This  means  that in a request body, LifecyclePolicies
                 must be structured as an array  of  LifecyclePolicy  objects,
                 one  object for each transition, TransitionToIA , Transition-
                 ToPrimaryStorageClass . For more information, see the request
                 examples in  PutLifecycleConfiguration .

              TransitionToIA -> (string)
                 Describes the period of time that a file is not accessed, af-
                 ter which it transitions to IA storage.  Metadata  operations
                 such  as  listing  the contents of a directory don't count as
                 file access events.

              TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass -> (string)
                 Describes when to transition a file from IA storage  to  pri-
                 mary  storage.  Metadata  operations such as listing the con-
                 tents of a directory don't count as file access events.
