NAME
       describe-lifecycle-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  LifecycleConfiguration  object for the specified
       Amazon EFS file system. EFS lifecycle management uses the LifecycleCon-
       figuration object to identify which files to move to the EFS Infrequent
       Access (IA) storage class. For a file system without a LifecycleConfig-
       uration object, the call returns an empty array in the response.

       When  EFS  Intelligent  Tiering is enabled, TransitionToPrimaryStorage-
       Class has a value of AFTER_1_ACCESS .

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeLifecycleConfiguration operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-lifecycle-configuration
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the file system whose LifecycleConfiguration object you
          want to retrieve (String).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LifecyclePolicies -> (list)
          An array of lifecycle management policies. EFS supports a maximum of
          one policy per file system.

          (structure)
              Describes  a policy used by EFS lifecycle management and EFS in-
              telligent tiering that specifies when to transition  files  into
              and  out  of  the  file  system's Infrequent Access (IA) storage
              class. For more information, see EFS IntelligentTiering and  EFS
              Lifecycle Management .

              NOTE:
                 When using the put-lifecycle-configuration CLI command or the
                 PutLifecycleConfiguration API  action,  Amazon  EFS  requires
                 that  each  LifecyclePolicy object have only a single transi-
                 tion. This means that in a  request  body,  LifecyclePolicies
                 needs  to  be  structured  as an array of LifecyclePolicy ob-
                 jects, one object for each transition, TransitionToIA , Tran-
                 sitionToPrimaryStorageClass  .  For more information, see the
                 request examples in  PutLifecycleConfiguration .

              TransitionToIA -> (string)
                 Describes the period of time that a file is not accessed, af-
                 ter  which  it transitions to IA storage. Metadata operations
                 such as listing the contents of a directory  don't  count  as
                 file access events.

              TransitionToPrimaryStorageClass -> (string)
                 Describes  when  to transition a file from IA storage to pri-
                 mary storage. Metadata operations such as  listing  the  con-
                 tents of a directory don't count as file access events.
