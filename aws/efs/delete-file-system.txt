DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      DELETE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       delete-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  file  system,  permanently severing access to its contents.
       Upon return, the file system no longer exists and you can't access  any
       contents of the deleted file system.

       You  can't  delete  a  file system that is in use. That is, if the file
       system has any mount targets, you must first delete them. For more  in-
       formation, see  DescribeMountTargets and  DeleteMountTarget .

       NOTE:
          The  DeleteFileSystem  call  returns  while the file system state is
          still deleting . You can check the file system  deletion  status  by
          calling  the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns a list of
          file systems in your account. If you pass file system ID or creation
          token  for the deleted file system, the  DescribeFileSystems returns
          a 404 FileSystemNotFound error.

       This operation requires permissions for  the  elasticfilesystem:Delete-
       FileSystem action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-file-system
          --file-system-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          The ID of the file system you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
