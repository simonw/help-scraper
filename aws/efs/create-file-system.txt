CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM()                                      CREATE-FILE-SYSTEM()



NAME
       create-file-system -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new, empty file system. The operation requires a creation to-
       ken in the request that Amazon EFS uses to ensure  idempotent  creation
       (calling  the  operation  with same creation token has no effect). If a
       file system does not currently exist that is owned by the caller's Ama-
       zon Web Services account with the specified creation token, this opera-
       tion does the following:

       o Creates a new, empty file system. The file system will have an Amazon
         EFS assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state creating .

       o Returns with the description of the created file system.

       Otherwise,  this operation returns a FileSystemAlreadyExists error with
       the ID of the existing file system.

       NOTE:
          For basic use cases, you can use a randomly generated UUID  for  the
          creation token.

       The  idempotent  operation  allows you to retry a CreateFileSystem call
       without risk of creating an extra file system. This can happen when  an
       initial  call  fails in a way that leaves it uncertain whether or not a
       file system was actually created. An example might be that a  transport
       level timeout occurred or your connection was reset. As long as you use
       the same creation token, if the initial call had succeeded in  creating
       a  file system, the client can learn of its existence from the FileSys-
       temAlreadyExists error.

       For more information, see Creating a file system in the Amazon EFS User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          The  CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system's lifecycle
          state is still creating . You can check  the  file  system  creation
          status  by  calling  the  DescribeFileSystems operation, which among
          other things returns the file system state.

       This operation accepts an optional PerformanceMode parameter  that  you
       choose  for  your  file system. We recommend generalPurpose performance
       mode for most file systems. File systems using  the  maxIO  performance
       mode  can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations
       per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for  most  file
       operations. The performance mode can't be changed after the file system
       has been created. For more  information,  see  Amazon  EFS  performance
       modes .

       You  can set the throughput mode for the file system using the Through-
       putMode parameter.

       After the file system is fully created, Amazon EFS sets  its  lifecycle
       state  to  available  , at which point you can create one or more mount
       targets for the file system in your  VPC.  For  more  information,  see
       CreateMountTarget . You mount your Amazon EFS file system on an EC2 in-
       stances in your VPC by using the mount target.  For  more  information,
       see Amazon EFS: How it Works .

       This  operation  requires permissions for the elasticfilesystem:Create-
       FileSystem action.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --creation-token (string)
          A string of up to 64 ASCII characters. Amazon EFS uses this  to  en-
          sure idempotent creation.

       --performance-mode (string)
          The performance mode of the file system. We recommend generalPurpose
          performance mode for most file systems. File systems using the maxIO
          performance  mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput
          and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher  laten-
          cies for most file operations. The performance mode can't be changed
          after the file system has been created.

          NOTE:
              The maxIO mode is not supported on file systems using  One  Zone
              storage classes.

          Possible values:

          o generalPurpose

          o maxIO

       --encrypted | --no-encrypted (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value  that,  if true, creates an encrypted file system.
          When creating an encrypted file system, you have the option of spec-
          ifying  an  existing  Key  Management  Service key (KMS key). If you
          don't specify a KMS key, then the default KMS key  for  Amazon  EFS,
          /aws/elasticfilesystem  , is used to protect the encrypted file sys-
          tem.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key that you want to use to protect the  encrypted
          file  system.  This  parameter is required only if you want to use a
          non-default KMS key. If this parameter is not specified, the default
          KMS  key  for Amazon EFS is used. You can specify a KMS key ID using
          the following formats:

          o Key  ID  -  A  unique  identifier  of   the   key,   for   example
            1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab .

          o ARN  -  An  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) for the key, for example
            arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab
            .

          o Key alias - A previously created display name for a key, for exam-
            ple alias/projectKey1 .

          o Key  alias  ARN  -  An  ARN  for  a   key   alias,   for   example
            arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:444455556666:alias/projectKey1 .

          If  you use KmsKeyId , you must set the  CreateFileSystemRequest$En-
          crypted parameter to true.

          WARNING:
              EFS accepts only symmetric KMS keys. You cannot  use  asymmetric
              KMS keys with Amazon EFS file systems.

       --throughput-mode (string)
          Specifies  the  throughput mode for the file system, either bursting
          or provisioned . If you set ThroughputMode to provisioned , you must
          also set a value for ProvisionedThroughputInMibps . After you create
          the file system, you can decrease your file system's  throughput  in
          Provisioned  Throughput mode or change between the throughput modes,
          as long as its been more than 24 hours since the  last  decrease  or
          throughput   mode  change.  For  more  information,  see  Specifying
          throughput with provisioned mode in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          Default is bursting .

          Possible values:

          o bursting

          o provisioned

       --provisioned-throughput-in-mibps (double)
          The throughput, measured in MiB/s, that you want to provision for  a
          file  system that you're creating. Valid values are 1-1024. Required
          if ThroughputMode is set  to  provisioned  .  The  upper  limit  for
          throughput is 1024 MiB/s. To increase this limit, contact Amazon Web
          Services Support. For more information, see Amazon EFS  quotas  that
          you can increase in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       --availability-zone-name (string)
          Used  to create a file system that uses One Zone storage classes. It
          specifies the Amazon Web Services Availability Zone in which to cre-
          ate the file system. Use the format us-east-1a to specify the Avail-
          ability Zone. For more information about One Zone  storage  classes,
          see Using EFS storage classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              One  Zone  storage classes are not available in all Availability
              Zones in Amazon Web Services Regions where Amazon EFS is  avail-
              able.

       --backup | --no-backup (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  automatic backups are enabled on the file system
          that you are creating. Set the value to  true  to  enable  automatic
          backups.  If you are creating a file system that uses One Zone stor-
          age classes, automatic backups are enabled by default. For more  in-
          formation, see Automatic backups in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

          Default is false . However, if you specify an AvailabilityZoneName ,
          the default is true .

          NOTE:
              Backup is not available in all Amazon Web Services Regions where
              Amazon EFS is available.

       --tags (list)
          Use to create one or more tags associated with the file system. Each
          tag is a user-defined key-value pair. Name your file system on  cre-
          ation  by including a "Key":"Name","Value":"{value}" key-value pair.
          Each key must be unique. For more information,  see  Tagging  Amazon
          Web  Services resources in the Amazon Web Services General Reference
          Guide .

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space,  and  numbers  that  can be represented in UTF-8, and the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key (String). The key can't start with aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an encrypted file system

       The following create-file-system example creates an encrypted file sys-
       tem using the default CMK. It also adds the tag Name=my-file-system.

          aws efs create-file-system \
              --performance-mode generalPurpose \
              --throughput-mode bursting \

OUTPUT
       OwnerId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that created the file system. If the
          file system was created by an IAM user, the parent account to  which
          the user belongs is the owner.

       CreationToken -> (string)
          The opaque string specified in the request.

       FileSystemId -> (string)
          The ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon EFS.

       FileSystemArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the EFS file system, in the for-
          mat  arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:*region*   :*account-id*   :file-sys-
          tem/*file-system-id*  `` . Example with sample data: ``arn:aws:elas-
          ticfilesystem:us-west-2:1111333322228888:file-system/fs-01234567

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that  the  file  system  was  created,  in  seconds  (since
          1970-01-01T00:00:00Z).

       LifeCycleState -> (string)
          The lifecycle phase of the file system.

       Name -> (string)
          You  can  add  tags to a file system, including a Name tag. For more
          information, see  CreateFileSystem . If the file system has  a  Name
          tag, Amazon EFS returns the value in this field.

       NumberOfMountTargets -> (integer)
          The  current  number  of mount targets that the file system has. For
          more information, see  CreateMountTarget .

       SizeInBytes -> (structure)
          The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the  file
          system,  in its Value field, and the time at which that size was de-
          termined in its Timestamp field. The Timestamp value is the  integer
          number  of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. The SizeInBytes value
          doesn't represent the size of a consistent snapshot of the file sys-
          tem, but it is eventually consistent when there are no writes to the
          file system. That is, SizeInBytes represents actual size only if the
          file  system  is  not  modified for a period longer than a couple of
          hours. Otherwise, the value is not the exact size that the file sys-
          tem was at any point in time.

          Value -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              file system.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the size of data, returned in the Value field,
              was determined. The value is the integer number of seconds since
              1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

          ValueInIA -> (long)
              The latest known metered size (in bytes) of data stored  in  the
              Infrequent Access storage class.

          ValueInStandard -> (long)
              The  latest  known metered size (in bytes) of data stored in the
              Standard storage class.

       PerformanceMode -> (string)
          The performance mode of the file system.

       Encrypted -> (boolean)
          A Boolean value that, if true, indicates that the file system is en-
          crypted.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ID of an KMS key used to protect the encrypted file system.

       ThroughputMode -> (string)
          Displays  the  file  system's throughput mode. For more information,
          see Throughput modes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       ProvisionedThroughputInMibps -> (double)
          The amount of provisioned throughput, measured  in  MiB/s,  for  the
          file system. Valid for file systems using ThroughputMode set to pro-
          visioned .

       AvailabilityZoneName -> (string)
          Describes the Amazon Web Services Availability  Zone  in  which  the
          file system is located, and is valid only for file systems using One
          Zone storage classes. For more information, see  Using  EFS  storage
          classes in the Amazon EFS User Guide .

       AvailabilityZoneId -> (string)
          The  unique  and  consistent  identifier of the Availability Zone in
          which the file system's One Zone storage classes exist. For example,
          use1-az1  is  an  Availability  Zone ID for the us-east-1 Amazon Web
          Services Region, and it has the same location in  every  Amazon  Web
          Services account.

       Tags -> (list)
          The  tags  associated with the file system, presented as an array of
          Tag objects.

          (structure)
              A tag is a key-value pair. Allowed characters are letters, white
              space,  and  numbers  that  can be represented in UTF-8, and the
              following characters:+ - = . _ : / .

              Key -> (string)
