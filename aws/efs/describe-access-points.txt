DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()                              DESCRIBE-ACCESS-POINTS()



NAME
       describe-access-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of a specific Amazon EFS access point if the
       AccessPointId is provided. If you provide an EFS FileSystemId , it  re-
       turns  descriptions  of all access points for that file system. You can
       provide either an AccessPointId or a FileSystemId in the  request,  but
       not both.

       This  operation  requires  permissions  for  the  elasticfilesystem:De-
       scribeAccessPoints action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-access-points
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--access-point-id <value>]
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional) When retrieving all access points for a file system,  you
          can optionally specify the MaxItems parameter to limit the number of
          objects returned in a response. The default value is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the  response  is  paginated.  You  can  use
          NextMarker  in  the subsequent request to fetch the next page of ac-
          cess point descriptions.

       --access-point-id (string)
          (Optional) Specifies an EFS access point  to  describe  in  the  re-
          sponse; mutually exclusive with FileSystemId .

       --file-system-id (string)
          (Optional)  If  you  provide a FileSystemId , EFS returns all access
          points for that file system; mutually exclusive with AccessPointId .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the ac-
                 cess point.

              FileSystemId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the EFS file system that the access point applies
                 to.

              PosixUser -> (structure)
                 The full POSIX identity, including the user ID, group ID, and
                 secondary  group IDs on the access point that is used for all
                 file operations by NFS clients using the access point.

                 Uid -> (long)
                     The POSIX user ID used for all file system operations us-
                     ing this access point.

                     using this access point.

                     Secondary POSIX group IDs used for all file system opera-
                     tions using this access point.

                     (long)

              RootDirectory -> (structure)
                 The  directory  on the Amazon EFS file system that the access
                 point exposes as the root directory to NFS clients using  the
                 access point.

                 Path -> (string)
                     Specifies  the  path  on the EFS file system to expose as
                     the root directory to NFS clients using the access  point
                     to access the EFS file system. A path can have up to four
                     subdirectories. If the specified path does not exist, you
                     are required to provide the CreationInfo .

                 CreationInfo -> (structure)
                     (Optional) Specifies the POSIX IDs and permissions to ap-
                     ply to the access point's RootDirectory . If the  RootDi-
                     rectory  > Path specified does not exist, EFS creates the
                     root directory using the  CreationInfo  settings  when  a
                     client  connects  to an access point. When specifying the
                     CreationInfo , you must provide values  for  all  proper-
                     ties.

                     WARNING:
                        If  you  do not provide CreationInfo and the specified
                        RootDirectory > Path does not exist, attempts to mount
                        the file system using the access point will fail.

                     OwnerUid -> (long)
                        Specifies the POSIX user ID to apply to the RootDirec-
                        tory . Accepts values from 0 to 2^32 (4294967295).

                        Directory , in the format of an  octal  number  repre-
                        senting the file's mode bits.

              OwnerId -> (string)
                 Identified  the Amazon Web Services account that owns the ac-
                 cess point resource.

              LifeCycleState -> (string)
                 Identifies the lifecycle phase of the access point.

       NextToken -> (string)

          sponse.  You  can  use  the  NextMarker in the subsequent request to
          fetch the additional descriptions.
