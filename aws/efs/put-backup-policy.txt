OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          Specifies which EFS file system to update the backup policy for.

          The backup policy included in the PutBackupPolicy request.

          Status -> (string)
              Describes the status of the file system's backup policy.

              o

                **
                ENABLED ** - EFS is automatically backing up the file system.

              o

                **
                ENABLING ** - EFS is turning on automatic backups for the file
                system.

              o

                **
                DISABLED  **  - automatic back ups are turned off for the file
                system.

              o

                **
                DISABLING ** - EFS is turning off automatic  backups  for  the

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "ENABLED"|"ENABLING"|"DISABLED"|"DISABLING"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
