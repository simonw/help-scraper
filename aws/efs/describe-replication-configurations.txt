NAME
       describe-replication-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  replication  configurations  for either a specific file
       system, or all configurations for the Amazon Web Services account in an
       Amazon Web Services Region if a file system is not specified.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replication-configurations
          [--file-system-id <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-system-id (string)
          You can retrieve replication configurations for a specific file sys-
          tem by providing a file system ID.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is present if the  response  is  paginated.  You  can  use
          NextMarker in a subsequent request to fetch the next page of output.

       --max-results (integer)
          (Optional)  You  can  optionally  specify  the MaxItems parameter to
          limit the number of objects returned  in  a  response.  The  default
          value is 100.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Replications -> (list)
          The collection of replication configurations returned.

          (structure)
              SourceFileSystemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the source Amazon EFS file  system  that  is  being
                 replicated.

              SourceFileSystemRegion -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region in which the source Amazon EFS
                 file system is located.

              SourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the current source file system in the  replication
                 configuration.

              OriginalSourceFileSystemArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the original source Amazon
                 EFS file system in the replication configuration.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 Describes when the replication configuration was created.

              Destinations -> (list)
                 Array of destination objects. Only one destination object  is
                 supported.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the destination file system in the replication
                     configuration.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Describes the status of  the  destination  Amazon  EFS
                        file system.

                     FileSystemId -> (string)
                        The ID of the destination Amazon EFS file system.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The  Amazon  Web Services Region in which the destina-
                        tion file system is located.

                     LastReplicatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The time when the most recent sync  successfully  com-
                        pleted  on the destination file system. Any changes to
                        data on the source file system that occurred prior  to
                        this time were successfully replicated to the destina-
                        tion file system. Any changes that occurred after this
                        time might not be fully replicated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          You can use the NextToken from the previous response in a subsequent
          request to fetch the additional descriptions.
