CREATE-ADDON()                                                  CREATE-ADDON()



NAME
       create-addon -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an Amazon EKS add-on.

       Amazon EKS add-ons help to automate the provisioning and lifecycle man-
       agement of common operational software for Amazon EKS clusters.  Amazon
       EKS add-ons require clusters running version 1.18 or later because Ama-
       zon EKS add-ons rely on the Server-side Apply Kubernetes feature, which
       is  only  available in Kubernetes 1.18 and later. For more information,
       see Amazon EKS add-ons in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          [--service-account-role-arn <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to create the add-on for.

       --addon-name (string)
          The name of the add-on. The name must match one  of  the  names  re-
          turned             by             `            DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The  version  of  the add-on. The version must match one of the ver-
          sions       returned        by        `        DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role  to  bind  to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions required by the add-on. If you don't  specify  an  existing
          IAM  role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the node
          IAM role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in  the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To  specify  an  existing  IAM role, you must have an IAM OpenID
              Connect (OIDC) provider created for your cluster. For  more  in-
              formation,  see  Enabling IAM roles for service accounts on your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How to resolve parameter value conflicts when migrating an  existing
          add-on to an Amazon EKS add-on.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique,  case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The metadata to apply to the cluster to assist  with  categorization
          and  organization. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value.
          You define both.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
