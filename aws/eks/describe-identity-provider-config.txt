NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  descriptive  information about an identity provider configura-
       tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-identity-provider-config
          --cluster-name <value>
          --identity-provider-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster name that the identity provider configuration is associ-
          ated to.

       --identity-provider-config (structure)
          An object that represents an identity provider configuration.

          type -> (string)
              The type of the identity provider configuration.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the identity provider configuration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "string",
            "name": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       identityProviderConfig -> (structure)
          The  object  that  represents  an  OpenID  Connect  (OIDC)  identity
          provider configuration.

          oidc -> (structure)
              An  object  that  represents  an  OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity
              provider configuration.

              identityProviderConfigName -> (string)
                 The name of the configuration.

              identityProviderConfigArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the configuration.

              clusterName -> (string)
                 The cluster that the configuration is associated to.

              issuerUrl -> (string)
                 The URL of the OIDC identity provider  that  allows  the  API
                 server to discover public signing keys for verifying tokens.

              clientId -> (string)
                 This  is also known as audience . The ID of the client appli-
                 cation that makes authentication requests to the  OIDC  iden-
                 tity provider.

              usernameClaim -> (string)
                 The JSON Web token (JWT) claim that is used as the username.

              usernamePrefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix  that  is prepended to username claims to prevent
                 clashes with existing names. The prefix can't contain system:

              groupsClaim -> (string)
                 The JSON web token (JWT) claim that the provider uses to  re-
                 turn your groups.

              groupsPrefix -> (string)
                 The  prefix  that  is  prepended  to  group claims to prevent
                 clashes with existing names (such as system: groups). For ex-
                 ample, the value``oidc:`` creates group names like oidc:engi-
                 neering and oidc:infra . The prefix can't contain system:

              requiredClaims -> (map)
                 The key-value pairs that  describe  required  claims  in  the
                 identity  token. If set, each claim is verified to be present
                 in the token with a matching value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tags -> (map)
                 The metadata to apply to the provider configuration to assist
                 with  categorization and organization. Each tag consists of a
                 key and an optional value. You define both.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the OIDC identity provider.
