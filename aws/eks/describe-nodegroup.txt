OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of your cluster.

       --nodegroup-name (string)
          The name of the node group to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       nodegroup -> (structure)
          The full description of your node group.

          nodegroupName -> (string)
              The name associated with an Amazon EKS managed node group.

          nodegroupArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the managed node
              group.

          clusterName -> (string)
              The name of your cluster.

          version -> (string)
              The Kubernetes version of the managed node group.

          releaseVersion -> (string)
              If the node group was deployed using a launch  template  with  a
              custom  AMI,  then  this is the AMI ID that was specified in the
              launch template. For node groups that weren't deployed  using  a
              launch template, this is the version of the Amazon EKS optimized
              AMI that the node group was deployed with.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp at object creation.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp for the last modification  to  the  ob-
              ject.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the managed node group.

          capacityType -> (string)
              The capacity type of your managed node group.

          scalingConfig -> (structure)
              The  scaling  configuration  details  for the Auto Scaling group
              that is associated with your node group.

              minSize -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of nodes that the managed node  group  can
                 scale in to.

              maxSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of nodes that the managed node group can
                 scale out to. For information about the maximum  number  that
                 you  can specify, see Amazon EKS service quotas in the Amazon
                 EKS User Guide .

              desiredSize -> (integer)
                 The current number of  nodes  that  the  managed  node  group
                 should maintain.

                 WARNING:
                     If  you  use  the  Kubernetes  Cluster  Autoscaler  , you
                     shouldn't change the desiredSize value directly, as  this
                     can  cause the Cluster Autoscaler to suddenly scale up or
                     scale down.

                 Whenever this parameter changes, the number of  worker  nodes
                 in  the  node group is updated to the specified size. If this
                 parameter is given a value that is smaller than  the  current
                 number  of  running  worker  nodes,  the  necessary number of
                 worker nodes are terminated to match the  given  value.  When
                 using CloudFormation, no action occurs if you remove this pa-
                 rameter from your CFN template.

                 This parameter can be different from minSize in  some  cases,
                 such  as when starting with extra hosts for testing. This pa-
                 rameter can also be different when you want to start with  an
                 estimated  number  of  needed  hosts, but let the Cluster Au-
                 toscaler reduce the number if there are too  many.  When  the
                 Cluster  Autoscaler is used, the desiredSize parameter is al-
                 tered by the Cluster Autoscaler (but can be  out-of-date  for
                 short  periods of time). the Cluster Autoscaler doesn't scale
                 a managed node group lower than minSize or higher  than  max-
                 Size .

          instanceTypes -> (list)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the instance type  that  is  associated  with  the  node
              group.  If  the  node group was deployed with a launch template,
              then this is null .

              (string)

          subnets -> (list)
              The subnets that were specified for the Auto Scaling group  that
              is associated with your node group.

              (string)

          remoteAccess -> (structure)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the remote access configuration that is associated  with
              the  node  group.  If  the node group was deployed with a launch
              template, then this is null .

              ec2SshKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 SSH key name that provides access for SSH com-
                 munication with the nodes in the managed node group. For more
                 information, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances  in
                 the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud User Guide for Linux In-
                 stances . For Windows, an Amazon EC2 SSH key is used  to  ob-
                 tain  the  RDP password. For more information, see Amazon EC2
                 key pairs and Windows instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute
                 Cloud User Guide for Windows Instances .

              sourceSecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The  security group IDs that are allowed SSH access (port 22)
                 to the nodes. For Windows, the port is 3389. If  you  specify
                 an  Amazon  EC2  SSH  key but don't specify a source security
                 group when you create a managed node group, then the port  on
                 the  nodes  is  opened to the internet (0.0.0.0/0 ). For more
                 information, see Security Groups for Your VPC in  the  Amazon
                 Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

                 (string)

          amiType -> (string)
              If  the  node  group was deployed using a launch template with a
              custom AMI, then this is CUSTOM . For node groups  that  weren't
              deployed  using a launch template, this is the AMI type that was
              specified in the node group configuration.

          nodeRole -> (string)
              The IAM role associated with your node  group.  The  Amazon  EKS
              node  kubelet  daemon makes calls to Amazon Web Services APIs on
              your behalf. Nodes  receive  permissions  for  these  API  calls
              through an IAM instance profile and associated policies.

          labels -> (map)
              The Kubernetes labels applied to the nodes in the node group.

              NOTE:
                 Only  labels  that  are  applied  with the Amazon EKS API are
                 shown here. There may be other Kubernetes labels  applied  to
                 the nodes in this group.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          taints -> (list)
              The  Kubernetes  taints  to  be applied to the nodes in the node
              group when they are created. Effect is one of No_Schedule , Pre-
              fer_No_Schedule  , or No_Execute . Kubernetes taints can be used
              together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled
              to  your nodes. For more information, see Node taints on managed
              node groups .

              (structure)
                 A property that allows a node to repel a Pod . For  more  in-
                 formation, see Node taints on managed node groups in the Ama-
                 zon EKS User Guide .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key of the taint.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the taint.

                 effect -> (string)
                     The effect of the taint.

          resources -> (structure)
              The resources associated with the node group, such as Auto Scal-
              ing groups and security groups for remote access.

              autoScalingGroups -> (list)
                 The Auto Scaling groups associated with the node group.

                 (structure)
                     An  Auto  Scaling group that is associated with an Amazon
                     EKS managed node group.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the Auto Scaling group associated with  an
                        Amazon EKS managed node group.

              remoteAccessSecurityGroup -> (string)
                 The  remote  access  security  group associated with the node
                 group. This security group controls SSH access to the nodes.

          diskSize -> (integer)
              If the node group wasn't deployed with a launch  template,  then
              this  is  the  disk size in the node group configuration. If the
              node group was deployed with a launch  template,  then  this  is
              null .

          health -> (structure)
              The  health  status  of the node group. If there are issues with
              your node group's health, they are listed here.

              issues -> (list)
                 Any issues that are associated with the node group.

                 (structure)
                     An object representing an issue with an  Amazon  EKS  re-
                     source.

                     code -> (string)
                        A brief description of the error.

                        o AccessDenied  :  Amazon  EKS  or one or more of your
                          managed nodes is failing to authenticate  or  autho-
                          rize with your Kubernetes cluster API server.

                        o AsgInstanceLaunchFailures  : Your Auto Scaling group

                          with the same settings to recover.

                        o Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch  :  The  Amazon EC2
                          launch template version for your managed node  group
                          does  not match the version that Amazon EKS created.
                          You may be able to revert to the version that Amazon
                          EKS created to recover.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure   :   We  could  not
                          delete the remote access  security  group  for  your
                          managed node group. Remove any dependencies from the
                          security group.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound  :  We  couldn't  find  the
                          cluster  security  group  for  the cluster. You must
                          recreate your cluster.

                        o Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration : One or  more  Amazon
                          EC2  subnets specified for a node group do not auto-
                          matically assign public IP  addresses  to  instances
                          launched  into  it. If you want your instances to be
                          assigned a public IP address, then you need  to  en-
                          able  the  auto-assign public IP address setting for
                          the subnet. See Modifying  the  public  ``IPv4`  ad-
                          dressing    attribute    for    your    subnet    <-

                        o IamInstanceProfileNotFound : We  couldn't  find  the
                          IAM  instance  profile  for your managed node group.
                          You may be able to recreate an instance profile with
                          the same settings to recover.

                        o IamNodeRoleNotFound  : We couldn't find the IAM role
                          for your managed node group.  You  may  be  able  to
                          recreate  an  IAM role with the same settings to re-
                          cover.

                        o InstanceLimitExceeded : Your Amazon Web Services ac-
                          count  is unable to launch any more instances of the
                          specified instance type. You may be able to  request
                          an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover.

                        o InsufficientFreeAddresses  : One or more of the sub-
                          nets associated with your managed  node  group  does
                          not  have  enough  available  IP  addresses  for new
                          nodes.

                        o InternalFailure : These errors are usually caused by
                          an Amazon EKS server-side issue.

                        o NodeCreationFailure  :  Your  launched instances are
                          unable to register with  your  Amazon  EKS  cluster.
                          Common  causes of this failure are insufficient node
                          IAM role permissions or lack  of  outbound  internet
                          access for the nodes.

                     message -> (string)

                        (string)

          updateConfig -> (structure)
              The node group update configuration.

              maxUnavailable -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of nodes unavailable at once during a ver-
                 sion  update.  Nodes  are  updated in parallel. This value or
                 maxUnavailablePercentage is required to have a value.The max-
                 imum number is 100.

              maxUnavailablePercentage -> (integer)
                 The  maximum percentage of nodes unavailable during a version
                 update. This percentage of nodes are updated in parallel,  up
                 to  100  nodes  at  once. This value or maxUnavailable is re-
                 quired to have a value.

          launchTemplate -> (structure)
              If a launch template was used to create  the  node  group,  then
              this is the launch template that was used.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the launch template.

                 You  must  specify  either  the  launch  template name or the

              version -> (string)
                 The version number of the launch template to use. If no  ver-
                 sion  is  specified,  then  the template's default version is
                 used.

              id -> (string)
                 The ID of the launch template.

                 You must specify either the launch template ID or the  launch

          tags -> (map)
              Metadata that assists with categorization and organization. Each
              tag consists of a key and an optional value.  You  define  both.
              Tags don't propagate to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services
              resources.

              key -> (string)
                 One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key  is  a
