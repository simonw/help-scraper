OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster associated with the node group.

       --nodegroup-name (string)
          The name of the node group to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       nodegroup -> (structure)
          The full description of your node group.

          nodegroupName -> (string)
              The name associated with an Amazon EKS managed node group.

          nodegroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the managed  node
              group.

          clusterName -> (string)
              The name of the cluster that the managed node group resides in.

          version -> (string)
              The Kubernetes version of the managed node group.

          releaseVersion -> (string)
              If  the  node  group was deployed using a launch template with a
              custom AMI, then this is the AMI ID that was  specified  in  the
              launch  template.  For node groups that weren't deployed using a
              launch template, this is the version of the Amazon EKS optimized
              AMI that the node group was deployed with.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  epoch  timestamp in seconds for when the managed node
              group was created.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when  the  managed  node
              group was last modified.

          status -> (string)
              The current status of the managed node group.

          capacityType -> (string)
              The capacity type of your managed node group.

          scalingConfig -> (structure)
              The  scaling  configuration  details  for the Auto Scaling group
              that is associated with your node group.

              minSize -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of nodes that the managed node  group  can
                 scale in to.

              maxSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of nodes that the managed node group can
                 scale out to. For information about the maximum  number  that
                 you  can specify, see Amazon EKS service quotas in the Amazon
                 EKS User Guide .

              desiredSize -> (integer)
                 The current number of  nodes  that  the  managed  node  group
                 should maintain.

                 WARNING:
                     If  you  use Cluster Autoscaler, you shouldn't change the
                     desiredSize value directly, as this can cause the Cluster
                     Autoscaler to suddenly scale up or scale down.

                 Whenever  this  parameter changes, the number of worker nodes
                 in the node group is updated to the specified size.  If  this
                 parameter  is  given a value that is smaller than the current
                 number of running  worker  nodes,  the  necessary  number  of
                 worker  nodes  are  terminated to match the given value. When
                 using CloudFormation, no action occurs if you remove this pa-
                 rameter from your CFN template.

                 This  parameter  can be different from minSize in some cases,
                 such as when starting with extra hosts for testing. This  pa-
                 rameter  can also be different when you want to start with an
                 estimated number of needed hosts, but let Cluster  Autoscaler
                 reduce  the  number  if  there are too many. When Cluster Au-
                 toscaler is used, the desiredSize  parameter  is  altered  by
                 Cluster  Autoscaler (but can be out-of-date for short periods
                 of time). Cluster Autoscaler doesn't  scale  a  managed  node
                 group lower than minSize or higher than maxSize.

          instanceTypes -> (list)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the instance type  that  is  associated  with  the  node
              group.  If  the  node group was deployed with a launch template,
              then this is null .

              (string)

          subnets -> (list)
              The subnets that were specified for the Auto Scaling group  that
              is associated with your node group.

              (string)

          remoteAccess -> (structure)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the remote access configuration that is associated  with
              the  node  group.  If  the node group was deployed with a launch
              template, then this is null .

              ec2SshKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon EC2 SSH key that provides access for SSH  communi-
                 cation with the nodes in the managed node group. For more in-
                 formation, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and  Linux  instances  in
                 the  Amazon  Elastic  Compute  Cloud User Guide for Linux In-
                 stances .

              sourceSecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The security groups that are allowed SSH access (port 22)  to
                 the  nodes.  If  you specify an Amazon EC2 SSH key but do not
                 specify a source security group when  you  create  a  managed
                 node group, then port 22 on the nodes is opened to the inter-
                 net (0.0.0.0/0). For more information,  see  Security  Groups
                 for Your VPC in the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

                 (string)

          amiType -> (string)
              If  the  node  group was deployed using a launch template with a
              custom AMI, then this is CUSTOM . For node groups  that  weren't
              deployed  using a launch template, this is the AMI type that was
              specified in the node group configuration.

          nodeRole -> (string)
              The IAM role associated with your node  group.  The  Amazon  EKS
              node  kubelet  daemon makes calls to Amazon Web Services APIs on
              your behalf. Nodes  receive  permissions  for  these  API  calls
              through an IAM instance profile and associated policies.

          labels -> (map)
              The Kubernetes labels applied to the nodes in the node group.

              NOTE:
                 Only  labels  that  are  applied  with the Amazon EKS API are
                 shown here. There may be other Kubernetes labels  applied  to
                 the nodes in this group.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          taints -> (list)
              The  Kubernetes  taints  to  be applied to the nodes in the node
              group when they are created. Effect is one of No_Schedule , Pre-
              fer_No_Schedule  , or No_Execute . Kubernetes taints can be used
              together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled
              to  your nodes. For more information, see Node taints on managed
              node groups .

              (structure)
                 A property that allows a node to repel a  set  of  pods.  For
                 more information, see Node taints on managed node groups .

                 key -> (string)
                     The key of the taint.

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the taint.

                 effect -> (string)
                     The effect of the taint.

          resources -> (structure)
              The resources associated with the node group, such as Auto Scal-
              ing groups and security groups for remote access.

              autoScalingGroups -> (list)
                 The Auto Scaling groups associated with the node group.

                 (structure)
                     An Auto Scaling group that is associated with  an  Amazon
                     EKS managed node group.

                     name -> (string)
                        The  name of the Auto Scaling group associated with an
                        Amazon EKS managed node group.

              remoteAccessSecurityGroup -> (string)
                 The remote access security group  associated  with  the  node
                 group. This security group controls SSH access to the nodes.

          diskSize -> (integer)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the disk size in the node group  configuration.  If  the
              node  group  was  deployed  with a launch template, then this is
              null .

          health -> (structure)
              The health status of the node group. If there  are  issues  with

                        A brief description of the error.

                        o AccessDenied : Amazon EKS or one  or  more  of  your
                          managed  nodes  is failing to authenticate or autho-
                          rize with your Kubernetes cluster API server.

                        o AsgInstanceLaunchFailures : Your Auto Scaling  group
                          is  experiencing failures while attempting to launch
                          instances.

                        o AutoScalingGroupNotFound : We couldn't find the Auto
                          Scaling  group  associated  with  the  managed  node
                          group. You may be able to recreate an  Auto  Scaling
                          group with the same settings to recover.

                        o ClusterUnreachable  :  Amazon  EKS or one or more of
                          your managed nodes is unable to to communicate  with
                          your  Kubernetes cluster API server. This can happen
                          if there are network disruptions or if  API  servers
                          are timing out processing requests.

                        o Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound  :  We  couldn't  find the
                          Amazon EC2 launch template  for  your  managed  node
                          group. You may be able to recreate a launch template
                          with the same settings to recover.

                        o Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch :  The  Amazon  EC2
                          launch  template version for your managed node group
                          does not match the version that Amazon EKS  created.
                          You may be able to revert to the version that Amazon
                          EKS created to recover.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure  :  We   could   not
                          delete  the  remote  access  security group for your
                          managed node group. Remove any dependencies from the
                          security group.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound  :  We  couldn't  find  the
                          cluster security group for  the  cluster.  You  must
                          recreate your cluster.

                        o Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration  :  One or more Amazon
                          EC2 subnets specified for a node group do not  auto-
                          matically  assign  public  IP addresses to instances
                          launched into it. If you want your instances  to  be
                          assigned  a  public IP address, then you need to en-
                          able the auto-assign public IP address  setting  for
                          the subnet. See Modifying the public IPv4 addressing
                          attribute for your subnet in  the  Amazon  VPC  User
                          Guide .

                        o IamInstanceProfileNotFound  :  We  couldn't find the
                          IAM instance profile for your  managed  node  group.
                          You may be able to recreate an instance profile with
                          the same settings to recover.

                        o IamNodeRoleNotFound : We couldn't find the IAM  role
                          for  your  managed  node  group.  You may be able to
                          recreate an IAM role with the same settings  to  re-
                          cover.

                        o InstanceLimitExceeded : Your Amazon Web Services ac-
                          count is unable to launch any more instances of  the
                          specified  instance type. You may be able to request
                          an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover.

                        o InsufficientFreeAddresses : One or more of the  sub-
                          nets  associated  with  your managed node group does

                          nodes.

                        o InternalFailure : These errors are usually caused by
                          an Amazon EKS server-side issue.

                        o NodeCreationFailure : Your  launched  instances  are
                          unable  to  register  with  your Amazon EKS cluster.
                          Common causes of this failure are insufficient  node
                          IAM  role  permissions  or lack of outbound internet
                          access for the nodes.

          launchTemplate -> (structure)
              If  a  launch  template  was used to create the node group, then

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the launch template.

                 The ID of the launch template.

          tags -> (map)
              The  metadata  applied  to the node group to assist with catego-
              rization and organization. Each tag consists of a key and an op-
              tional  value. You define both. Node group tags do not propagate
              to any other resources associated with the node group,  such  as
              the Amazon EC2 instances or subnets.
