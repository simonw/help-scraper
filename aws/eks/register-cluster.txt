REGISTER-CLUSTER()                                          REGISTER-CLUSTER()



NAME
       register-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Connects a Kubernetes cluster to the Amazon EKS control plane.

       Any Kubernetes cluster can be connected to the Amazon EKS control plane
       to view current information about the cluster and its nodes.

       Cluster connection requires two steps. First, send a ``   RegisterClus-
       terRequest `` to add it to the Amazon EKS control plane.

       Second,  a Manifest containing the activationID and activationCode must
       be applied to the Kubernetes cluster through it's  native  provider  to
       provide visibility.

       After  the  Manifest is updated and applied, then the connected cluster
       is visible to the Amazon EKS control plane. If the Manifest is not  ap-
       plied  within  three days, then the connected cluster will no longer be
       visible and must be deregistered. See  DeregisterCluster .

SYNOPSIS
            register-cluster
          --name <value>
          --connector-config <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Define a unique name for this cluster for your Region.

       --connector-config (structure)
          The configuration settings required to connect the Kubernetes  clus-
          ter to the Amazon EKS control plane.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is authorized to
              request the connector configuration.

          provider -> (string)
              The cloud provider for the target cluster to connect.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,provider=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "provider": "EKS_ANYWHERE"|"ANTHOS"|"GKE"|"AKS"|"OPENSHIFT"|"TANZU"|"RANCHER"|"EC2"|"OTHER"
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --tags (map)
          The  metadata  that  you apply to the cluster to assist with catego-
          rization and organization. Each tag consists of a  key  and  an  op-
          tional  value,  both of which you define. Cluster tags do not propa-
          gate to any other resources associated with the cluster.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  IAM  role  that  provides
              permissions  for  the  Kubernetes control plane to make calls to
              Amazon Web Services API operations on your behalf.

          resourcesVpcConfig -> (structure)
              The VPC configuration used by the cluster control plane.  Amazon
              EKS  VPC  resources  have specific requirements to work properly
              with Kubernetes. For more information, see Cluster VPC Consider-
              ations  and  Cluster Security Group Considerations in the Amazon
              EKS User Guide .

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnets associated with your cluster.

                 (string)

              securityGroupIds -> (list)
                 The security groups associated with the cross-account elastic
                 network  interfaces  that are used to allow communication be-
                 tween your nodes and the Kubernetes control plane.

                 (string)

              clusterSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The cluster security group that was created by Amazon EKS for
                 the  cluster. Managed node groups use this security group for
                 control-plane-to-data-plane communication.

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The VPC associated with your cluster.

              endpointPublicAccess -> (boolean)
                 This parameter indicates whether the Amazon  EKS  public  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled.  If  the Amazon EKS public API
                 server endpoint is disabled, your  cluster's  Kubernetes  API
                 server  can  only receive requests that originate from within
                 the cluster VPC.

              endpointPrivateAccess -> (boolean)
                 This parameter indicates whether the Amazon EKS  private  API
                 server  endpoint  is  enabled.  If the Amazon EKS private API
                 server endpoint is  enabled,  Kubernetes  API  requests  that
                 originate  from within your cluster's VPC use the private VPC
                 endpoint instead of traversing the internet. If this value is
                 disabled  and  you have nodes or Fargate pods in the cluster,
                 then ensure that  publicAccessCidrs  includes  the  necessary
                 CIDR blocks for communication with the nodes or Fargate pods.
                 For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint  access
                 control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

              publicAccessCidrs -> (list)
                 The  CIDR  blocks  that  are allowed access to your cluster's
                 public Kubernetes API server endpoint. Communication  to  the
                 endpoint  from addresses outside of the listed CIDR blocks is
                 denied. The default value is 0.0.0.0/0 . If  you've  disabled
                 private endpoint access and you have nodes or Fargate pods in
                 the cluster, then ensure that the necessary CIDR  blocks  are
                 listed. For more information, see Amazon EKS cluster endpoint
                 access control in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          kubernetesNetworkConfig -> (structure)
              The Kubernetes network configuration for the cluster.

              serviceIpv4Cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block that Kubernetes Pod and Service  IP  addresses
                 are  assigned from. Kubernetes assigns addresses from an IPv4
                 CIDR block assigned to a subnet that the node is in.  If  you
                 didn't  specify  a  CIDR  block when you created the cluster,
                 then   Kubernetes   assigns   addresses   from   either   the
                 10.100.0.0/16 or 172.20.0.0/16 CIDR blocks. If this was spec-
                 ified, then it was specified when the cluster was created and
                 it can't be changed.

              serviceIpv6Cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block that Kubernetes Pod and Service IP addresses
                 are assigned from if you created a 1.21 or later cluster with
                 version  1.10.0  or  later  of  the Amazon VPC CNI add-on and
                 specified ipv6 for ipFamily when you created the cluster. Ku-
                 bernetes  assigns  addresses  from  the  unique local address
                 range (fc00::/7).

              ipFamily -> (string)
                 The IP family used to assign Kubernetes Pod  and  Service  IP
                 addresses.  The  IP family is always ipv4 , unless you have a
                 1.21 or later cluster running version 1.10.0 or later of  the
                 Amazon VPC CNI add-on and specified ipv6 when you created the
                 cluster.

                     types -> (list)
                        The available cluster control plane log types.

                        (string)

                     enabled -> (boolean)
                        If a log type is enabled, that log  type  exports  its
                        control  plane  logs to CloudWatch Logs. If a log type
                        isn't enabled, that log type doesn't export  its  con-
                        trol  plane  logs. Each individual log type can be en-
                        abled or disabled independently.

                 The  Base64-encoded  certificate data required to communicate
                 with your cluster. Add this to the certificate-authority-data
                 section of the kubeconfig file for your cluster.

          clientRequestToken -> (string)
              Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you provide to ensure the
              idempotency of the request.

          platformVersion -> (string)
              The platform version of your Amazon EKS cluster. For more infor-
              mation, see Platform Versions in the * Amazon EKS User Guide * .

          tags -> (map)
              The  metadata that you apply to the cluster to assist with cate-
              gorization and organization. Each tag consists of a key  and  an
              optional  value.  You define both. Cluster tags do not propagate
