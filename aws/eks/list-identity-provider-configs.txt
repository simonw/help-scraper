LIST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER-CONFIGS()              LIST-IDENTITY-PROVIDER-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-identity-provider-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       A list of identity provider configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-identity-provider-configs  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: identityProviderConfigs

SYNOPSIS
            list-identity-provider-configs
          --cluster-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster name that you want to list identity provider  configura-
          tions for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       identityProviderConfigs -> (list)
          The identity provider configurations for the cluster.

          (structure)
              An object representing an identity provider configuration.

              type -> (string)
                 The type of the identity provider configuration.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the identity provider configuration.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken  value returned from a previous paginated ListIdenti-
          tyProviderConfigsResponse where maxResults was used and the  results
          exceeded  the value of that parameter. Pagination continues from the
          end of the previous results that returned the nextToken value.
