CREATE-NODEGROUP()                                          CREATE-NODEGROUP()



NAME
       create-nodegroup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  managed  node group for an Amazon EKS cluster. You can only
       create a node group for your cluster that is equal to the  current  Ku-
       bernetes  version for the cluster. All node groups are created with the
       latest AMI release version for the respective minor Kubernetes  version
       of the cluster, unless you deploy a custom AMI using a launch template.
       For more information about using launch templates, see Launch  template
       support .

       An  Amazon  EKS  managed node group is an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group
       and associated Amazon EC2 instances that are managed by Amazon Web Ser-
       vices  for an Amazon EKS cluster. Each node group uses a version of the
       Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2  AMI.  For  more  information,  see
       Managed Node Groups in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to create the node group in.

       --nodegroup-name (string)
          The unique name to give your node group.

       --scaling-config (structure)
          The scaling configuration details for the Auto Scaling group that is
          created for your node group.

          minSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of nodes that  the  managed  node  group  can
              scale in to.

          maxSize -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number  of  nodes  that the managed node group can
              scale out to. For information about the maximum number that  you
              can  specify,  see  Amazon  EKS service quotas in the Amazon EKS
              User Guide .

          desiredSize -> (integer)
              The current number of nodes that the managed node  group  should
              maintain.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  use Cluster Autoscaler, you shouldn't change the de-
                 siredSize value directly, as this can cause the  Cluster  Au-
                 toscaler to suddenly scale up or scale down.

              Whenever  this  parameter changes, the number of worker nodes in
              the node group is updated to the specified size. If this parame-
              ter  is given a value that is smaller than the current number of
              running worker nodes, the necessary number of worker  nodes  are
              terminated  to match the given value. When using CloudFormation,
              no action occurs if you remove this parameter from your CFN tem-
              plate.

              This parameter can be different from minSize in some cases, such
              as when starting with extra hosts for  testing.  This  parameter
              can  also  be different when you want to start with an estimated
              number of needed hosts, but let Cluster  Autoscaler  reduce  the
              number  if  there are too many. When Cluster Autoscaler is used,
              the desiredSize parameter is altered by Cluster Autoscaler  (but
              can  be  out-of-date  for  short  periods  of time). Cluster Au-
              toscaler doesn't scale a managed node group lower  than  minSize
              or higher than maxSize.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          minSize=integer,maxSize=integer,desiredSize=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "minSize": integer,
            "maxSize": integer,
            "desiredSize": integer
          }

       --disk-size (integer)
          The  root  device  disk size (in GiB) for your node group instances.
          The default disk size is 20 GiB. If  you  specify  launchTemplate  ,
          then  don't  specify  diskSize  ,  or the node group deployment will
          fail. For more information about using launch templates with  Amazon
          EKS, see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --subnets (list)
          The  subnets  to  use for the Auto Scaling group that is created for
          your node group. If you specify launchTemplate , then don't  specify
          `                                                           SubnetId
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CreateNetworkInterface.html`__
          in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail. For
          more information about using launch templates with Amazon  EKS,  see
          Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --instance-types (list)
          Specify  the  instance  types for a node group. If you specify a GPU
          instance type, be sure to specify AL2_x86_64_GPU  with  the  amiType
          parameter. If you specify launchTemplate , then you can specify zero
          or one instance type in your launch template or you can specify 0-20
          instance  types  for  instanceTypes . If however, you specify an in-
          stance type in your launch template and specify any instanceTypes  ,
          the  node  group  deployment  will fail. If you don't specify an in-
          stance type in  a  launch  template  or  for  instanceTypes  ,  then
          t3.medium  is used, by default. If you specify Spot for capacityType
          , then we recommend specifying multiple values for  instanceTypes  .
          For  more  information,  see  Managed  node group capacity types and
          Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ami-type (string)
          The AMI type for your node group. GPU instance types should use  the
          AL2_x86_64_GPU AMI type. Non-GPU instances should use the AL2_x86_64
          AMI type. Arm instances should use  the  AL2_ARM_64  AMI  type.  All
          types  use the Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. If you spec-
          ify launchTemplate , and your launch template  uses  a  custom  AMI,
          then don't specify amiType , or the node group deployment will fail.
          For more information about using launch templates with  Amazon  EKS,
          see Launch template support in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AL2_x86_64

          o AL2_x86_64_GPU

          o AL2_ARM_64

          o CUSTOM

          o BOTTLEROCKET_ARM_64

          o BOTTLEROCKET_ARM_64_NVIDIA

          o BOTTLEROCKET_x86_64_NVIDIA

       --remote-access (structure)
          The  remote  access (SSH) configuration to use with your node group.
          If you specify launchTemplate , then don't specify remoteAccess , or
          the  node group deployment will fail. For more information about us-
          ing launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support in
          the Amazon EKS User Guide .

          ec2SshKey -> (string)
              The  Amazon  EC2 SSH key that provides access for SSH communica-
              tion with the nodes in the managed node group. For more informa-
              tion, see Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances in the Amazon
              Elastic Compute Cloud User Guide for Linux Instances .

          sourceSecurityGroups -> (list)
              The security groups that are allowed SSH access (port 22) to the
              nodes. If you specify an Amazon EC2 SSH key but do not specify a
              source security group when you create a managed node group, then
              port  22 on the nodes is opened to the internet (0.0.0.0/0). For
              more information, see Security Groups for Your VPC in the Amazon
              Virtual Private Cloud User Guide .

            "ec2SshKey": "string",
            "sourceSecurityGroups": ["string", ...]
          }

       --node-role (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM role to associate with
          your node group. The Amazon EKS worker  node  kubelet  daemon  makes
          calls to Amazon Web Services APIs on your behalf. Nodes receive per-
          missions for these API calls through an IAM instance profile and as-
          sociated  policies.  Before  you  can launch nodes and register them
          into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those nodes  to  use
          when  they  are  launched. For more information, see Amazon EKS node
          IAM role in the  *  Amazon  EKS  User  Guide  *  .  If  you  specify
          launchTemplate   ,   then   don't   specify   `   IamInstanceProfile
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_IamInstanceProfile.html`__
          in your launch template, or the node group deployment will fail. For

          The  AMI  version  of  the Amazon EKS optimized AMI to use with your
          node group. By default, the latest available  AMI  version  for  the
          node  group's  current Kubernetes version is used. For more informa-
          tion, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI  versions  in  the
          Amazon  EKS  User  Guide  . If you specify launchTemplate , and your
          launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify releaseVersion
          , or the node group deployment will fail. For more information about
          using launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template  support
          in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --kubernetes-version (string)
          The  Kubernetes  version  to use for your managed nodes. By default,
          the Kubernetes version of the cluster is used, and this is the  only
          accepted  specified  value. If you specify launchTemplate , and your
          launch template uses a custom AMI, then don't specify version  ,  or
          the  node group deployment will fail. For more information about us-
          ing launch templates with Amazon EKS, see Launch template support in
          the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          nodegroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the managed  node
              group.

          releaseVersion -> (string)
              If  the  node  group was deployed using a launch template with a
              custom AMI, then this is the AMI ID that was  specified  in  the
              launch  template.  For node groups that weren't deployed using a
              launch template, this is the version of the Amazon EKS optimized
              AMI that the node group was deployed with.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The  Unix  epoch  timestamp in seconds for when the managed node
              group was created.

          modifiedAt -> (timestamp)
              The Unix epoch timestamp in seconds for when  the  managed  node
              group was last modified.

          scalingConfig -> (structure)
              The  scaling  configuration  details  for the Auto Scaling group
              that is associated with your node group.

              minSize -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of nodes that the managed node  group  can
                 scale in to.

              maxSize -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of nodes that the managed node group can
                 scale out to. For information about the maximum  number  that
                 you  can specify, see Amazon EKS service quotas in the Amazon
                 EKS User Guide .

              desiredSize -> (integer)
                 The current number of  nodes  that  the  managed  node  group
                 should maintain.

                 WARNING:
                     If  you  use Cluster Autoscaler, you shouldn't change the
                     desiredSize value directly, as this can cause the Cluster
                     Autoscaler to suddenly scale up or scale down.

                 Whenever  this  parameter changes, the number of worker nodes
                 in the node group is updated to the specified size.  If  this
                 parameter  is  given a value that is smaller than the current
                 number of running  worker  nodes,  the  necessary  number  of
                 worker  nodes  are  terminated to match the given value. When
                 using CloudFormation, no action occurs if you remove this pa-
                 rameter from your CFN template.

                 This  parameter  can be different from minSize in some cases,
                 such as when starting with extra hosts for testing. This  pa-
                 rameter  can also be different when you want to start with an
                 estimated number of needed hosts, but let Cluster  Autoscaler
                 reduce  the  number  if  there are too many. When Cluster Au-
                 toscaler is used, the desiredSize  parameter  is  altered  by
                 Cluster  Autoscaler (but can be out-of-date for short periods
                 of time). Cluster Autoscaler doesn't  scale  a  managed  node
                 group lower than minSize or higher than maxSize.

          instanceTypes -> (list)
              If  the  node group wasn't deployed with a launch template, then
              this is the instance type  that  is  associated  with  the  node
              group.  If  the  node group was deployed with a launch template,
              then this is null .

              (string)

                 The security groups that are allowed SSH access (port 22)  to
                 the  nodes.  If  you specify an Amazon EC2 SSH key but do not
                 specify a source security group when  you  create  a  managed
                 node group, then port 22 on the nodes is opened to the inter-
                 net (0.0.0.0/0). For more information,  see  Security  Groups

              The  Kubernetes  taints  to  be applied to the nodes in the node
              group when they are created. Effect is one of No_Schedule , Pre-
              fer_No_Schedule  , or No_Execute . Kubernetes taints can be used
              together with tolerations to control how workloads are scheduled
              to  your nodes. For more information, see Node taints on managed
              node groups .

                        A brief description of the error.

                        o AccessDenied : Amazon EKS or one  or  more  of  your
                          managed  nodes  is failing to authenticate or autho-
                          rize with your Kubernetes cluster API server.

                        o AsgInstanceLaunchFailures : Your Auto Scaling  group
                          is  experiencing failures while attempting to launch
                          instances.

                        o AutoScalingGroupNotFound : We couldn't find the Auto
                          Scaling  group  associated  with  the  managed  node
                          group. You may be able to recreate an  Auto  Scaling
                          group with the same settings to recover.

                        o ClusterUnreachable  :  Amazon  EKS or one or more of
                          your managed nodes is unable to to communicate  with
                          your  Kubernetes cluster API server. This can happen
                          if there are network disruptions or if  API  servers
                          are timing out processing requests.

                        o Ec2LaunchTemplateNotFound  :  We  couldn't  find the
                          Amazon EC2 launch template  for  your  managed  node
                          group. You may be able to recreate a launch template
                          with the same settings to recover.

                        o Ec2LaunchTemplateVersionMismatch :  The  Amazon  EC2
                          launch  template version for your managed node group
                          does not match the version that Amazon EKS  created.
                          You may be able to revert to the version that Amazon
                          EKS created to recover.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupDeletionFailure  :  We   could   not
                          delete  the  remote  access  security group for your
                          managed node group. Remove any dependencies from the
                          security group.

                        o Ec2SecurityGroupNotFound  :  We  couldn't  find  the
                          cluster security group for  the  cluster.  You  must
                          recreate your cluster.

                        o Ec2SubnetInvalidConfiguration  :  One or more Amazon
                          EC2 subnets specified for a node group do not  auto-
                          matically  assign  public  IP addresses to instances
                          launched into it. If you want your instances  to  be
                          assigned  a  public IP address, then you need to en-
                          able the auto-assign public IP address  setting  for
                          the subnet. See Modifying the public IPv4 addressing
                          attribute for your subnet in  the  Amazon  VPC  User
                          Guide .

                          IAM instance profile for your  managed  node  group.
                          You may be able to recreate an instance profile with
                          the same settings to recover.

                        o IamNodeRoleNotFound : We couldn't find the IAM  role
                          for  your  managed  node  group.  You may be able to
                          recreate an IAM role with the same settings  to  re-
                          cover.

                        o InstanceLimitExceeded : Your Amazon Web Services ac-
                          count is unable to launch any more instances of  the
                          specified  instance type. You may be able to request
                          an Amazon EC2 instance limit increase to recover.

                        o InsufficientFreeAddresses : One or more of the  sub-
                          nets  associated  with  your managed node group does
                          not have  enough  available  IP  addresses  for  new
                          nodes.

                        o InternalFailure : These errors are usually caused by
                          an Amazon EKS server-side issue.

                        o NodeCreationFailure : Your  launched  instances  are
                          unable  to  register  with  your Amazon EKS cluster.
                          Common causes of this failure are insufficient  node
                          IAM  role  permissions  or lack of outbound internet
                          access for the nodes.
