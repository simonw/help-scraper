SYNOPSIS
            describe-update
          --name <value>
          --update-id <value>
          [--nodegroup-name <value>]
          [--addon-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS cluster associated with the update.

       --update-id (string)
          The ID of the update to describe.

       --nodegroup-name (string)
          The name of the Amazon EKS node group associated  with  the  update.
          This parameter is required if the update is a node group update.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on. The name must match one of the names re-
          turned                by                `                 ListAddons
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_ListAddons.html`__
          . This parameter is required if the update is an add-on update.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
