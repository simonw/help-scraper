UPDATE-NODEGROUP-CONFIG()                            UPDATE-NODEGROUP-CONFIG()



NAME
       update-nodegroup-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an Amazon EKS managed node group configuration. Your node group
       continues to function during the update. The response  output  includes
       an  update  ID  that you can use to track the status of your node group
       update with the  DescribeUpdate API operation. Currently you can update
       the Kubernetes labels for a node group or the scaling configuration.

            ]
          }

       --scaling-config (structure)
          The  scaling  configuration details for the Auto Scaling group after
          the update.

          minSize -> (integer)
              The minimum number of nodes that  the  managed  node  group  can
              scale in to.

          maxSize -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number  of  nodes  that the managed node group can
              scale out to. For information about the maximum number that  you
              can  specify,  see  Amazon  EKS service quotas in the Amazon EKS
              User Guide .

          desiredSize -> (integer)
              The current number of nodes that the managed node  group  should
              maintain.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  use Cluster Autoscaler, you shouldn't change the de-
                 siredSize value directly, as this can cause the  Cluster  Au-
                 toscaler to suddenly scale up or scale down.

              Whenever  this  parameter changes, the number of worker nodes in
              the node group is updated to the specified size. If this parame-
              ter  is given a value that is smaller than the current number of
              running worker nodes, the necessary number of worker  nodes  are
              terminated  to match the given value. When using CloudFormation,
              no action occurs if you remove this parameter from your CFN tem-
              plate.

              This parameter can be different from minSize in some cases, such
              as when starting with extra hosts for  testing.  This  parameter
              can  also  be different when you want to start with an estimated
              number of needed hosts, but let Cluster  Autoscaler  reduce  the
              number  if  there are too many. When Cluster Autoscaler is used,
              the desiredSize parameter is altered by Cluster Autoscaler  (but
              can  be  out-of-date  for  short  periods  of time). Cluster Au-
              toscaler doesn't scale a managed node group lower  than  minSize
              or higher than maxSize.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          minSize=integer,maxSize=integer,desiredSize=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "minSize": integer,
            "maxSize": integer,
            "desiredSize": integer
          }

       --update-config (structure)
          The node group update configuration.

          maxUnavailable -> (integer)
              The maximum number of nodes unavailable at once during a version
              update. Nodes will be updated in parallel. This value  or  maxU-
              navailablePercentage  is  required  to  have a value.The maximum
              number is 100.

          maxUnavailablePercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of nodes unavailable during a version up-
              date.  This  percentage of nodes will be updated in parallel, up
              to 100 nodes at once. This value or maxUnavailable  is  required
              to have a value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maxUnavailable=integer,maxUnavailablePercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "maxUnavailable": integer,
            "maxUnavailablePercentage": integer
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier  that  you provide to ensure the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
