          --cluster-name <value>
          --addon-name <value>
          [--addon-version <value>]
          [--service-account-role-arn <value>]
          [--resolve-conflicts <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster.

       --addon-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  add-on. The name must match one of the names re-
          turned                by                `                 ListAddons
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_ListAddons.html`__
          .

       --addon-version (string)
          The version of the add-on. The version must match one  of  the  ver-
          sions        returned        by        `       DescribeAddonVersions
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddonVersions.html`__
          .

       --service-account-role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of an existing IAM role to bind to
          the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the IAM per-
          missions  required  by  the add-on. If you don't specify an existing
          IAM role, then the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the  node
          IAM  role. For more information, see Amazon EKS node IAM role in the
          Amazon EKS User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To specify an existing IAM role, you must  have  an  IAM  OpenID
              Connect  (OIDC)  provider created for your cluster. For more in-
              formation, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts  on  your
              cluster in the Amazon EKS User Guide .

       --resolve-conflicts (string)
          How  to resolve parameter value conflicts when applying the new ver-
          sion of the add-on to the cluster.

          Possible values:

          o OVERWRITE

          o NONE

       --client-request-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive identifier that you  provide  to  ensure  the
          idempotency of the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
