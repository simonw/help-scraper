START-BULK-DEPLOYMENT()                                START-BULK-DEPLOYMENT()



NAME
       start-bulk-deployment -

DESCRIPTION
       Deploys  multiple  groups in one operation. This action starts the bulk
       deployment of a specified set of group versions. Each group version de-
       ployment will be triggered with an adaptive rate that has a fixed upper
       limit. We recommend that you include an  ''X-Amzn-Client-Token''  token
       in every ''StartBulkDeployment'' request. These requests are idempotent
       with respect to the token and the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-bulk-deployment
          [--amzn-client-token <value>]
          --execution-role-arn <value>
          --input-file-uri <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --amzn-client-token (string) A client token used to correlate  requests
       and responses.

       --execution-role-arn  (string)  The  ARN of the execution role to asso-
       ciate with the bulk deployment operation. This IAM role must allow  the
       ''greengrass:CreateDeployment''  action for all group versions that are
       listed in the input file. This IAM role must  have  access  to  the  S3
       bucket containing the input file.

       --input-file-uri (string) The URI of the input file contained in the S3
       bucket. The execution role must have ''getObject'' permissions on  this
       bucket  to  access the input file. The input file is a JSON-serialized,
       line delimited file with UTF-8 encoding that provides a list  of  group
       and  version  IDs  and the deployment type. This file must be less than
       100 MB. Currently, AWS IoT Greengrass supports  only  ''NewDeployment''
       deployment types.

       --tags (map) Tag(s) to add to the new resource.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start a bulk deployment operation

       The  following  start-bulk-deployment  example starts a bulk deployment
       operation, using a file stored in an S3 bucket to specify the groups to
       be deployed.

          aws greengrass start-bulk-deployment \
              --cli-input-json "{\"InputFileUri\":\"https://gg-group-deployment1.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MyBulkDeploymentInputFile.txt\", \"ExecutionRoleArn\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ggCreateDeploymentRole\",\"AmznClientToken\":\"yourAmazonClientToken\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "BulkDeploymentArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/bulk/deployments/870fb41b-6288-4e0c-bc76-a7ba4b4d3267",
              "BulkDeploymentId": "870fb41b-6288-4e0c-bc76-a7ba4b4d3267"
          }

       For more information, see Create Bulk Deployments for Groups in the AWS
       IoT Greengrass Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       BulkDeploymentArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the bulk deployment.

       BulkDeploymentId -> (string)
          The ID of the bulk deployment.
