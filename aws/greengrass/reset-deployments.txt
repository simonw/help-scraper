RESET-DEPLOYMENTS()                                        RESET-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       reset-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Resets a group's deployments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reset-deployments
          [--amzn-client-token <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          --group-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --amzn-client-token  (string) A client token used to correlate requests
       and responses.

       --force | --no-force (boolean) If true,  performs  a  best-effort  only
       core reset.

       --group-id (string) The ID of the Greengrass group.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To clean up deployment information for a Greengrass group

       The  following  reset-deployments example cleans up deployment informa-
       tion for the specified Greengrass group. When you add the  --force  op-
       tion,  the deployment information is reset without waiting for the core
       device to respond.

          aws greengrass reset-deployments \
              --group-id "1402daf9-71cf-4cfe-8be0-d5e80526d0d8" \
              --force

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/groups/1402daf9-71cf-4cfe-8be0-d5e80526d0d8/deployments/7dd4e356-9882-46a3-9e28-6d21900c011a",
              "DeploymentId": "7dd4e356-9882-46a3-9e28-6d21900c011a"
          }

       For more information, see Reset Deployments in the AWS  IoT  Greengrass
       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeploymentArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the deployment.

       DeploymentId -> (string)
