CREATE-FUNCTION-DEFINITION()                      CREATE-FUNCTION-DEFINITION()



NAME
       create-function-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Lambda  function definition which contains a list of Lambda
       functions and their configurations to be used in a group. You can  cre-
       ate  an initial version of the definition by providing a list of Lambda
       functions and their configurations now, or use  ''CreateFunctionDefini-
       tionVersion'' later.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-function-definition
          [--amzn-client-token <value>]
          [--initial-version <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --amzn-client-token  (string) A client token used to correlate requests
       and responses.

       --initial-version (structure) Information about the initial version  of
       the function definition.DefaultConfig -> (structure)
              The  default  configuration that applies to all Lambda functions
              in this function definition version. Individual Lambda functions
              can override these settings.

              Execution -> (structure)
                 Configuration  information  that specifies how a Lambda func-
                 tion runs.

                 IsolationMode -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the Lambda function runs  in  a  Green-
                     grass  container  (default)  or without containerization.
                     Unless your scenario requires that you run  without  con-
                     tainerization,  we recommend that you run in a Greengrass
                     container. Omit this value to  run  the  Lambda  function
                     with the default containerization for the group.

                 RunAs -> (structure)
                     Specifies  the  user and group whose permissions are used
                     when running the Lambda function. You can specify one  or
                     both  values to override the default values. We recommend
                     that you avoid running as root unless  absolutely  neces-
                     sary  to minimize the risk of unintended changes or mali-
                     cious attacks. To run as root, you must set  ''Isolation-
                     Mode''  to  ''NoContainer''  and  update  config.json  in
                     ''greengrass-root/config''   to   set    ''allowFunction-
                     sToRunAsRoot'' to ''yes''.

                     Gid -> (integer)
                        The  group  ID  whose  permissions  are  used to run a
                        Lambda function.

                     Uid -> (integer)
                        The user ID whose permissions are used to run a Lambda
                        function.

          Functions -> (list)
              A list of Lambda functions in this function definition version.

              (structure)
                 Information about a Lambda function.

                 FunctionArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the Lambda function.

                 FunctionConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The configuration of the Lambda function.

                     EncodingType -> (string)
                        The  expected  encoding  type of the input payload for
                        the function. The default is ''json''.

                     Environment -> (structure)
                        The environment configuration of the function.

                        AccessSysfs -> (boolean)
                            If true, the Lambda function is allowed to  access
                            the  host's  /sys folder. Use this when the Lambda
                            function needs to  read  device  information  from
                            /sys.  This  setting applies only when you run the
                            Lambda function in a Greengrass container.

                        Execution -> (structure)
                            Configuration  related  to  executing  the  Lambda
                            function

                            IsolationMode -> (string)
                               Specifies whether the Lambda function runs in a
                               Greengrass container (default) or without  con-
                               tainerization.  Unless  your  scenario requires
                               that you run without containerization, we  rec-
                               ommend  that you run in a Greengrass container.
                               Omit this value to run the Lambda function with
                               the default containerization for the group.

                            RunAs -> (structure)
                               Specifies  the user and group whose permissions
                               are used when running the Lambda function.  You
                               can  specify one or both values to override the
                               default values. We  recommend  that  you  avoid
                               running  as root unless absolutely necessary to
                               minimize the risk of unintended changes or  ma-
                               licious  attacks.  To run as root, you must set
                               ''IsolationMode'' to ''NoContainer'' and update
                               config.json  in  ''greengrass-root/config''  to
                               set ''allowFunctionsToRunAsRoot'' to ''yes''.

                               Gid -> (integer)
                                   The group ID whose permissions are used  to
                                   run a Lambda function.

                               Uid -> (integer)
                                   The  user  ID whose permissions are used to
                                   run a Lambda function.

                        ResourceAccessPolicies -> (list)
                            A list of the resources, with  their  permissions,
                            to  which  the Lambda function will be granted ac-
                            cess. A Lambda function can have at  most  10  re-
                            sources.  ResourceAccessPolicies  apply  only when
                            you run the Lambda function in a  Greengrass  con-
                            tainer.

                            (structure)
                               A  policy  used by the function to access a re-
                               source.

                               Permission -> (string)
                                   The permissions that  the  Lambda  function
                                   has  to  the resource. Can be one of ''rw''
                                   (read/write) or ''ro'' (read-only).

                               ResourceId -> (string)
                                   The ID of the resource.  (This  ID  is  as-
                                   signed  to the resource when you create the
                                   resource definiton.)

                        Variables -> (map)
                            Environment variables for  the  Lambda  function's
                            configuration.

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

                     ExecArgs -> (string)
                        The execution arguments.

                     Executable -> (string)
                        The name of the function executable.

                     MemorySize -> (integer)
                        The  memory  size, in KB, which the function requires.
                        This setting is not applicable and should  be  cleared
                        when you run the Lambda function without containeriza-
                        tion.

                     Pinned -> (boolean)
                        True if the function is pinned. Pinned means the func-
                        tion is long-lived and starts when the core starts.

                     Timeout -> (integer)
                        The  allowed  function  execution  time,  after  which
                        Lambda should terminate  the  function.  This  timeout
                        still  applies to pinned Lambda functions for each re-
                        quest.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A descriptive or arbitrary  ID  for  the  function.  This
                     value  must be unique within the function definition ver-
                     sion.  Max  length  is  128   characters   with   pattern
                     ''[a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+''.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a Lambda function definition

       The following create-function-definition example creates a Lambda func-
       tion definition and an initial version by providing a  list  of  Lambda
       functions (in this case, a list of just one function named TempMonitor-
       Function) and their configurations. Before you can create the  function
       definition,  you  need  the Lambda function ARN. To create the function
       and its alias, use Lambda's create-function  and  publish-version  com-
       mands.  Lambda's create-function command requires the ARN of the execu-
       tion role, even though AWS IoT Greengrass doesn't use that role because
       permissions  are  specified  in the Greengrass group role.  You can use
       the IAM create-role command to create an empty role to get  an  ARN  to
       use  with Lambda's create-function or you can use an existing execution
       role.

          aws greengrass create-function-definition \
              --name MyGreengrassFunctions \
              --initial-version "{\"Functions\": [{\"Id\": \"TempMonitorFunction\", \"FunctionArn\": \"arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:TempMonitor:GG_TempMonitor\", \"FunctionConfiguration\": {\"Executable\": \"temp_monitor.function_handler\", \"MemorySize\": 16000,\"Timeout\": 5}}]}"

       Output:

          {
              "Arn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/definition/functions/3b0d0080-87e7-48c6-b182-503ec743a08b",
