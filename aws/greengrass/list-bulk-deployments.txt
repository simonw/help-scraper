LIST-BULK-DEPLOYMENTS()                                LIST-BULK-DEPLOYMENTS()



NAME
       list-bulk-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of bulk deployments.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-bulk-deployments  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: BulkDeployments

SYNOPSIS
            list-bulk-deployments
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list bulk deployments

       The following list-bulk-deployments example lists all bulk deployments.

          aws greengrass list-bulk-deployments

       Output:

          {
              "BulkDeployments": [
                  {
                      "BulkDeploymentArn": "arn:aws:greengrass:us-west-2:123456789012:/greengrass/bulk/deployments/870fb41b-6288-4e0c-bc76-a7ba4b4d3267",
                      "BulkDeploymentId": "870fb41b-6288-4e0c-bc76-a7ba4b4d3267",
                      "CreatedAt": "2019-06-25T16:11:33.265Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       BulkDeployments -> (list)
          A list of bulk deployments.

          (structure)
              Information about a bulk deployment. You cannot start a new bulk
              deployment while another one is still running or in a non-termi-
              nal state.

              BulkDeploymentArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the bulk deployment.

              BulkDeploymentId -> (string)
                 The ID of the bulk deployment.

              CreatedAt -> (string)
                 The time, in ISO format, when the deployment was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  for the next set of results, or ''null'' if there are no
          additional results.
