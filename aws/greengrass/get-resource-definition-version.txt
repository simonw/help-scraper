GET-RESOURCE-DEFINITION-VERSION()            GET-RESOURCE-DEFINITION-VERSION()



NAME
       get-resource-definition-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  a resource definition version, including
       which resources are included in the version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-definition-version
          --resource-definition-id <value>
          --resource-definition-version-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-definition-id (string) The ID of the resource definition.

       --resource-definition-version-id (string) The ID of the resource  defi-
       nition version. This value maps to the ''Version'' property of the cor-
       responding  ''VersionInformation''  object,  which   is   returned   by
       ''ListResourceDefinitionVersions'' requests. If the version is the last
       one that was associated with a resource definition, the value also maps
       to  the ''LatestVersion'' property of the corresponding ''DefinitionIn-
       formation'' object.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve information about a specific version of a resource  defini-
       tion

       The  following get-resource-definition-version example retrieves infor-
       mation about the specified version of the  specified  resource  defini-
       tion.  To  retrieve the IDs of all versions of the resource definition,
       use the list-resource-definition-versions command. To retrieve  the  ID
       of  the  last version added to the resource definition, use the get-re-
       source-definition command and check the LatestVersion property.
