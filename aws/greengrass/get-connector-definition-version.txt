GET-CONNECTOR-DEFINITION-VERSION()          GET-CONNECTOR-DEFINITION-VERSION()



NAME
       get-connector-definition-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about a connector definition version, including
       the connectors that the version contains. Connectors are prebuilt  mod-
       ules  that  interact  with local infrastructure, device protocols, AWS,
       and other cloud services.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-connector-definition-version
          --connector-definition-id <value>
          --connector-definition-version-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-definition-id (string) The ID of the connector definition.

       --connector-definition-version-id (string) The ID of the connector def-
       inition  version.  This  value  maps to the ''Version'' property of the
       corresponding  ''VersionInformation''  object,  which  is  returned  by
       ''ListConnectorDefinitionVersions''  requests.  If  the  version is the
       last one that was associated with a  connector  definition,  the  value
       also maps to the ''LatestVersion'' property of the corresponding ''Def-
       initionInformation'' object.

       --next-token (string) The  token  for  the  next  set  of  results,  or
       ''null'' if there are no additional results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retreive information about a specific version of a connector defini-
       tion

       The following get-connector-definition-version example retrieves infor-
       mation about the specified version of the specified  connector  defini-
       tion.  To retrieve the IDs of all versions of the connector definition,
       use the list-connector-definition-versions command. To retrieve the  ID
       of the last version added to the connector definition, use the get-con-
       nector-definition command and check the LatestVersion property.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the connector definition version.

       CreationTimestamp -> (string)
          The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the connector defi-
          nition version was created.

       Definition -> (structure)
          Information about the connector definition version.

          Connectors -> (list)
              A list of references to connectors in this version,  with  their
              corresponding configuration settings.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a connector. Connectors run on the Green-
                 grass core and contain built-in integration with local infra-
                 structure, device protocols, AWS, and other cloud services.

                 ConnectorArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the connector.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A  descriptive  or  arbitrary  ID for the connector. This
                     value must be unique within the connector definition ver-
                     sion.   Max   length   is  128  characters  with  pattern
                     [a-zA-Z0-9:_-]+.

                 Parameters -> (map)
                     The parameters or configuration that the connector uses.

                     value -> (string)

       Id -> (string)
          The ID of the connector definition version.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or ''null'' if there  are  no
          additional results.

       Version -> (string)
