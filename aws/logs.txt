DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your
       log files from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other  sources.  You  can
       then  retrieve  the  associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the
       CloudWatch console. Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands
       in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs
       SDK.

       You can use CloudWatch Logs to:

       o Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time : You can use CloudWatch
         Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example,
         CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your ap-
         plication  logs.  Then,  it  can send you a notification whenever the
         rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch  Logs
         uses  your  log  data for monitoring so no code changes are required.
         For example, you can monitor application logs  for  specific  literal
         terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the num-
         ber of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in  log
         data  (such  as "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the
         term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data
         to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.

       o Monitor  CloudTrail  logged  events : You can create alarms in Cloud-
         Watch and receive notifications of particular API  activity  as  cap-
         tured  by  CloudTrail.  You can use the notification to perform trou-
         bleshooting.

       o Archive log data : You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data
         in  highly  durable storage. You can change the log retention setting
         so that any log events earlier than this  setting  are  automatically
         deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent helps to quickly send both rotated
         and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service.  You
         can then access the raw log data when you need it.
