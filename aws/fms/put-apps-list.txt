SYNOPSIS
            put-apps-list
          --apps-list <value>
          [--tag-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --apps-list (structure)
          The details of the Firewall Manager applications list to be created.

          ListId -> (string)
              The ID of the Firewall Manager applications list.

          ListName -> (string)
              The name of the Firewall Manager applications list.

          ListUpdateToken -> (string)
              A unique identifier for each update to the list. When you update
              the list, the update token must match the token of  the  current
              version of the application list. You can retrieve the update to-
              ken by getting the list.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time that the Firewall Manager applications  list  was  cre-
              ated.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  that  the Firewall Manager applications list was last
              updated.

          AppsList -> (list)
              An array of applications in the  Firewall  Manager  applications
              list.

              (structure)

                     Port -> (long)
                        The application's port number, for example 80 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ListId=string,ListName=string,ListUpdateToken=string,CreateTime=timestamp,LastUpdateTime=timestamp,AppsList=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],PreviousAppsList={KeyName1=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}],KeyName2=[{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long},{AppName=string,Protocol=string,Port=long}]}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ListId": "string",
            "ListName": "string",
            "ListUpdateToken": "string",
            "CreateTime": timestamp,
            "LastUpdateTime": timestamp,
            "AppsList": [
              {
                "AppName": "string",
                "Protocol": "string",
                "Port": long
              }
              ...
            ],
            "PreviousAppsList": {"string": [
                  {
                    "AppName": "string",
                    "Protocol": "string",
                    "Port": long
                  }
                  ...
                ]
              ...}
          }

       --tag-list (list)
          The tags associated with the resource.

          (structure)
              A collection of key:value pairs associated with  an  Amazon  Web
              Services  resource.  The  key:value pair can be anything you de-
              fine. Typically, the tag key represents a category (such as "en-
              vironment") and the tag value represents a specific value within
              that category (such as "test," "development," or  "production").
              You can add up to 50 tags to each Amazon Web Services resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag key to describe a category of information, such as  "cus-
                 tomer." Tag keys are case-sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 Part  of the key:value pair that defines a tag. You can use a
                 tag value to describe a specific  value  within  a  category,
                 such  as "companyA" or "companyB." Tag values are case-sensi-
                 tive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
