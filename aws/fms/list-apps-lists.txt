NAME
       list-apps-lists -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of AppsListDataSummary objects.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-apps-lists is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: AppsLists

SYNOPSIS
            list-apps-lists
          [--default-lists | --no-default-lists]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --default-lists | --no-default-lists (boolean)
          Specifies whether the lists to retrieve are default lists  owned  by
          Firewall Manager.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AppsLists -> (list)
          An array of AppsListDataSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details of the Firewall Manager applications list.

              ListArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the applications list.

              ListId -> (string)
                 The ID of the applications list.

              ListName -> (string)
                 The name of the applications list.

              AppsList -> (list)
                 An  array of App objects in the Firewall Manager applications
                 list.

                 (structure)
                     An individual Firewall Manager application.

                     AppName -> (string)
                        The application's name.

                     Protocol -> (string)
                        The IP protocol name or number. The name can be one of
                        tcp , udp , or icmp . For information on possible num-
                        bers, see Protocol Numbers .

                     Port -> (long)
                        The application's port number, for example 80 .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you specify a value for MaxResults in your list request, and  you
          have  more  objects  than the maximum, Firewall Manager returns this
          token in the response. You can use this token in subsequent requests
          to retrieve the next batch of objects.
