LIST-MEMBER-ACCOUNTS()                                  LIST-MEMBER-ACCOUNTS()



NAME
       list-member-accounts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  MemberAccounts object that lists the member accounts in the
       administrator's Amazon Web Services organization.

       The ListMemberAccounts must be submitted by the account that is set  as
       the Firewall Manager administrator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-member-accounts  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: MemberAccounts

SYNOPSIS
            list-member-accounts
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the member accounts in the organization

       The  following list-member-accounts example lists all of the member ac-
       counts that are in the Firewall Manager administrator's organization.

          aws fms list-member-accounts

       Output:

          {
              "MemberAccounts": [
                  "222222222222",
                  "333333333333",
                  "444444444444"
              ]
          }

       For more information, see AWS Firewall Manager  in  the  AWS  WAF,  AWS
       Firewall Manager, and AWS Shield Advanced Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       MemberAccounts -> (list)
          An array of account IDs.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  you have more member account IDs than the number that you speci-
          fied for MaxResults in the request, the response includes a  NextTo-
          ken  value.  To list more IDs, submit another ListMemberAccounts re-
          quest, and specify the NextToken value  from  the  response  in  the
          NextToken value in the next request.
