NAME
       get-violation-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  violations  for  a  resource based on the specified Firewall
       Manager policy and Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-violation-details
          --policy-id <value>
          --member-account <value>
          --resource-id <value>
          --resource-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.
          This currently only supports security group content audit policies.

       --member-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID that you want the details for.

       --resource-id (string)
          The ID of the resource that has violations.

       --resource-type (string)
          The  resource  type.  This  is in the format shown in the Amazon Web
          Services Resource Types Reference . Supported  resource  types  are:
          AWS::EC2::Instance  , AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface , AWS::EC2::Securi-
          tyGroup , AWS::NetworkFirewall::FirewallPolicy , and  AWS::EC2::Sub-
          net .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
