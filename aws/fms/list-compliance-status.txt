LIST-COMPLIANCE-STATUS()                              LIST-COMPLIANCE-STATUS()



NAME
       list-compliance-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  an  array of PolicyComplianceStatus objects. Use PolicyCompli-
       anceStatus to get a summary of which member accounts are  protected  by
       the specified policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-compliance-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: PolicyComplianceStatusList

SYNOPSIS
            list-compliance-status
          --policy-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager policy that you want the details for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       compliance information for the specified policy.

OUTPUT
       PolicyComplianceStatusList -> (list)
          An array of PolicyComplianceStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Indicates whether the account is compliant  with  the  specified
              policy. An account is considered noncompliant if it includes re-
              sources that are not protected by the policy, for WAF and Shield
              Advanced policies, or that are noncompliant with the policy, for
              security group policies.

              PolicyOwner -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account  that  created  the  Firewall
                 Manager policy.

              PolicyId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Firewall Manager policy.

              PolicyName -> (string)
                 The name of the Firewall Manager policy.

              MemberAccount -> (string)
                 The member account ID.

              EvaluationResults -> (list)
                 An array of EvaluationResult objects.

                 (structure)
                     Describes  the  compliance status for the account. An ac-
                     count is considered noncompliant if it includes resources
                     that  are  not  protected by the specified policy or that
                     don't comply with the policy.

                     ComplianceStatus -> (string)
                        Describes an Amazon Web Services account's  compliance
                        with the Firewall Manager policy.

                     ViolatorCount -> (long)
                        The number of resources that are noncompliant with the
                        specified policy. For WAF and  Shield  Advanced  poli-
                        cies,  a  resource is considered noncompliant if it is
                        not associated with the  policy.  For  security  group
                        policies,  a resource is considered noncompliant if it
                        doesn't comply with the rules of the policy and  reme-
                        diation is disabled or not possible.

                     EvaluationLimitExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates  that  over  100  resources are noncompliant
                        with the Firewall Manager policy.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 Timestamp of the last update to the EvaluationResult objects.

              IssueInfoMap -> (map)
                 Details about problems with dependent services, such  as  WAF
                 or  Config, and the error message received that indicates the
                 problem with the service.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you have more PolicyComplianceStatus objects than the number that
          you specified for MaxResults in the request, the response includes a
          NextToken value. To list more PolicyComplianceStatus objects, submit
          another  ListComplianceStatus  request,  and  specify  the NextToken
          value from the response in the NextToken value in the next request.
