GET-PROTECTION-STATUS()                                GET-PROTECTION-STATUS()



NAME
       get-protection-status -

DESCRIPTION
       If  you  created  a Shield Advanced policy, returns policy-level attack
       summary information in the event of a potential DDoS attack. Other pol-
       icy types are currently unsupported.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-protection-status
          --policy-id <value>
          [--member-account-id <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID  of the policy for which you want to get the attack informa-
          tion.

       --member-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that is in scope of the policy  that
          you want to get the details for.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start  of  the  time period to query for the attacks. This is a
          timestamp type. The request syntax listing indicates a  number  type
          because  the  default  used by Firewall Manager is Unix time in sec-
          onds. However, any valid timestamp format is allowed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time period to query for the attacks. This is a time-
          stamp  type.  The request syntax listing indicates a number type be-
          cause the default used by Firewall Manager is Unix time in  seconds.
          However, any valid timestamp format is allowed.

       --next-token (string)
          If you specify a value for MaxResults and you have more objects than
          the number that you specify for MaxResults ,  Firewall  Manager  re-
          turns  a  NextToken  value in the response, which you can use to re-
          trieve another group of objects. For the second and subsequent  Get-
          ProtectionStatus  requests,  specify the value of NextToken from the
          previous response to get information about another batch of objects.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies the number of objects that you want  Firewall  Manager  to
          return  for  this  request. If you have more objects than the number
          that you specify for MaxResults , the response includes a  NextToken
          value that you can use to get another batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AdminAccountId -> (string)
          The ID of the Firewall Manager administrator account for  this  pol-
          icy.

       ServiceType -> (string)
          The service type that is protected by the policy. Currently, this is
          always SHIELD_ADVANCED .

       Data -> (string)
          Details about the attack, including the following:

          o Attack type

          o Account ID

          o ARN of the resource attacked

          o Start time of the attack

          o End time of the attack (ongoing attacks will not have an end time)

          The details are in JSON format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If you have more objects than the  number  that  you  specified  for
          MaxResults  in the request, the response includes a NextToken value.
          To list more objects, submit  another  GetProtectionStatus  request,
          and  specify  the NextToken value from the response in the NextToken
          value in the next request.

          Amazon Web Services SDKs provide auto-pagination that identify Next-
          Token  in a response and make subsequent request calls automatically
          on your behalf. However, this feature is not supported by GetProtec-
          tionStatus  . You must submit subsequent requests with NextToken us-
          ing your own processes.
