NAME
       get-compliance-detail -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed compliance information about the specified member ac-
       count. Details include resources that are in and out of compliance with
       the specified policy.

       o Resources  are  considered  noncompliant  for WAF and Shield Advanced
         policies if the specified policy has not been applied to them.

       o Resources are considered noncompliant for security group policies  if
         they are in scope of the policy, they violate one or more of the pol-
         icy rules, and remediation is disabled or not possible.

       o Resources are considered noncompliant for Network  Firewall  policies
         if  a  firewall is missing in the VPC, if the firewall endpoint isn't
         set up in an expected Availability Zone and subnet, if a subnet  cre-
         ated  by  the Firewall Manager doesn't have the expected route table,
         and for modifications to a firewall policy that violate the  Firewall
         Manager policy's rules.

       o Resources  are considered noncompliant for DNS Firewall policies if a
         DNS Firewall rule group is missing from the rule  group  associations
         for the VPC.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-detail
          --policy-id <value>
          --member-account <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --policy-id (string)
          The  ID of the policy that you want to get the details for. PolicyId
          is returned by PutPolicy and by ListPolicies .

       --member-account (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account that owns  the  resources  that  you
          want to get the details for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --member-account 123456789012

       Output:
