GET-LABEL-DETECTION()                                    GET-LABEL-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-label-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the label detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartLabelDetection .

       The label detection operation is started by a call to  StartLabelDetec-
       tion  which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the label detection
       operation finishes, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to
       the  Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial
       call to StartlabelDetection . To get the results of the label detection
       operation,  first  check  that the status value published to the Amazon
       SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetLabelDetection  and  pass  the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartLabelDetection .
          GetLabelDetection  returns  an  array  of  detected labels (Labels )
          sorted by the time the labels were detected. You can  also  sort  by
          the label name by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.

       The  labels  returned include the label name, the percentage confidence
       in the accuracy of the detected label, and the time the label  was  de-
       tected in the video.

       The  returned  labels  also include bounding box information for common
       objects, a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels, and the version of
       the label model used for detection.

       Use  MaxResults  parameter  to  limit the number of labels returned. If
       there are more results than specified in  MaxResults  ,  the  value  of
       NextToken  in  the  operation  response contains a pagination token for
       getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results,  call
       GetlabelDetection and populate the NextToken request parameter with the
       token value returned from the previous call to GetLabelDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-label-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job identifier for the label detection operation for which you  want
          results  returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call to
          StartlabelDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum number of results to return per paginated call. The  largest
          value  you  can specify is 1000. If you specify a value greater than
          1000, a maximum of 1000 results is returned. The  default  value  is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the previous response was incomplete (because there are more la-
          bels to retrieve), Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination to-
          ken  in  the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of labels.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort to use for elements in the Labels array. Use TIMESTAMP to  sort
          array  elements  by the time labels are detected. Use NAME to alpha-
          betically group elements for a label  together.  Within  each  label
          group, the array element are sorted by detection confidence. The de-
          fault sort is by TIMESTAMP .

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o TIMESTAMP

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the results of an objects and scenes detection operation

       The  following  get-label-detection  command displays the results of an
       objects and scenes detection operation that you started  previously  by
       calling start-label-detection.
