DETECT-LABELS()                                                DETECT-LABELS()



NAME
       detect-labels -

DESCRIPTION
       Detects  instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG)
       provided as input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and  table;
       events  like wedding, graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like
       landscape, evening, and nature.

       For an example, see Analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3  bucket  in
       the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

       You  pass  the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a refer-
       ence to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call
       Amazon  Rekognition  operations,  passing image bytes is not supported.
       The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.
          Optional Parameters

       You can specify one or both of the GENERAL_LABELS and  IMAGE_PROPERTIES
       feature  types when calling the DetectLabels API. Including GENERAL_LA-
       BELS will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the input
       image,  while  including  IMAGE_PROPERTIES will ensure the response in-
       cludes information about the image quality and color.

       When using GENERAL_LABELS and/or IMAGE_PROPERTIES you can provide  fil-
       tering  criteria to the Settings parameter. You can filter with sets of
       individual labels or with label categories. You can  specify  inclusive
       filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive
       filters. For more information on filtering see Detecting Labels  in  an
       Image .

       When  getting labels, you can specify MinConfidence to control the con-
       fidence threshold for the labels returned. The default is 55%. You  can
       also  add  the  MaxLabels  parameter  to limit the number of labels re-
       turned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels. These arguments are
       only valid when supplying GENERAL_LABELS as a feature type.
          Response Elements

       For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels.
       The API returns the following types of information about labels:

       o Name - The name of the detected label.

       o Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to  a  de-
         tected object.

       o Parents  - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels re-
         turns a hierarchical taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a  de-
         tected  car  might  be  assigned the label car. The label car has two
         parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its grandpar-
         ent).  The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where ev-
         ery ancestor is a unique label. In the previous example,  Car,  Vehi-
         cle,  and  Transportation  are  returned  as unique labels in the re-
         sponse.

       o Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.

       o Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to.

       o BoundingBox  Bounding boxes are described for all  instances  of  de-
         tected  common  object  labels,  returned in an array of Instance ob-
         jects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox  object,  describing
         the  location  of  the label on the input image. It also includes the
         confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box.

       The API returns the following information regarding the image, as  part
       of the ImageProperties structure:

       o Quality  -  Information about the Sharpness, Brightness, and Contrast
         of the input image, scored between 0 to 100.  Image  quality  is  re-
         turned  for the entire image, as well as the background and the fore-
         ground.

       o Dominant Color - An array of the dominant colors in the image.

       o Foreground - Information about the sharpness, brightness,  and  domi-
         nant colors of the input images foreground.

       o Background  -  Information about the sharpness, brightness, and domi-
         nant colors of the input images background.

       The list of returned labels will include at least one label  for  every
       detected  object,  along with information about that label. In the fol-
       lowing example, suppose the input image has a lighthouse, the sea,  and
       a rock. The response includes all three labels, one for each object, as
       well as the confidence in the label:
          {Name: lighthouse, Confidence: 98.4629}

          {Name: rock,Confidence: 79.2097}

          {Name: sea,Confidence: 75.061}

       The list of labels can include multiple labels for the same object. For
       example,  if the input image shows a flower (for example, a tulip), the
       operation might return the following three labels.
          {Name: flower,Confidence: 99.0562}

          {Name: plant,Confidence: 99.0562}

          {Name: tulip,Confidence: 99.0562}

       In this example, the detection algorithm more precisely identifies  the
       flower as a tulip.

       NOTE:
          If  the  object  detected is a person, the operation doesn't provide
          the same facial details that the  DetectFaces operation provides.

       This is a stateless API operation that doesn't return any data.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the  rekognition:Detect-
       Labels action.

OPTIONS
       --image (structure)
          The  input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you use
          the AWS CLI to call Amazon  Rekognition  operations,  passing  image
          bytes is not supported. Images stored in an S3 Bucket do not need to
          be base64-encoded.

          If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon  Rekognition,  you  might
          not  need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field.
          For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer
          guide.

          To specify a local file use --image-bytes instead.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              Blob  of  image  bytes  up to 5 MBs. Note that the maximum image
              size you can pass to DetectCustomLabels is 4MB.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --max-labels (integer)
          Maximum  number  of labels you want the service to return in the re-
          sponse. The service returns the specified number of  highest  confi-
          dence  labels. Only valid when GENERAL_LABELS is specified as a fea-
          ture type in the Feature input parameter.

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies the minimum confidence level for  the  labels  to  return.
          Amazon  Rekognition  doesn't return any labels with confidence lower
          than this specified value.

          If MinConfidence is not specified, the operation returns labels with
          a  confidence values greater than or equal to 55 percent. Only valid
          when GENERAL_LABELS is specified as a feature type  in  the  Feature
          input parameter.

       --features (list)
          A  list  of the types of analysis to perform. Specifying GENERAL_LA-
          BELS uses the label detection feature, while specifying  IMAGE_PROP-
          ERTIES  returns information regarding image color and quality. If no
          option is specified GENERAL_LABELS is used by default.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

            }
          }

       --image-bytes (blob)
          The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a
          local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect a label in an image

       The following detect-labels example detects scenes and  objects  in  an
       image stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws rekognition detect-labels \
              --image '{"S3Object":{"Bucket":"bucket","Name":"image"}}'

       OrientationCorrection -> (string)
          The value of OrientationCorrection is always null.

          If the input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable
          image file format (Exif) metadata that includes the image's orienta-
          tion. Amazon Rekognition uses this orientation information  to  per-
          form  image  correction. The bounding box coordinates are translated
          to represent object locations after the orientation  information  in
          the  Exif  metadata is used to correct the image orientation. Images
          in .png format don't contain Exif metadata.
