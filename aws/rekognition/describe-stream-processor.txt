DESCRIBE-STREAM-PROCESSOR()                        DESCRIBE-STREAM-PROCESSOR()



NAME
       describe-stream-processor -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about a stream processor created by  CreateStream-
       Processor . You can get information about the input and output streams,
       the  input parameters for the face recognition being performed, and the
       current status of the stream processor.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stream-processor
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the stream processor for which you want information.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a stream processor

       The  following describe-stream-processor command displays details about
       the specified stream processor.

          aws rekognition describe-stream-processor \
              --name my-stream-processor

       Output:

OUTPUT
       Name -> (string)
          Name of the stream processor.

       StreamProcessorArn -> (string)
          ARN of the stream processor.

       Status -> (string)
          Current status of the stream processor.

       StatusMessage -> (string)
          Detailed status message about the stream processor.

       CreationTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          Date and time the stream processor was created

       LastUpdateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time, in Unix format, the stream processor was last updated. For
          example, when the stream processor moves from a running state  to  a
          failed state, or when the user starts or stops the stream processor.

       Input -> (structure)
          Kinesis video stream that provides the source streaming video.

          KinesisVideoStream -> (structure)
              The  Kinesis  video stream input stream for the source streaming
              video.

              Arn -> (string)
                 ARN of the Kinesis  video  stream  stream  that  streams  the
                 source video.

       Output -> (structure)
          Kinesis  data  stream  to  which  Amazon  Rekognition Video puts the
          analysis results.

          KinesisDataStream -> (structure)
              The Amazon Kinesis Data  Streams  stream  to  which  the  Amazon
              Rekognition stream processor streams the analysis results.

              Arn -> (string)
                 ARN of the output Amazon Kinesis Data Streams stream.

       RoleArn -> (string)
          ARN of the IAM role that allows access to the stream processor.

       Settings -> (structure)
          Face  recognition input parameters that are being used by the stream
          processor. Includes the collection to use for face  recognition  and
          the face attributes to detect.

          FaceSearch -> (structure)
              Face search settings to use on a streaming video.

              CollectionId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of a collection that contains faces that you want to
                 search for.

              FaceMatchThreshold -> (float)
                 Minimum face match confidence score that must be met  to  re-
                 turn  a result for a recognized face. The default is 80. 0 is
                 the lowest confidence. 100 is the highest confidence.  Values
                 between  0 and 100 are accepted, and values lower than 80 are
                 set to 80.
