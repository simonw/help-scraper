START-FACE-DETECTION()                                  START-FACE-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-face-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of faces in a stored video.

       Amazon  Rekognition Video can detect faces in a video stored in an Ama-
       zon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  filename
       of the video. StartFaceDetection returns a job identifier (JobId ) that
       you use to get the results of the operation.  When  face  detection  is
       finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in  Notifica-
       tionChannel . To get the results of the face detection operation, first
       check that the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic  is  SUC-
       CEEDED . If so, call  GetFaceDetection and pass the job identifier (Jo-
       bId ) from the initial call to StartFaceDetection .

       For more information, see Detecting faces in a stored video in the Ama-
       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            start-face-detection
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--face-attributes <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want  to detect faces. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartFaceDetection requests, the same JobId
          is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from be-
          ing accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The ARN of the Amazon SNS topic to which you want Amazon Rekognition
          Video  to publish the completion status of the face detection opera-
          tion. The Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name that  begins  with
          AmazonRekognition  if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole
          permissions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the  com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --face-attributes (string)
          The face attributes you want returned.
              DEFAULT - The following subset  of  facial  attributes  are  re-
              turned: BoundingBox, Confidence, Pose, Quality and Landmarks.

              ALL - All facial attributes are returned.

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o ALL

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To detect faces in a video

       The following start-face-detection command starts a job to detect faces
       in the specified video file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          aws rekognition start-face-detection
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting Faces in a Stored Video in the Ama-
       zon Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The identifier for the face detection job. Use JobId to identify the
          job in a subsequent call to GetFaceDetection .
