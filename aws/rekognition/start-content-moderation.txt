START-CONTENT-MODERATION()                          START-CONTENT-MODERATION()



NAME
       start-content-moderation -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  asynchronous detection of inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive
       content in a stored video. For a list of moderation  labels  in  Amazon
       Rekognition, see Using the image and video moderation APIs .

       Amazon  Rekognition  Video can moderate content in a video stored in an
       Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  file-
       name of the video. StartContentModeration returns a job identifier (Jo-
       bId ) which you use to get the results of the  analysis.  When  content
       analysis  is  finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion
       status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify
       in NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the content analysis, first check that the status
       value published to the Amazon SNS topic is  SUCCEEDED  .  If  so,  call
       GetContentModeration and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the ini-
       tial call to StartContentModeration .

       For more information, see Moderating content in the Amazon  Rekognition
       Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            start-content-moderation
          --video <value>
          [--min-confidence <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which you want to detect inappropriate, unwanted, or
          offensive content. The video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies  the  minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition must have
          in order to return a moderated content label. Confidence  represents
          how certain Amazon Rekognition is that the moderated content is cor-
          rectly identified. 0 is the lowest confidence. 100  is  the  highest
          confidence.  Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any moderated content
          labels with a confidence level lower than this specified  value.  If
          you  don't  specify MinConfidence , GetContentModeration returns la-
          bels with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same  token  with multiple StartContentModeration requests, the same
          JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent  the  same  job
          from being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon Rekognition Video to
          publish the completion status of the content analysis to. The Amazon
          SNS  topic must have a topic name that begins with AmazonRekognition
          if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy
          to access the topic.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start the recognition of unsafe content in a stored video

       The following start-content-moderation command starts a job  to  detect
       unsafe  content  in  the  specified  video  file stored in an Amazon S3
       bucket.

          aws rekognition start-content-moderation \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting Unsafe Stored Videos in the  Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier  for the content analysis job. Use JobId to identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetContentModeration .
