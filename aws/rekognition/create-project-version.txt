CREATE-PROJECT-VERSION()                              CREATE-PROJECT-VERSION()



NAME
       create-project-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new version of a model and begins training. Models are man-
       aged as part of an Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels  project.  The  re-
       sponse  from  CreateProjectVersion is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for
       the version of the model.

       Training uses the  training  and  test  datasets  associated  with  the
       project.  For  more information, see Creating training and test dataset
       in the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels Developer Guide .

       NOTE:
          You can train a modelin  a  project  that  doesn't  have  associated
          datasets  by specifying manifest files in the TrainingData and Test-
          ingData fields.

          If you open the console after training a model with manifest  files,
          Amazon  Rekognition Custom Labels creates the datasets for you using
          the most recent manifest files. You can no longer train a model ver-
          sion for the project by specifying manifest files.

          Instead  of  training with a project without associated datasets, we
          recommend that you use the manifest files  to  create  training  and
          test datasets for the project.

       Training  takes  a while to complete. You can get the current status by
       calling  DescribeProjectVersions . Training completed  successfully  if
       the value of the Status field is TRAINING_COMPLETED .

       If  training fails, see Debugging a failed model training in the Amazon
       Rekognition Custom Labels developer guide.

       Once training has successfully completed, call  DescribeProjectVersions
       to  get  the training results and evaluate the model. For more informa-
       tion, see Improving a trained Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels model in
       the Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels developers guide.

       After  evaluating  the model, you start the model by calling  StartPro-
       jectVersion .

       This operation requires permissions  to  perform  the  rekognition:Cre-
       ateProjectVersion action.

          }

       --training-data (structure)
          Specifies an external manifest that the services uses to  train  the

              images (assets).

              (structure)
                 Assets  are  the  images that you use to train and evaluate a
                 model version. Assets can also contain validation information
                 that you use to debug a failed model training.

                 GroundTruthManifest -> (structure)
                     The  S3  bucket  that contains an Amazon Sagemaker Ground

                     S3Object -> (structure)
                        Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

                        The region for the S3 bucket containing the S3  object
                        must  match  the region you use for Amazon Rekognition
                        operations.

                        For Amazon Rekognition to process an  S3  object,  the
                        user must have permission to access the S3 object. For
                        more information, see Resource-Based Policies  in  the
                        Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

                        Bucket -> (string)
                            Name of the S3 bucket.

                            S3 object key name.

                        Version -> (string)
                            If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can spec-
                            ify the object version.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Assets": [
              {
                "GroundTruthManifest": {
                  "S3Object": {
                    "Bucket": "string",
                    "Name": "string",
                    "Version": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --testing-data (structure)
          Specifies an external manifest that the service  uses  to  test  the
          model. If you specify TestingData you must also specify TrainingData
          . The project must not have any associated datasets.

          Assets -> (list)

              (structure)
                 Assets are the images that you use to train  and  evaluate  a
                 model version. Assets can also contain validation information
                 that you use to debug a failed model training.

                 GroundTruthManifest -> (structure)
                     The S3 bucket that contains an  Amazon  Sagemaker  Ground
                     Truth format manifest file.

                     S3Object -> (structure)
                        Provides the S3 bucket name and object name.

                        The  region for the S3 bucket containing the S3 object
                        must match the region you use for  Amazon  Rekognition
                        operations.

                        For  Amazon  Rekognition  to process an S3 object, the
                        user must have permission to access the S3 object. For
                        more  information,  see Resource-Based Policies in the
                        Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.

                        Bucket -> (string)

                        Name -> (string)
                            S3 object key name.

                        Version -> (string)
                            If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can spec-
                            ify the object version.

          AutoCreate -> (boolean)
              If  specified,  Amazon  Rekognition  Custom  Labels  temporarily
              splits the training dataset (80%) to create a test dataset (20%)
              for the training job. After training completes, the test dataset
              is not stored and the training dataset reverts to  its  previous
              size.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Assets": [
              {
                "GroundTruthManifest": {
                  "S3Object": {
                    "Bucket": "string",
                    "Name": "string",
                    "Version": "string"
                  }
                }
              }
              ...
            ],
            "AutoCreate": true|false
          }

       --tags (map)
          A  set  of  tags  (key-value  pairs)  that you want to attach to the
          model.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The identifier for your AWS Key  Management  Service  key  (AWS  KMS
          key). You can supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of your KMS key,
          the ID of your KMS key, an alias for your KMS key, or an alias  ARN.
          The  key is used to encrypt training and test images copied into the
          service for model training. Your source images are  unaffected.  The
          key  is  also  used  to  encrypt training results and manifest files
          written to the output Amazon S3 bucket (OutputConfig ).

          If you choose to use your own KMS key, you need the  following  per-
          missions on the KMS key.

          o kms:CreateGrant

          o kms:DescribeKey

          o kms:GenerateDataKey

          o kms:Decrypt

          If  you  don't specify a value for KmsKeyId , images copied into the
          service are encrypted using a key that AWS owns and manages.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProjectVersionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the model version  that  was  created.  Use  DescribePro-
          jectVersion to get the current status of the training operation.
