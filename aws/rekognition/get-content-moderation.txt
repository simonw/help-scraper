GET-CONTENT-MODERATION()                              GET-CONTENT-MODERATION()



NAME
       get-content-moderation -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content analysis results
       for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis started by  StartContentModera-
       tion . For a list of moderation labels in Amazon Rekognition, see Using
       the image and video moderation APIs .

       Amazon Rekognition Video inappropriate or offensive  content  detection
       in  a  stored video is an asynchronous operation. You start analysis by
       calling  StartContentModeration which returns a job  identifier  (JobId
       ). When analysis finishes, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a comple-
       tion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic  registered
       in  the  initial call to StartContentModeration . To get the results of
       the content analysis, first check that the status  value  published  to
       the  Amazon  SNS  topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call GetContentModeration
       and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartCon-
       tentModeration .

       For  more  information,  see  Working  with Stored Videos in the Amazon
       Rekognition Devlopers Guide.
          GetContentModeration returns detected  inappropriate,  unwanted,  or
          offensive content moderation labels, and the time they are detected,
          in an array, ModerationLabels , of   ContentModerationDetection  ob-
          jects.

       By  default,  the moderated labels are returned sorted by time, in mil-
       liseconds from the start of the video. You can also sort them by moder-
       ated label by specifying NAME for the SortBy input parameter.

       Since  video  analysis  can  return  a large number of results, use the
       MaxResults parameter to limit the number of labels returned in a single
       call to GetContentModeration . If there are more results than specified
       in MaxResults , the value of NextToken in the operation  response  con-
       tains  a  pagination  token for getting the next set of results. To get
       the next page of results, call GetContentModeration  and  populate  the
       NextToken  request  parameter with the value of NextToken returned from
       the previous call to GetContentModeration .

       Developer Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            get-content-moderation
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The identifier for the inappropriate, unwanted, or offensive content
          moderation job. Use JobId to identify the job in a  subsequent  call
          to GetContentModeration .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value  greater  than
          1000,  a  maximum  of 1000 results is returned. The default value is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was incomplete (because there is more  data
          to  retrieve),  Amazon Rekognition returns a pagination token in the
          response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next set
          of content moderation labels.

       --sort-by (string)
          Sort to use for elements in the ModerationLabelDetections array. Use
          TIMESTAMP to sort array elements by the time  labels  are  detected.
          Use  NAME  to  alphabetically  group  elements for a label together.
          Within each label group, the array element are sorted  by  detection
          confidence. The default sort is by TIMESTAMP .

          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o TIMESTAMP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the results of an unsafe content operation

       The following get-content-moderation command displays the results of an
       unsafe  content  operation  that  you  started  previously  by  calling
       start-content-moderation.

          aws rekognition get-content-moderation \
              --job-id 1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef
