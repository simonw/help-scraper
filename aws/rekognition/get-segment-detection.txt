GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()                                GET-SEGMENT-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-segment-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the segment detection results of a Amazon Rekognition Video analy-
       sis started by  StartSegmentDetection .

       Segment detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  op-
       eration.  You start segment detection by calling  StartSegmentDetection
       which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the segment detection op-
       eration  finishes,  Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status to
       the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the  initial
       call  to  StartSegmentDetection . To get the results of the segment de-
       tection operation, first check that the status value published  to  the
       Amazon  SNS  topic  is  SUCCEEDED . if so, call GetSegmentDetection and
       pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call of StartSegment-
       Detection .
          GetSegmentDetection  returns detected segments in an array (Segments
          ) of  SegmentDetection objects. Segments is sorted  by  the  segment
          types specified in the SegmentTypes input parameter of StartSegment-
          Detection . Each element of the array includes the detected segment,
          the  precentage  confidence  in the acuracy of the detected segment,
          the type of the segment, and the frame in which the segment was  de-
          tected.

       Use  SelectedSegmentTypes to find out the type of segment detection re-
       quested in the call to StartSegmentDetection .

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of segment  detections
       returned.  If there are more results than specified in MaxResults , the
       value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination  to-
       ken  for  getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of re-
       sults, call GetSegmentDetection and populate the NextToken request  pa-
       rameter with the token value returned from the previous call to GetSeg-
       mentDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-segment-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Job  identifier  for the text detection operation for which you want
          results returned. You get the job identifer from an initial call  to
          StartSegmentDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Rekognition Video returns  this
          token  that  you  can  use in the subsequent request to retrieve the
          next set of text.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          codec,  the  number  of  audio  channels,  the duration of the audio

          the next set of text.
