GET-FACE-DETECTION()                                      GET-FACE-DETECTION()



NAME
       get-face-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  face  detection  results  for a Amazon Rekognition Video analysis
       started by  StartFaceDetection .

       Face detection with Amazon Rekognition Video is an asynchronous  opera-
       tion. You start face detection by calling  StartFaceDetection which re-
       turns a job identifier (JobId ). When the face detection operation fin-
       ishes,  Amazon  Rekognition  Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic registered in the initial call
       to StartFaceDetection . To get the results of the face detection opera-
       tion, first check that the status value published  to  the  Amazon  SNS
       topic  is  SUCCEEDED  .  If so, call  GetFaceDetection and pass the job
       identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartFaceDetection .
          GetFaceDetection returns an array of detected faces (Faces )  sorted
          by the time the faces were detected.

       Use  MaxResults  parameter  to  limit the number of labels returned. If
       there are more results than specified in  MaxResults  ,  the  value  of
       NextToken  in  the  operation  response contains a pagination token for
       getting the next set of results. To get the next page of results,  call
       GetFaceDetection  and populate the NextToken request parameter with the
       token value returned from the previous call to GetFaceDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            get-face-detection
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          Unique identifier for the face detection job. The JobId is  returned
          from StartFaceDetection .

       --max-results (integer)
          Maximum  number of results to return per paginated call. The largest
          value you can specify is 1000. If you specify a value  greater  than
          1000,  a  maximum  of 1000 results is returned. The default value is
          1000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          faces  to  retrieve),  Amazon Rekognition Video returns a pagination
          token in the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve
          the next set of faces.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the results of a face detection operation

       The following get-face-detection command displays the results of a face
       detection   operation   that   you   started   previously   by  calling
       start-face-detection.

                     only making a determination of the physical appearance of
                     a person's face. It is not a determination of the persons
                     internal emotional state and should not be used in such a
                     way.  For example, a person pretending to have a sad face
                     might not be sad emotionally.

                        and the confidence level in the determination. The API
                        is only making a determination of the physical appear-
                        ance  of a person's face. It is not a determination of
                        the persons internal emotional state and should not be
                        used  in  such a way. For example, a person pretending

                     attribute.

                     (structure)
                        Indicates the location of the landmark on the face.

                        Type -> (string)
                            Type of landmark.

                        X -> (float)
                            The  x-coordinate  of  the landmark expressed as a
                            ratio of the width of the image. The  x-coordinate
                            is  measured  from the left-side of the image. For
                            example, if the image is 700 pixels wide  and  the
                            x-coordinate  of  the  landmark  is at 350 pixels,
                            this value is 0.5.

                        Y -> (float)

                            is measured from the top of the image.  For  exam-
                            ple,  if  the  image  height is 200 pixels and the
                            y-coordinate of the landmark is at 50 pixels, this
                            value is 0.25.

                 Pose -> (structure)
                     Indicates  the  pose  of  the  face  as determined by its
                     pitch, roll, and yaw. Default attribute.

                     Roll -> (float)
                        Value representing the face rotation on the roll axis.

                     Yaw -> (float)
                        Value representing the face rotation on the yaw axis.

                     bute.

                     Brightness -> (float)
                        Value representing brightness of the face. The service
                        returns  a  value  between  0  and  100 (inclusive). A
                        higher value indicates a brighter face image.

                     Sharpness -> (float)
                        Value representing sharpness of the face. The  service
                        returns  a  value  between  0  and  100 (inclusive). A
                        higher value indicates a sharper face image.

                 Confidence -> (float)
                     Confidence level that the bounding box  contains  a  face
                     (and  not a different object such as a tree). Default at-
                     tribute.
