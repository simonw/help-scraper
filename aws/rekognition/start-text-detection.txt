START-TEXT-DETECTION()                                  START-TEXT-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-text-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of text in a stored video.

       Amazon Rekognition Video can detect text in a video stored in an Amazon
       S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name and  the  filename  of
       the  video.  StartTextDetection returns a job identifier (JobId ) which
       you use to get the results of the operation.  When  text  detection  is
       finished, Amazon Rekognition Video publishes a completion status to the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in  Notifica-
       tionChannel .

       To  get  the  results of the text detection operation, first check that
       the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is  SUCCEEDED  .  if
       so,  call   GetTextDetection  and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from
       the initial call to StartTextDetection .

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          Video file stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Amazon  Rekognition  video
          start operations such as  StartLabelDetection use Video to specify a
          video for analysis. The supported file formats are  .mp4,  .mov  and
          .avi.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same token with multiple StartTextDetection requests, the same JobId
          is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from be-
          ing accidentaly started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon Simple Notification Service topic to which Amazon Rekog-
          nition publishes the completion status of a  video  analysis  opera-
          tion.  For  more  information, see  api-video . Note that the Amazon
          SNS topic must have a topic name that begins with  AmazonRekognition
          if you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole permissions policy
          to access the topic. For more information, see Giving access to mul-
          tiple Amazon SNS topics .

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS  topic to which Amazon Rekognition to posts the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier  returned  in the completion status published by your
          Amazon Simple Notification Service topic. For example, you  can  use
          JobTag to group related jobs and identify them in the completion no-
          tification.

       --filters (structure)
          Optional parameters that let you set criteria the text must meet  to
          be included in your response.

          WordFilter -> (structure)
              Filters focusing on qualities of the text, such as confidence or
              size.

              MinConfidence -> (float)
                 Sets the confidence of word detection. Words  with  detection
                 confidence  below this will be excluded from the result. Val-
                 ues should be between 50 and 100 as Text in  Video  will  not
                 return any result below 50.

              MinBoundingBoxHeight -> (float)
                 Sets  the minimum height of the word bounding box. Words with
                 bounding box heights lesser than this value will be  excluded
                 from the result. Value is relative to the video frame height.

              MinBoundingBoxWidth -> (float)
                 Sets  the  minimum width of the word bounding box. Words with
                 bounding boxes widths lesser than this value will be excluded
                 from the result. Value is relative to the video frame width.

          RegionsOfInterest -> (list)
              Filter focusing on a certain area of the frame. Uses a Bounding-
              Box object to set the region of the screen.

              (structure)
                 Specifies a location within the frame that Rekognition checks
                 for  text.  Uses  a BoundingBox object to set a region of the
                 screen.

                 A word is included in the region if the  word  is  more  than
                 half  in  that  region. If there is more than one region, the
                 word will be compared with all regions  of  the  screen.  Any
                 word more than half in a region is kept in the results.

                 BoundingBox -> (structure)
                     The box representing a region of interest on screen.

                     Width -> (float)
                        Width  of  the  bounding box as a ratio of the overall
                        image width.

                     Height -> (float)
                        Height of the bounding box as a ratio of  the  overall
                        image height.

                     Left -> (float)
                        Left  coordinate  of  the  bounding  box as a ratio of
                        overall image width.

                     Top -> (float)
                        Top coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of over-
                        all image height.

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "WordFilter": {
              "MinConfidence": float,
              "MinBoundingBoxHeight": float,
              "MinBoundingBoxWidth": float
            },
            "RegionsOfInterest": [
              {
                "BoundingBox": {
                  "Width": float,
                  "Height": float,
                  "Left": float,
                  "Top": float
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          Identifier for the text detection job. Use JobId to identify the job
          in a subsequent call to GetTextDetection .
