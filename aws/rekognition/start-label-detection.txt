START-LABEL-DETECTION()                                START-LABEL-DETECTION()



NAME
       start-label-detection -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts asynchronous detection of labels in a stored video.

       Amazon  Rekognition  Video can detect labels in a video. Labels are in-
       stances of real-world entities.  This  includes  objects  like  flower,
       tree,  and  table; events like wedding, graduation, and birthday party;
       concepts like landscape, evening, and nature;  and  activities  like  a
       person getting out of a car or a person skiing.

       The  video must be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify
       the bucket name and the filename of the video. StartLabelDetection  re-
       turns a job identifier (JobId ) which you use to get the results of the
       operation. When label detection is finished, Amazon  Rekognition  Video
       publishes a completion status to the Amazon Simple Notification Service
       topic that you specify in NotificationChannel .

       To get the results of the label detection operation, first  check  that
       the  status  value  published to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If
       so, call  GetLabelDetection and pass the job identifier (JobId  )  from
       the initial call to StartLabelDetection .

SYNOPSIS
            start-label-detection
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--min-confidence <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The  video  in  which  you  want to detect labels. The video must be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the  ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent  token used to identify the start request. If you use the
          same token with multiple StartLabelDetection requests, the same  Jo-
          bId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from
          being accidently started more than once.

       --min-confidence (float)
          Specifies the minimum confidence that Amazon Rekognition Video  must
          have  in order to return a detected label. Confidence represents how
          certain Amazon Rekognition is that a label is correctly identified.0
          is  the  lowest  confidence.  100  is the highest confidence. Amazon
          Rekognition Video doesn't return any labels with a confidence  level
          lower than this specified value.

          If  you  don't  specify MinConfidence , the operation returns labels
          with confidence values greater than or equal to 50 percent.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video  to  pub-
          lish  the completion status of the label detection operation to. The
          Amazon SNS topic must have a topic name  that  begins  with  Amazon-
          Rekognition  if  you are using the AmazonRekognitionServiceRole per-
          missions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The Amazon SNS topic to which Amazon Rekognition posts the  com-
              pletion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An identifier you specify that's returned in the completion  notifi-
          cation  that's  published to your Amazon Simple Notification Service
          topic. For example, you can use JobTag to  group  related  jobs  and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect objects and scenes in a video

       The following start-label-detection command starts a job to detect  ob-
       jects  and  scenes  in  the specified video file stored in an Amazon S3
       bucket.

          aws rekognition start-label-detection \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see Detecting Labels in a  Video  in  the  Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier  for  the label detection job. Use JobId to identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetLabelDetection .
