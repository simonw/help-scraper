START-PERSON-TRACKING()                                START-PERSON-TRACKING()



NAME
       start-person-tracking -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the asynchronous tracking of a person's path in a stored video.

       Amazon Rekognition Video can track the path of people in a video stored
       in an Amazon S3 bucket. Use  Video to specify the bucket name  and  the
       filename  of  the  video.  StartPersonTracking returns a job identifier
       (JobId ) which you use to get the results of the operation. When  label
       detection is finished, Amazon Rekognition publishes a completion status
       to the Amazon Simple Notification Service topic that you specify in No-
       tificationChannel .

       To  get the results of the person detection operation, first check that
       the status value published to the Amazon SNS topic is  SUCCEEDED  .  If
       so,  call   GetPersonTracking and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from
       the initial call to StartPersonTracking .

SYNOPSIS
            start-person-tracking
          --video <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --video (structure)
          The video in which you want to detect  people.  The  video  must  be
          stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket name and file name for the video.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          Idempotent token used to identify the start request. If you use  the
          same  token with multiple StartPersonTracking requests, the same Jo-
          bId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken to prevent the same job from
          being accidently started more than once.

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The  Amazon  SNS topic ARN you want Amazon Rekognition Video to pub-
          lish the completion status of the people detection operation to. The
          Amazon  SNS  topic  must  have a topic name that begins with Amazon-
          Rekognition if you are using the  AmazonRekognitionServiceRole  per-
          missions policy.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS  topic to which Amazon Rekognition to posts the
              completion status.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that gives Amazon Rekognition  publishing
              permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's returned in the completion notifi-
          cation that's published to your Amazon Simple  Notification  Service
          topic.  For  example,  you  can use JobTag to group related jobs and
          identify them in the completion notification.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To start the pathing of people in a stored video

       The following start-person-tracking command starts a job to  track  the
       paths  that people take in the specified video fiel stored in an Amazon
       S3 bucket.:

          aws rekognition start-person-tracking \
              --video "S3Object={Bucket=MyVideoS3Bucket,Name=MyVideoFile.mpg}"

       Output:

          {
              "JobId": "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
          }

       For more information, see People Pathing in the Amazon Rekognition  De-
       veloper Guide.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          The  identifier  for the person detection job. Use JobId to identify
          the job in a subsequent call to GetPersonTracking .
