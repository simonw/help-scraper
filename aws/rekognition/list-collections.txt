LIST-COLLECTIONS()                                          LIST-COLLECTIONS()



NAME
       list-collections -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  list of collection IDs in your account. If the result is trun-
       cated, the response also provides a NextToken that you can use  in  the
       subsequent request to fetch the next set of collection IDs.

       For  an  example, see Listing Collections in the Amazon Rekognition De-
       veloper Guide.

       This operation requires permissions to perform the rekognition:ListCol-
       lections action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-collections  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CollectionIds, FaceModelVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-collections
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the available collections

       The following list-collections command lists the available  collections
       in the AWS account.

          aws rekognition list-collections

       Output:

          {
              "FaceModelVersions": [
                  "2.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "1.0",
                  "3.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "4.0",
                  "4.0"
              ],
              "CollectionIds": [
                  "MyCollection1",
                  "MyCollection2",
                  "MyCollection3",
                  "MyCollection4",
                  "MyCollection5",
                  "MyCollection6",
                  "MyCollection7",
                  "MyCollection8",
                  "MyCollection9",
                  "MyCollection10"
              ]
          }

       Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       CollectionIds -> (list)
          An array of collection IDs.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the result is truncated, the response provides a  NextToken  that
          you  can use in the subsequent request to fetch the next set of col-
          lection IDs.

       FaceModelVersions -> (list)
          Latest face models being used with the corresponding collections  in
          the array. For more information, see Model versioning . For example,
          the value of FaceModelVersions[2] is the version number for the face
          detection model used by the collection in CollectionId[2] .
