RECOGNIZE-CELEBRITIES()                                RECOGNIZE-CELEBRITIES()



NAME
       recognize-celebrities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns an array of celebrities recognized in the input image. For more
       information, see Recognizing Celebrities in the Amazon Rekognition  De-
       veloper Guide.
          RecognizeCelebrities  returns  the 64 largest faces in the image. It
          lists the recognized celebrities in the CelebrityFaces array and any
          unrecognized faces in the UnrecognizedFaces array. RecognizeCelebri-
          ties doesn't return celebrities whose faces aren't among the largest
          64 faces in the image.

       For each celebrity recognized, RecognizeCelebrities returns a Celebrity
       object. The Celebrity object contains the celebrity name, ID, URL links
       to  additional information, match confidence, and a ComparedFace object
       that you can use to locate the celebrity's face on the image.

       Amazon Rekognition doesn't retain  information  about  which  images  a
       celebrity  has been recognized in. Your application must store this in-
       formation and use the Celebrity ID property as a unique identifier  for
       the  celebrity. If you don't store the celebrity name or additional in-
       formation URLs returned by RecognizeCelebrities , you will need the  ID
       to identify the celebrity in a call to the  GetCelebrityInfo operation.

       You  pass  the input image either as base64-encoded image bytes or as a
       reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to
       call  Amazon  Rekognition  operations,  passing image bytes is not sup-
       ported. The image must be either a PNG or JPEG formatted file.

       For an example, see Recognizing Celebrities in an Image in  the  Amazon
       Rekognition Developer Guide.

       This  operation  requires permissions to perform the rekognition:Recog-
       nizeCelebrities operation.

SYNOPSIS
            recognize-celebrities
          [--image <value>]
          [--image-bytes <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --image (structure)
          The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object. If you  use
          the   AWS   CLI  to  call  Amazon  Rekognition  operations,  passing
          base64-encoded image bytes is not supported.

          If you are using an AWS SDK to call Amazon  Rekognition,  you  might
          not  need to base64-encode image bytes passed using the Bytes field.
          For more information, see Images in the Amazon Rekognition developer
          guide.

          To specify a local file use --image-bytes instead.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              Blob of image bytes up to 5 MBs.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the image source.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket.

              Name -> (string)
                 S3 object key name.

              Version -> (string)
                 If  the bucket is versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --image-bytes (blob)
          The content of the image to be uploaded. To specify the content of a
          local file use the fileb:// prefix. Example: fileb://image.png

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

                            is measured from the left-side of the  image.  For
                            example,  if  the image is 700 pixels wide and the
                            x-coordinate of the landmark  is  at  350  pixels,

                        and the confidence level in the determination. The API
                        is only making a determination of the physical appear-
                        ance of a person's face. It is not a determination  of
                        the persons internal emotional state and should not be
                        used in such a way. For example, a  person  pretending
                        to have a sad face might not be sad emotionally.

                     Left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image width.

                 Top -> (float)
                     Top  coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of overall
                     image height.

              Confidence -> (float)
                 Level of confidence that what the bounding box contains is  a
                 face.

              Landmarks -> (list)
                 An array of facial landmarks.

                 (structure)
                     Indicates the location of the landmark on the face.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of landmark.

                     X -> (float)
                        The  x-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a ratio
                        of the width of the image. The  x-coordinate  is  mea-
                        sured from the left-side of the image. For example, if
                        the image is 700 pixels wide and the  x-coordinate  of
                        the landmark is at 350 pixels, this value is 0.5.

                     Y -> (float)
                        The  y-coordinate of the landmark expressed as a ratio
                        of the height of the image. The y-coordinate  is  mea-
                        sured  from  the top of the image. For example, if the
                        image height is 200 pixels and the y-coordinate of the
                        landmark is at 50 pixels, this value is 0.25.

              Pose -> (structure)
                 Indicates  the  pose  of the face as determined by its pitch,
                 roll, and yaw.

                 Roll -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the roll axis.

                 Yaw -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the yaw axis.

                 Pitch -> (float)
                     Value representing the face rotation on the pitch axis.

              Quality -> (structure)
                 Identifies face image brightness and sharpness.

                 Brightness -> (float)
                     Value representing brightness of the  face.  The  service
                     returns  a  value between 0 and 100 (inclusive). A higher
                     value indicates a brighter face image.

                 Sharpness -> (float)
                     Value representing sharpness of the face. The service re-
                     turns  a  value  between  0 and 100 (inclusive). A higher
                     value indicates a sharper face image.

              Emotions -> (list)
                 The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and the
                 confidence  level  in the determination. Valid values include
                 "Happy",  "Sad",  "Angry",  "Confused",  "Disgusted",   "Sur-
                 prised", "Calm", "Unknown", and "Fear".

                 (structure)
                     The emotions that appear to be expressed on the face, and
                     the confidence level in the  determination.  The  API  is
                     only making a determination of the physical appearance of
                     a person's face. It is not a determination of the persons
                     internal emotional state and should not be used in such a
                     way. For example, a person pretending to have a sad  face
                     might not be sad emotionally.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of emotion detected.

                     Confidence -> (float)
                        Level of confidence in the determination.

              Smile -> (structure)
                 Indicates  whether or not the face is smiling, and the confi-
                 dence level in the determination.

                 Value -> (boolean)
                     Boolean value that indicates whether the face is  smiling
                     or not.

                 Confidence -> (float)
                     Level of confidence in the determination.

       OrientationCorrection -> (string)

          NOTE:
              Support  for estimating image orientation using the the Orienta-
              tionCorrection field has ceased as of August 2021. Any  returned
              values for this field included in an API response will always be
              NULL.

          The orientation of the input image (counterclockwise direction).  If
          your  application displays the image, you can use this value to cor-
          rect the orientation.  The  bounding  box  coordinates  returned  in
          CelebrityFaces and UnrecognizedFaces represent face locations before
          the image orientation is corrected.

          NOTE:
              If the input image is in .jpeg  format,  it  might  contain  ex-
              changeable  image (Exif) metadata that includes the image's ori-
              entation. If so, and the Exif metadata for the input image popu-
              lates  the orientation field, the value of OrientationCorrection
              is null. The CelebrityFaces and UnrecognizedFaces  bounding  box
              coordinates represent face locations after Exif metadata is used
              to correct the image orientation. Images in  .png  format  don't
              contain Exif metadata.
