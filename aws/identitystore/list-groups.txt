LIST-GROUPS()                                                    LIST-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  attribute name and value of the group that you specified in
       the search. We only support DisplayName as  a  valid  filter  attribute
       path  currently,  and  filter is required. This API returns minimum at-
       tributes, including GroupId and group DisplayName in the response.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-groups
          --identity-store-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-store-id (string)
          The globally unique identifier  for  the  identity  store,  such  as
          d-1234567890 . In this example, d- is a fixed prefix, and 1234567890
          is a randomly generated string that contains number and  lower  case
          letters.  This  value  is  generated at the time that a new identity
          store is created.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned per request.  This  pa-
          rameter  is  used in the ListUsers and ListGroups request to specify
          how many results to return in one page. The length limit is 50 char-
          acters.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token used for the ListUsers and ListGroups API oper-
          ations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is
          returned  in the API response if the total results are more than the
          size of one page. This token is also returned when it is used in the
          API request to search for the next page.

       --filters (list)
          A  list  of Filter objects, which is used in the ListUsers and List-
          Groups request.

          (structure)
              A query filter used by ListUsers and ListGroups  .  This  filter
              object provides the attribute name and attribute value to search
              users or groups.

              AttributePath -> (string)
                 The attribute path that is used to  specify  which  attribute
                 name  to search. Length limit is 255 characters. For example,
                 UserName is a valid attribute path for the ListUsers API, and
                 DisplayName is a valid attribute path for the ListGroups API.

              AttributeValue -> (string)
                 Represents the data for an attribute. Each attribute value is
                 described as a name-value pair.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributePath=string,AttributeValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributePath": "string",
              "AttributeValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Groups -> (list)
          A list of Group objects in the identity store.

          (structure)
              A  group  object, which contains a specified groups metadata and
              attributes.

              GroupId -> (string)
                 The identifier for a group in the identity store.

              DisplayName -> (string)
                 Contains the groups display name value. The length  limit  is
                 1,024 characters. This value can consist of letters, accented
                 characters, symbols, numbers,  punctuation,  tab,  new  line,
                 carriage  return, space, and nonbreaking space in this attri-
                 bute. The characters <>;:% are excluded. This value is speci-
                 fied at the time the group is created and stored as an attri-
                 bute of the group object in the identity store.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token used for the ListUsers and ListGroups API oper-
          ations. This value is generated by the identity store service. It is
          returned in the API response if the total results are more than  the
          size  of  one  page. This token is also returned when it1 is used in
          the API request to search for the next page.
