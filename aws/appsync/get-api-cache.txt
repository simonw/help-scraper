GET-API-CACHE()                                                GET-API-CACHE()



NAME
       get-api-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves an ApiCache object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-api-cache
          --api-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The API ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       apiCache -> (structure)
          The ApiCache object.

          ttl -> (long)
              TTL in seconds for cache entries.

              Valid values are 13,600 seconds.

          apiCachingBehavior -> (string)
              Caching behavior.

              o FULL_REQUEST_CACHING : All requests are fully cached.

              o PER_RESOLVER_CACHING  :  Individual resolvers that you specify
                are cached.

          transitEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
              Transit encryption flag when connecting to cache. You cannot up-
              date this setting after creation.

          atRestEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
              At-rest  encryption  flag for cache. You cannot update this set-
              ting after creation.

          type -> (string)
              The cache instance type. Valid values are

              o SMALL

              o MEDIUM

              o LARGE

              o XLARGE

              o LARGE_2X

              o LARGE_4X

              o LARGE_8X (not available in all regions)

              o LARGE_12X

              Historically, instance types were  identified  by  an  EC2-style
              value.  As  of  July  2020,  this is deprecated, and the generic
              identifiers above should be used.

              The following legacy instance types are available, but their use
              is discouraged:

              o T2_SMALL : A t2.small instance type.

              o T2_MEDIUM : A t2.medium instance type.

              o R4_LARGE : A r4.large instance type.

              o R4_XLARGE : A r4.xlarge instance type.

              o R4_2XLARGE : A r4.2xlarge instance type.

              o R4_4XLARGE : A r4.4xlarge instance type.

              o R4_8XLARGE : A r4.8xlarge instance type.

          status -> (string)
              The cache instance status.

              o AVAILABLE : The instance is available for use.

              o CREATING : The instance is currently creating.

              o DELETING : The instance is currently deleting.

              o MODIFYING : The instance is currently modifying.

              o FAILED : The instance has failed creation.
