                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function to
                     be called for  authorization.  This  can  be  a  standard
                     Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                        Note  :  This  Lambda function must have the following
                        resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring
                        Lambda  authorizers  in  the console, this is done for
                        you. To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run  the
                        following:

              a  value for authorizerResultTtlInSeconds , the default value is
              used. The maximum value is one hour (3600 seconds).  The  Lambda

                 Note : This Lambda  function  must  have  the  following  re-
                 source-based  policy  assigned to it. When configuring Lambda
                 authorizers in the console, this is done for you. To use  the
                 Command Line Interface (CLI), run the following:

       --merged-api-execution-role-arn (string)
          The  Identity  and  Access  Management service role ARN for a merged
          API. The AppSync service assumes this role on behalf of  the  Merged
          API  to  validate access to source APIs at runtime and to prompt the
          AUTO_MERGE to update the merged API endpoint  with  the  source  API
          changes automatically.

       --owner-contact (string)
          The owner contact information for an API resource.

          This field accepts any string input with a length of 0 - 256 charac-
          ters.

       --introspection-config (string)
          Sets the value of the GraphQL API to enable (ENABLED  )  or  disable
          (DISABLED  )  introspection. If no value is provided, the introspec-
          tion configuration will be set to ENABLED  by  default.  This  field
          will  produce  an  error if the operation attempts to use the intro-
          spection feature while this field is disabled.

          For more information about introspection, see GraphQL  introspection
          .

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o DISABLED

       --query-depth-limit (integer)
          The maximum depth a query can have in a single request. Depth refers
          to the amount of nested levels allowed in the body of query. The de-
          fault  value is 0 (or unspecified), which indicates there's no depth
          limit. If you set a limit, it can be between 1 and 75 nested levels.
          This  field will produce a limit error if the operation falls out of
          bounds.

          Note that fields can still be set to nullable or non-nullable. If  a
          non-nullable  field  produces an error, the error will be thrown up-
          wards to the first nullable field available.

       --resolver-count-limit (integer)
          The maximum number of resolvers that can be invoked in a single  re-
          quest.  The  default value is 0 (or unspecified), which will set the
          limit to 10000 . When specified, the limit value can  be  between  1
          and  10000  . This field will produce a limit error if the operation
          falls out of bounds.

       --enhanced-metrics-config (structure)
          The enhancedMetricsConfig object.

          resolverLevelMetricsBehavior -> (string)
              Controls how resolver metrics will be emitted to CloudWatch. Re-
              solver metrics include:

              o GraphQL errors: The number of GraphQL errors that occurred.

              o Requests: The number of invocations that occurred during a re-
                quest.

              o Latency: The time to complete a resolver invocation.

              o Cache hits: The number of cache hits during a request.

              o Cache misses: The number of cache misses during a request.

              These metrics can be emitted to CloudWatch per resolver  or  for
              all resolvers in the request. Metrics will be recorded by API ID
              and resolver name. resolverLevelMetricsBehavior accepts  one  of
              these values at a time:

              o FULL_REQUEST_RESOLVER_METRICS  : Records and emits metric data
                for all resolvers in the request.

              o PER_RESOLVER_METRICS : Records and emits metric data  for  re-
                solvers that have the metricConfig value set to ENABLED .

          dataSourceLevelMetricsBehavior -> (string)
              Controls  how data source metrics will be emitted to CloudWatch.
              Data source metrics include:

              o Requests: The number of invocations that occured during a  re-
                quest.

              o Latency: The time to complete a data source invocation.

              o Errors:  The  number  of  errors  that  occurred during a data
                source invocation.

              These metrics can be emitted to CloudWatch per  data  source  or
              for all data sources in the request. Metrics will be recorded by
              API ID and data source name. dataSourceLevelMetricsBehavior  ac-
              cepts one of these values at a time:

              o FULL_REQUEST_DATA_SOURCE_METRICS  :  Records  and emits metric
                data for all data sources in the request.

              o PER_DATA_SOURCE_METRICS : Records and emits  metric  data  for
                data sources that have the metricConfig value set to ENABLED .

          operationLevelMetricsConfig -> (string)
              Controls  how  operation  metrics will be emitted to CloudWatch.
              Operation metrics include:

              o Requests: The number of times a  specified  GraphQL  operation
                was called.

              o GraphQL  errors:  The  number  of GraphQL errors that occurred
                during a specified GraphQL operation.

              Metrics will be recorded by API ID and operation name.  You  can
              set the value to ENABLED or DISABLED .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        The  default  is 0 seconds, which disables caching. If
                        you don't specify a value  for  authorizerResultTtlIn-
                        Seconds , the default value is used. The maximum value
                        is one hour (3600 seconds). The  Lambda  function  can
                        override  this  by  returning a ttlOverride key in its
                        response.

                     authorizerUri -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda  function
                        to be called for authorization. This can be a standard
                        Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                            Note : This Lambda function must have the  follow-
                            ing  resource-based  policy  assigned  to it. When
                            configuring Lambda  authorizers  in  the  console,
                            this  is done for you. To use the Command Line In-
                            terface (CLI), run the following:

                            aws    lambda    add-permission    --function-name

              authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  seconds a response should be cached for. The
                 default is 0 seconds, which disables caching.  If  you  don't
                 specify  a  value  for authorizerResultTtlInSeconds , the de-
                 fault value is used. The maximum value is one hour (3600 sec-
                 onds).  The  Lambda function can override this by returning a
                 ttlOverride key in its response.

              authorizerUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function  to  be
                 called  for authorization. This can be a standard Lambda ARN,
                 a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                     Note : This Lambda function must have the  following  re-
                     source-based  policy  assigned  to  it.  When configuring
                     Lambda authorizers in the console, this is done for  you.
                     To  use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the follow-
                     ing:

                     aws      lambda      add-permission       --function-name
                     "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:function:my-func-
                     tion" --statement-id "appsync"  --principal  appsync.ama-

              The DNS records for the API.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          visibility -> (string)
              Sets the value of the GraphQL API to public (GLOBAL ) or private
              (PRIVATE  ). If no value is provided, the visibility will be set
              to GLOBAL by default. This value cannot be changed once the  API
              has been created.

          apiType -> (string)
              The  value  that indicates whether the GraphQL API is a standard
              API (GRAPHQL ) or merged API (MERGED ).

          mergedApiExecutionRoleArn -> (string)
              The Identity and Access Management service role ARN for a merged
              API.  The  AppSync  service  assumes  this role on behalf of the
              Merged API to validate access to source APIs at runtime  and  to
              prompt the AUTO_MERGE to update the merged API endpoint with the
              source API changes automatically.

          owner -> (string)
              The account owner of the GraphQL API.

          ownerContact -> (string)

              Sets  the  value of the GraphQL API to enable (ENABLED ) or dis-
              able (DISABLED ) introspection. If no value is provided, the in-
              trospection  configuration  will  be  set to ENABLED by default.
              This field will produce an error if the  operation  attempts  to
              use the introspection feature while this field is disabled.

              For more information about introspection, see GraphQL introspec-
              tion .

          queryDepthLimit -> (integer)
              The maximum depth a query can have in a  single  request.  Depth
              refers  to  the  amount  of nested levels allowed in the body of
              query. The default value is 0 (or unspecified), which  indicates
              there's  no depth limit. If you set a limit, it can be between 1
              and 75 nested levels. This field will produce a limit  error  if
              the operation falls out of bounds.

              Note  that  fields can still be set to nullable or non-nullable.
              If a non-nullable field produces an error,  the  error  will  be
              thrown upwards to the first nullable field available.

          resolverCountLimit -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of resolvers that can be invoked in a single
              request. The default value is 0 (or unspecified), which will set
              the  limit to 10000 . When specified, the limit value can be be-
              tween 1 and 10000 . This field will produce a limit error if the
              operation falls out of bounds.

          enhancedMetricsConfig -> (structure)
              The enhancedMetricsConfig object.

              resolverLevelMetricsBehavior -> (string)
                 Controls  how resolver metrics will be emitted to CloudWatch.
                 Resolver metrics include:

                 o GraphQL errors: The number of GraphQL errors that occurred.

                 o Requests: The number of invocations that occurred during  a
                   request.

                 o Cache hits: The number of cache hits during a request.

                 o Cache misses: The number of cache misses during a request.

                 These  metrics  can  be emitted to CloudWatch per resolver or
                 for all resolvers in the request. Metrics will be recorded by
                 API  ID  and  resolver name. resolverLevelMetricsBehavior ac-
                 cepts one of these values at a time:

                 o FULL_REQUEST_RESOLVER_METRICS : Records  and  emits  metric
                   data for all resolvers in the request.

                 o PER_RESOLVER_METRICS  :  Records  and emits metric data for
                   resolvers that have the metricConfig value set to ENABLED .

              dataSourceLevelMetricsBehavior -> (string)
                 Controls how data source metrics will be  emitted  to  Cloud-
                 Watch. Data source metrics include:

                 o Requests:  The  number of invocations that occured during a
                   request.

                 o Latency: The time to complete a data source invocation.

                 o Errors: The number of errors that occurred  during  a  data
                   source invocation.

                 These metrics can be emitted to CloudWatch per data source or
