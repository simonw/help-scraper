                     Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.

                        resource-based policy assigned to it. When configuring
                        Lambda  authorizers  in  the console, this is done for
                        you. To use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run  the
                        following:

                 identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                     A regular expression for validation of tokens before  the

          authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
              The  number  of seconds a response should be cached for. The de-
              fault is 5 minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda function can  over-
              ride  this  by  returning  a  ttlOverride key in its response. A
              value of 0 disables caching of responses.

          authorizerUri -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Lambda  function  to  be
              called  for  authorization. This can be a standard Lambda ARN, a
              version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                 Note : This Lambda  function  must  have  the  following  re-
                 source-based  policy  assigned to it. When configuring Lambda
                 authorizers in the console, this is done for you. To use  the
                 Command Line Interface (CLI), run the following:

                 aws        lambda        add-permission       --function-name

          identityValidationExpression -> (string)
              A regular expression for validation of tokens before the  Lambda
              function is called.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          authorizerResultTtlInSeconds=integer,authorizerUri=string,identityValidationExpression=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "authorizerResultTtlInSeconds": integer,
            "authorizerUri": "string",
            "identityValidationExpression": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                        turned  by  discovery  must exactly match the value of
                        iss in the ID token.

                     clientId -> (string)
                        The client identifier of  the  relying  party  at  the
                        OpenID identity provider. This identifier is typically
                        obtained when the relying party is registered with the
                        OpenID  identity  provider.  You can specify a regular
                        expression so that AppSync can validate against multi-
                        ple client identifiers at a time.

                     iatTTL -> (long)
                        The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after
                        it's issued to a user.

                     authTTL -> (long)
                        The number of milliseconds that a token is valid after
                        being authenticated.

                 userPoolConfig -> (structure)
                     The Amazon Cognito user pool configuration.

                     userPoolId -> (string)
                        The user pool ID.

                     awsRegion -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Web Services Region in which the user pool
                        was created.

                     appIdClientRegex -> (string)
                        A regular expression for validating the incoming  Ama-
                        zon  Cognito  user  pool  app client ID. If this value
                        isn't set, no filtering is applied.

                 lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
                     Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

                     authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                        The number of seconds a response should be cached for.
                        The  default  is  5  minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda
                        function can override this by returning a  ttlOverride
                        key  in its response. A value of 0 disables caching of
                        responses.

                     authorizerUri -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda  function
                        to be called for authorization. This can be a standard
                        Lambda ARN, a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                            Note : This Lambda function must have the  follow-
                            ing  resource-based  policy  assigned  to it. When
                            configuring Lambda  authorizers  in  the  console,
                            this  is done for you. To use the Command Line In-
                            terface (CLI), run the following:

                            aws    lambda    add-permission    --function-name
                            "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:func-

                            vokeFunction

                     identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                        A regular expression for validation of  tokens  before
                        the Lambda function is called.

          xrayEnabled -> (boolean)
              A  flag  indicating  whether  to  use  X-Ray  tracing  for  this
              GraphqlApi .

          wafWebAclArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the WAF access control  list  (ACL)  associated  with
              this GraphqlApi , if one exists.

          lambdaAuthorizerConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration for Lambda function authorization.

              authorizerResultTtlInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  seconds a response should be cached for. The
                 default is 5 minutes (300 seconds). The Lambda  function  can
                 override this by returning a ttlOverride key in its response.
                 A value of 0 disables caching of responses.

              authorizerUri -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function  to  be
                 called  for authorization. This can be a standard Lambda ARN,
                 a version ARN (.../v3 ), or an alias ARN.
                     Note : This Lambda function must have the  following  re-
                     source-based  policy  assigned  to  it.  When configuring
                     Lambda authorizers in the console, this is done for  you.
                     To  use the Command Line Interface (CLI), run the follow-
                     ing:

                     aws      lambda      add-permission       --function-name
                     "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:111122223333:function:my-func-

              identityValidationExpression -> (string)
                 A  regular  expression  for  validation  of tokens before the
                 Lambda function is called.
