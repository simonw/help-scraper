       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-api-key
          --api-id <value>
          --id <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--expires <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --api-id (string)
          The ID for the GraphQL API.

       --id (string)
          The API key ID.

       --description (string)
          A description of the purpose of the API key.

       --expires (long)
          From  the update time, the time after which the API key expires. The
          date is represented as seconds since the epoch.  For  more  informa-
          tion, see .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The API key.

          expires -> (long)
              The  time  after  which  the API key expires. The date is repre-
              sented as seconds since the epoch, rounded down to  the  nearest
              hour.

              The  time after which the API key is deleted. The date is repre-
