GET-STATEMENT-RESULT()                                  GET-STATEMENT-RESULT()



NAME
       get-statement-result -

DESCRIPTION
       Fetches  the  temporarily cached result of an SQL statement. A token is
       returned to page through the statement results.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-statement-result is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Records

SYNOPSIS
            get-statement-result
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the SQL statement whose results are to be fetched.
          This value is a universally unique identifier  (UUID)  generated  by
          Amazon  Redshift Data API. A suffix indicates then number of the SQL
          statement. For example, d9b6c0c9-0747-4bf4-b142-e8883122f766:2 has a
          suffix  of  :2  that  indicates  the second SQL statement of a batch
          query. This identifier is returned by  BatchExecuteStatment  ,  Exe-
          cuteStatment , and ListStatements .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ColumnMetadata -> (list)
          The properties (metadata) of a column.

          (structure)
              The properties (metadata) of a column.

              columnDefault -> (string)
                 The default value of the column.

              isCaseSensitive -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether the column is case-sensitive.

              isCurrency -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that indicates whether the column contains currency
                 values.

              isSigned -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether an integer column is signed.

              label -> (string)
                 The label for the column.

              length -> (integer)
                 The length of the column.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the column.

              nullable -> (integer)
                 A value that indicates whether the column is nullable.

              precision -> (integer)
                 The precision value of a decimal number column.

              scale -> (integer)
                 The scale value of a decimal number column.

              schemaName -> (string)
                 The name of the schema that contains the table that  includes
                 the column.

              tableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table that includes the column.

              typeName -> (string)
                 The database-specific data type of the column.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  value  that  indicates the starting point for the next set of re-
          sponse records in a subsequent request. If a value is returned in  a
          response, you can retrieve the next set of records by providing this
          returned NextToken value in the next NextToken parameter and  retry-
          ing  the  command.  If  the  NextToken  field is empty, all response
          records have been retrieved for the request.

       Records -> (list)
          The results of the SQL statement.

          (list)
              (structure)
                 A data value in a column.

                     A value of the double data type.

                 isNull -> (boolean)
                     A value that indicates whether the data is NULL.

                 longValue -> (long)
                     A value of the long data type.

                 stringValue -> (string)
                     A value of the string data type.

       TotalNumRows -> (long)
          The total number of rows in the result set returned  from  a  query.
          You  can use this number to estimate the number of calls to the Get-
