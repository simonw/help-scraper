NAME
       describe-statement -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the details about a specific instance when a query was run by
       the Amazon Redshift Data API. The information includes when  the  query
       started,  when  it  finished,  the query status, the number of rows re-
       turned, and the SQL statement.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-statement
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the SQL statement to describe.  This  value  is  a
          universally  unique  identifier  (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift
          Data API. A suffix indicates the number of the  SQL  statement.  For
          example,  d9b6c0c9-0747-4bf4-b142-e8883122f766:2  has a suffix of :2
          that indicates the second SQL statement of a batch query. This iden-
          tifier  is returned by BatchExecuteStatment , ExecuteStatement , and
          ListStatements .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The value is true if any substatement returns a result set.

       Id -> (string)

          versally unique identifier (UUID) generated by Amazon Redshift  Data
          API.

       QueryParameters -> (list)
          The parameters for the SQL statement.

              value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the parameter. Amazon Redshift implicitly con-
                 verts to the proper data type. For more inforation, see  Data

          system view.

       ResultRows -> (long)
          Either  the  number  of  rows returned from the SQL statement or the
          number of rows affected. If result size is greater  than  zero,  the
          result  rows  can  be  the number of rows affected by SQL statements
          such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, COPY, and others. A -1 indicates the
          value is null.

       ResultSize -> (long)
          The  size in bytes of the returned results. A -1 indicates the value
          is null.
