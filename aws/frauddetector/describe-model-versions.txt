OPTIONS
       --model-id (string)
          The model ID.

       --model-version-number (string)
          The model version number.

       --model-type (string)
          The model type.

          Possible values:

          o ONLINE_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

          o TRANSACTION_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

          o ACCOUNT_TAKEOVER_INSIGHTS

       --next-token (string)
          The next token from the previous results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

                 The model version number.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the model version.

                     (string)

                 labelSchema -> (structure)
                     The label schema.

                     labelMapper -> (map)
                        The label mapper maps the Amazon Fraud  Detector  sup-
                        ported model classification labels (FRAUD , LEGIT ) to
                        the appropriate event type  labels.  For  example,  if
                        "FRAUD  "  and "LEGIT " are Amazon Fraud Detector sup-
                        ported labels, this mapper could be: {"FRAUD" => ["0"]
                        , "LEGIT" => ["1"]} or {"FRAUD" => ["false"] , "LEGIT"
                        => ["true"]} or {"FRAUD" => ["fraud", "abuse"] ,  "LE-
                        GIT"  =>  ["legit",  "safe"]}  . The value part of the
                        mapper is a list, because you may have multiple  label
                        variants  from  your  event  type  for a single Amazon
                        Fraud Detector label.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (list)
                            (string)

                     unlabeledEventsTreatment -> (string)
                        The action to take for unlabeled events.

                        o Use IGNORE if you want the unlabeled  events  to  be
                          ignored.  This  is  recommended when the majority of
                          the events in the dataset are labeled.

                        o Use FRAUD if you want to  categorize  all  unlabeled
                          events  as  Fraud.  This is recommended when most of
                          the events in your dataset are fraudulent.

                        o Use LEGIT f you want  to  categorize  all  unlabeled
                          events  as  Legit.  This is recommended when most of
                          the events in your dataset are legitimate.

                        o Use AUTO if you want Amazon Fraud Detector to decide
                          how  to  use the unlabeled data. This is recommended
                          when there is significant unlabeled  events  in  the
                          dataset.

                        By  default,  Amazon  Fraud Detector ignores the unla-
                        beled data.

              externalEventsDetail -> (structure)

                                   ceptable fraud capture rate. For example, a
                                   threshold  of 500 means any model score 500
                                   or above is labeled as fraud.

                                   lected  score  threshold.  A  lower   score
                                   threshold increases the percentage of anom-
                                   alies captured by the model, but would also
                                   require  challenging a larger percentage of
                                   login events, leading to a higher  customer
                                   friction.

                               threshold -> (float)
                                   The model's threshold that specifies an ac-
                                   ceptable fraud capture rate. For example, a
                                   threshold  of 500 means any model score 500
                                   or above is labeled as fraud.

                               atodr -> (float)
                                   The account takeover discovery  rate.  This
                                   metric quantifies the percentage of account
                                   compromise events that can be  detected  by
                                   the  model at the selected score threshold.
                                   This metric is only available if 50 or more
                                   entities  with at-least one labeled account
                                   takeover event is present in  the  ingested

                            asi -> (float)
                               The  anomaly separation index (ASI) score. This
                               metric summarizes the overall  ability  of  the
                               model to separate anomalous activities from the
                               normal behavior. Depending on the  business,  a
                               large  fraction  of  these anomalous activities
                               can be malicious and correspond to the  account
                               takeover  attacks. A model with no separability
                               power will have the lowest possible  ASI  score
                               of 0.5, whereas the a model with a high separa-
                               bility power will have the highest possible ASI
                               score of 1.0
