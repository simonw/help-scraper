NAME
       describe-model-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  all of the model versions for the specified model type or for the
       specified model type and model ID. You can also get details for a  sin-
       gle, specified model version.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-model-versions
          [--model-id <value>]
          [--model-version-number <value>]
          [--model-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-id (string)
          The model ID.

       --model-version-number (string)
          The model version number.

       --model-type (string)
          The model type.

          Possible values:

          o ONLINE_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

          o TRANSACTION_FRAUD_INSIGHTS

       --next-token (string)
          The next token from the previous results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The model version details.

                 The model version number.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the model version.

              trainingDataSource -> (string)
                 The model version training data source.

              trainingDataSchema -> (structure)
                 The training data schema.

                 modelVariables -> (list)
                     The training data schema variables.

                     (string)

                 labelSchema -> (structure)
                     The label schema.

                     labelMapper -> (map)
                        The label mapper maps the Amazon Fraud  Detector  sup-
                        ported model classification labels (FRAUD , LEGIT ) to
                        the appropriate event type  labels.  For  example,  if
                        "FRAUD  "  and "LEGIT " are Amazon Fraud Detector sup-
                        ported labels, this mapper could be: {"FRAUD" => ["0"]
                        , "LEGIT" => ["1"]} or {"FRAUD" => ["false"] , "LEGIT"
                        => ["true"]} or {"FRAUD" => ["fraud", "abuse"] ,  "LE-
                        GIT"  =>  ["legit",  "safe"]}  . The value part of the
                        mapper is a list, because you may have multiple  label
                        variants  from  your  event  type  for a single Amazon

                        all  possible  model score thresholds. A model with no
                        predictive power has an AUC of 0.5, whereas a  perfect

                               old  of  500 means any model score 500 or above
                               is labeled as fraud.
