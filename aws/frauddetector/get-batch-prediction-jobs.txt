GET-BATCH-PREDICTION-JOBS()                        GET-BATCH-PREDICTION-JOBS()



NAME
       get-batch-prediction-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  all  batch prediction jobs or a specific job if you specify a job
       ID. This is a paginated API. If you provide a null maxResults, this ac-
       tion  retrieves  a  maximum  of  50  records per page. If you provide a
       maxResults, the value must be between 1 and 50. To get  the  next  page
       results,  provide  the pagination token from the GetBatchPredictionJob-
       sResponse as part of your request. A null pagination token fetches  the
       records from the beginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-batch-prediction-jobs
          [--job-id <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The batch prediction job for which to get the details.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects to return for the request.

       --next-token (string)
          The next token from the previous request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
