GET-EVENT-TYPES()                                            GET-EVENT-TYPES()



NAME
       get-event-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets all event types or a specific event type if name is provided. This
       is a paginated API. If you provide a null maxResults , this action  re-
       trieves a maximum of 10 records per page. If you provide a maxResults ,
       the value must be between 5 and 10. To get the next page results,  pro-
       vide  the  pagination  token  from the GetEventTypesResponse as part of
       your request. A null pagination token fetches the records from the  be-
       ginning.

SYNOPSIS
            get-event-types
          [--name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name.

       --next-token (string)
          The next token for the subsequent request.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects to return for the request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 If Enabled , Amazon Fraud Detector stores event data when you
                 generate a prediction and uses that data to update calculated
                 variables  in near real-time. Amazon Fraud Detector uses this
                 data, known as INGESTED_EVENTS , to train your model and  im-
                 prove fraud predictions.
