       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a commit

       The following create-commit example demonstrates how to create an  ini-
       tial commit for a repository that adds a readme.md file to a repository
       named MyDemoRepo in the main branch.

          aws codecommit create-commit \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --branch-name main \
              --put-files "filePath=readme.md,fileContent='Welcome to our team repository.'"

       Output:

          {
              "filesAdded": [
                  {
                      "blobId": "5e1c309d-EXAMPLE",
                      "absolutePath": "readme.md",
                      "fileMode": "NORMAL"
                  }
              ],
              "commitId": "4df8b524-EXAMPLE",
              "treeId": "55b57003-EXAMPLE",
              "filesDeleted": [],
              "filesUpdated": []
          }
