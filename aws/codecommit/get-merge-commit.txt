NAME
       get-merge-commit -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a specified merge commit.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-merge-commit
          --repository-name <value>
          --source-commit-specifier <value>
          --destination-commit-specifier <value>
          [--conflict-detail-level <value>]
          [--conflict-resolution-strategy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  repository  that contains the merge commit about
          which you want to get information.

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The level of conflict detail to use.  If  unspecified,  the  default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict  is  considered  not  mergeable  if  the  same file in both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts,  or  whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get detailed information about a merge commit

       The  following  get-merge-commit example displays details about a merge
       commit for the source branch named bugfix-bug1234  with  a  destination
       branch  named  main  using the THREE_WAY_MERGE strategy in a repository
       named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-merge-commit \
              --source-commit-specifier bugfix-bug1234 \
              --destination-commit-specifier main \
              --merge-option THREE_WAY_MERGE \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "sourceCommitId": "c5709475EXAMPLE",
              "destinationCommitId": "317f8570EXAMPLE",
              "baseCommitId": "fb12a539EXAMPLE",
              "mergeCommitId": "ffc4d608eEXAMPLE"
          }

       For more information, see View Commit Details  in  the  AWS  CodeCommit
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       sourceCommitId -> (string)
          The  commit  ID  of the source commit specifier that was used in the
          merge evaluation.

       destinationCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the destination commit specifier that was  used  in
          the merge evaluation.

       baseCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the merge base.

       mergedCommitId -> (string)
          The  commit  ID  for the merge commit created when the source branch
          was merged into the destination branch. If  the  fast-forward  merge
          strategy was used, there is no merge commit.
