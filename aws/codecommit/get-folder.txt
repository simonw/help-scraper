GET-FOLDER()                                                      GET-FOLDER()



NAME
       get-folder -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the contents of a specified folder in a repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-folder
          --repository-name <value>
          [--commit-specifier <value>]
          --folder-path <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository.

       --commit-specifier (string)
          A  fully qualified reference used to identify a commit that contains
          the version of the folder's content to  return.  A  fully  qualified
          reference can be a commit ID, branch name, tag, or reference such as
          HEAD. If no specifier is provided, the folder content is returned as
          it exists in the HEAD commit.

       --folder-path (string)
          The  fully qualified path to the folder whose contents are returned,
          including the folder name. For example, /examples is a  fully-quali-
          fied  path  to  a  folder named examples that was created off of the
          root directory (/) of a repository.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the contents of a folder in an AWS CodeCommit repository

       The following get-folder example demonstrates how to get  the  contents
       of a top-level folder from a repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-folder --repository-name MyDemoRepo --folder-path ""

       Output:
