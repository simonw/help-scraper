          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of the repository where you want to post a comment on the
          comparison between commits.

       --before-commit-id (string)
          To establish the directionality of the comparison, the  full  commit
          ID  of  the before commit. Required for commenting on any commit un-
          less that commit is the initial commit.

       --after-commit-id (string)
          To establish the directionality of the comparison, the  full  commit
          ID of the after commit.

       --location (structure)
          The location of the comparison where you want to comment.

          filePath -> (string)
              The name of the file being compared, including its extension and
              subdirectory, if any.

          filePosition -> (long)
              The position of a change in a compared file, in line number for-
              mat.

          relativeFileVersion -> (string)
              In a comparison of commits or a pull request, whether the change
              is in the before or after of that comparison.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filePath=string,filePosition=long,relativeFileVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filePath": "string",
            "filePosition": long,
            "relativeFileVersion": "BEFORE"|"AFTER"
          }

       --content (string)
          The content of the comment you want to make.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided  in
          a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed pa-
          rameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a to-
          ken  is  included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a comment on a commit

       This  example  demonstrates  how to add the comment "Can you add a test
       case for this?" on the change to the cl_sample.js file in the  compari-
       son between two commits in a repository named MyDemoRepo.

              --client-request-token 123Example \
              --content "Can you add a test case for this?" \
              --location filePath=cl_sample.js,filePosition=1232,relativeFileVersion=AFTER
