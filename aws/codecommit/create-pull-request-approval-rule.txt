NAME
       create-pull-request-approval-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an approval rule for a pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-pull-request-approval-rule
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --approval-rule-name <value>
          --approval-rule-content <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of the pull request for which you want to
          create the approval rule.

       --approval-rule-name (string)
          The name for the approval rule.

       --approval-rule-content (string)
          The content of the approval rule, including the number of  approvals
          needed  and the structure of an approval pool defined for approvals,
          if any. For more information about approval pools, see the AWS Code-
          Commit User Guide.

          NOTE:
              When  you create the content of the approval rule, you can spec-
              ify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

              o CodeCommitApprovers : This option only requires an AWS account
                and  a  resource. It can be used for both IAM users and feder-
                ated access users whose name  matches  the  provided  resource
                name.  This is a very powerful option that offers a great deal
                of flexibility. For example, if you specify  the  AWS  account
                123456789012  and  Mary_Major  , all of the following would be
                counted as approvals coming from that user:

                o An  IAM  user  in  the  account   (arn:aws:iam::123456789012
                  :user/Mary_Major )

                o A   federated   user   identified   in   IAM  as  Mary_Major
                  (arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major )

              This option does not recognize an active session of someone  as-
              suming  the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name of
              Mary_Major   (arn:aws:sts::123456789012   :assumed-role/CodeCom-
              mitReview/Mary_Major ) unless you include a wildcard (
              *
              Mary_Major).

              o Fully  qualified  ARN  : This option allows you to specify the
                fully qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user  or
                role.

              For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an approval rule for a pull request

       The following create-pull-request-approval-rule example creates an  ap-
       proval  rule  named   Require  two approved approvers for the specified
       pull request. The rule specifies that two approvals are  required  from
       an  approval pool. The pool includes all users who access CodeCommit by
       assuming the role of  CodeCommitReview in the 123456789012 AWS account.
       It   also   includes  either  an  IAM  user  or  federated  user  named
       Nikhil_Jayashankar from the same AWS account.
