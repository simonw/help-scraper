GET-COMMENTS-FOR-PULL-REQUEST()                GET-COMMENTS-FOR-PULL-REQUEST()



NAME
       get-comments-for-pull-request -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns comments made on a pull request.

       NOTE:
          Reaction  counts might include numbers from user identities who were
          deleted after the reaction was made. For a count of  reactions  from
          active identities, use GetCommentReactions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-comments-for-pull-request  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: commentsForPullRequestData

SYNOPSIS
            get-comments-for-pull-request
          --pull-request-id <value>
          [--repository-name <value>]
          [--before-commit-id <value>]
          [--after-commit-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request. To  get  this  ID,  use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the pull request.

       --before-commit-id (string)
          The  full commit ID of the commit in the destination branch that was
          the tip of the branch at the time the pull request was created.

       --after-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the commit in the source branch that  was  the
          tip of the branch at the time the comment was made.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view comments for a pull request

       This example demonstrates how to view comments for a pull request in  a
       repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-comments-for-pull-request \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --before-commit-ID 317f8570EXAMPLE \
              --after-commit-id 5d036259EXAMPLE

       Output:

                        received  with  the same parameters and a token is in-
                        cluded, the request returns information about the ini-
                        tial request that used that token.

                        individual users who have responded to a comment  with
                        the specified reactions.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (integer)

       nextToken -> (string)
          An  enumeration  token  that  can be used in a request to return the
          next batch of the results.
