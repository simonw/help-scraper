GET-MERGE-OPTIONS()                                        GET-MERGE-OPTIONS()



NAME
       get-merge-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the merge options available for merging two
       specified branches. For details about why a merge option is not  avail-
       able, use GetMergeConflicts or DescribeMergeConflicts.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-merge-options
          --repository-name <value>
          --source-commit-specifier <value>
          --destination-commit-specifier <value>
          [--conflict-detail-level <value>]
          [--conflict-resolution-strategy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the commits about which you
          want to get merge options.

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The level of conflict detail to use.  If  unspecified,  the  default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict  is  considered  not  mergeable  if  the  same file in both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts,  or  whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  information  about the merge options available for merging two
       specified branches

       The following get-merge-options example determines  the  merge  options
       available  for merging a source branch named bugfix-bug1234 with a des-
       tination branch named main in a repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-merge-options \
              --source-commit-specifier bugfix-bug1234 \
              --destination-commit-specifier main \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "mergeOptions": [
                  "FAST_FORWARD_MERGE",
                  "SQUASH_MERGE",
                  "THREE_WAY_MERGE"
              ],
              "sourceCommitId": "18059494EXAMPLE",
              "destinationCommitId": "ffd3311dEXAMPLE",
              "baseCommitId": "ffd3311dEXAMPLE"
          }

       AWS CodeCommit User Guide.

OUTPUT
       mergeOptions -> (list)
          The merge option or strategy used to merge the code.

          (string)

       sourceCommitId -> (string)
          The  commit  ID  of the source commit specifier that was used in the
          merge evaluation.

       destinationCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the destination commit specifier that was  used  in
          the merge evaluation.

       baseCommitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the merge base.
