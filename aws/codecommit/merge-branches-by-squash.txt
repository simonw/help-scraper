OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to merge two branches.

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --target-branch (string)
          The branch where the merge is applied.

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The  level  of  conflict  detail to use. If unspecified, the default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict is considered not  mergeable  if  the  same  file  in  both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies  which  branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --author-name (string)
          The name of the author who created the commit. This  information  is
          used as both the author and committer for the commit.

       --email (string)
          The  email address of the person merging the branches. This informa-
          tion is used in the commit information for the merge.

       --commit-message (string)
          The commit message for the merge.

       --keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders (boolean)
          If the commit contains deletions, whether to keep a folder or folder
          structure  if the changes leave the folders empty. If this is speci-
          fied as true, a .gitkeep file is created for empty folders. The  de-
          fault is false.

       --conflict-resolution (structure)
          If  AUTOMERGE  is the conflict resolution strategy, a list of inputs
          to use when resolving conflicts during a merge.

              resolution.

              (structure)
                 Information about a replacement content entry in the conflict

                     The replacement type to use when determining how  to  re-
                     solve the conflict.

                 content -> (blob)
                     The  base-64  encoded content to use when the replacement
                     type is USE_NEW_CONTENT.

                 fileMode -> (string)
                     The file mode to apply during conflict resoltion.

          deleteFiles -> (list)
              Files to be deleted as part of the merge conflict resolution.

              (structure)

                 filePath -> (string)
                     The full path of the file to be  deleted,  including  the
                     name of the file.

          setFileModes -> (list)
              File  modes  that  are set as part of the merge conflict resolu-
              tion.

                 Information about the file mode changes.

                 filePath -> (string)
                     The full path to the file,  including  the  name  of  the
                     file.

                 fileMode -> (string)
                     The file mode for the file.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          replaceContents=[{filePath=string,replacementType=string,content=blob,fileMode=string},{filePath=string,replacementType=string,content=blob,fileMode=string}],deleteFiles=[{filePath=string},{filePath=string}],setFileModes=[{filePath=string,fileMode=string},{filePath=string,fileMode=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "replaceContents": [
              {
                "filePath": "string",
                "replacementType": "KEEP_BASE"|"KEEP_SOURCE"|"KEEP_DESTINATION"|"USE_NEW_CONTENT",
                "content": blob,
                "fileMode": "EXECUTABLE"|"NORMAL"|"SYMLINK"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "deleteFiles": [
              {
                "filePath": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "setFileModes": [
              {
                "filePath": "string",
                "fileMode": "EXECUTABLE"|"NORMAL"|"SYMLINK"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To merge two branches using the squash merge strategy

       The  following  merge-branches-by-squash  example  merges the specified
       source branch with the specified destination  branch  in  a  repository
       named MyDemoRepo.

              --destination-commit-specifier bugfix-bug1233 \
              --author-name "Maria Garcia" \
              --email "maria_garcia@example.com" \
              --commit-message "Merging two fix branches to prepare for a general patch." \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo

       Output:

          {
              "commitId": "4f178133EXAMPLE",
              "treeId": "389765daEXAMPLE"
          }

       Commit User Guide.

OUTPUT
       commitId -> (string)
          The commit ID of the merge in the destination or target branch.

       treeId -> (string)
