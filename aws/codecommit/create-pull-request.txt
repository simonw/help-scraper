SYNOPSIS
            create-pull-request
          --title <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --targets <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --title (string)
          The  title  of  the pull request. This title is used to identify the
          pull request to other users in the repository.

       --description (string)
          A description of the pull request.

       --targets (list)
          The targets for the pull request, including the source of  the  code
          to  be  reviewed  (the  source branch) and the destination where the
          creator of the pull request intends the code to be merged after  the
          pull request is closed (the destination branch).

          (structure)
              Returns information about a target for a pull request.

              repositoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the repository that contains the pull request.

              sourceReference -> (string)
                 The  branch  of  the repository that contains the changes for
                 the pull request. Also known as the source branch.

              destinationReference -> (string)
                 The branch of the repository where the pull  request  changes
                 are merged. Also known as the destination branch.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          repositoryName=string,sourceReference=string,destinationReference=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "repositoryName": "string",
              "sourceReference": "string",
              "destinationReference": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided in
          a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed pa-
          rameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a to-
          ken is included, the request returns information about  the  initial
          request that used that token.

          NOTE:
              The AWS SDKs prepopulate client request tokens. If you are using
              an AWS SDK, an idempotency token is created for you.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a pull request

       The following create-pull-request example creates a pull request  named
       'Pronunciation  difficulty  analyzer' with a description of 'Please re-
       view these changes by Tuesday' that targets  the  'jane-branch'  source
       branch and is to be merged to the default branch 'main' in an AWS Code-
       Commit repository named 'MyDemoRepo'.

          aws codecommit create-pull-request \
              --title "My Pull Request" \
              --description "Please review these changes by Tuesday" \
              --client-request-token 123Example \
              --targets repositoryName=MyDemoRepo,sourceReference=MyNewBranch
