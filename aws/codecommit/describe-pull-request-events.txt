DESCRIBE-PULL-REQUEST-EVENTS()                  DESCRIBE-PULL-REQUEST-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-pull-request-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about one or more pull request events.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-pull-request-events  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: pullRequestEvents

SYNOPSIS
            describe-pull-request-events
          --pull-request-id <value>
          [--pull-request-event-type <value>]
          [--actor-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request. To  get  this  ID,  use
          ListPullRequests .

       --pull-request-event-type (string)
          Optional. The pull request event type about which you want to return
          information.

          Possible values:

          o PULL_REQUEST_CREATED

          o PULL_REQUEST_STATUS_CHANGED

          o PULL_REQUEST_SOURCE_REFERENCE_UPDATED

          o PULL_REQUEST_MERGE_STATE_CHANGED

          o PULL_REQUEST_APPROVAL_RULE_CREATED

          o PULL_REQUEST_APPROVAL_RULE_UPDATED

          o PULL_REQUEST_APPROVAL_RULE_DELETED

          o PULL_REQUEST_APPROVAL_RULE_OVERRIDDEN

          o PULL_REQUEST_APPROVAL_STATE_CHANGED

       --actor-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user whose actions resulted in
          the event. Examples include updating the pull request with more com-
          mits or changing the status of a pull request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view events in a pull request

       The following describe-pull-request-events example retrieves the events
       for a pull request with the ID of '8'.

          aws codecommit describe-pull-request-events --pull-request-id 8
