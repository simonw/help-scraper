       put-comment-reaction -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates  a reaction to a specified comment for the user whose
       identity is used to make the request. You can only add or update a  re-
       action  for  yourself. You cannot add, modify, or delete a reaction for
       another user.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-comment-reaction
          --comment-id <value>
          --reaction-value <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --comment-id (string)
          The ID of the comment to which you want to add or update a reaction.

       --reaction-value (string)
          The emoji reaction you want to add or update. To remove a  reaction,
          provide  a value of blank or null. You can also provide the value of
          none. For information about emoji reaction values supported  in  AWS
          CodeCommit, see the AWS CodeCommit User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
