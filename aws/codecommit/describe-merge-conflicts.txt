DESCRIBE-MERGE-CONFLICTS()                          DESCRIBE-MERGE-CONFLICTS()



NAME
       describe-merge-conflicts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about one or more merge conflicts in the attempted
       merge of two commit specifiers using  the  squash  or  three-way  merge
       strategy.  If  the merge option for the attempted merge is specified as
       FAST_FORWARD_MERGE, an exception is thrown.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-merge-conflicts
          --repository-name <value>
          --destination-commit-specifier <value>
          --source-commit-specifier <value>
          --merge-option <value>
          [--max-merge-hunks <value>]
          --file-path <value>
          [--conflict-detail-level <value>]
          [--conflict-resolution-strategy <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to get information about a
          merge conflict.

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --merge-option (string)
          The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code.

          Possible values:

          o FAST_FORWARD_MERGE

          o SQUASH_MERGE

          o THREE_WAY_MERGE

       --max-merge-hunks (integer)
          The maximum number of merge hunks to include in the output.

       --file-path (string)
          The path of the target files used to describe the conflicts.

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The  level  of  conflict  detail to use. If unspecified, the default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict is considered not  mergeable  if  the  same  file  in  both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies  which  branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --next-token (string)
          An enumeration token that, when provided in a request,  returns  the
          next batch of the results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get detailed information about merge conflicts

       The  following  describe-merge-conflicts  example  determines the merge
       conflicts for a file named readme.md in the specified source branch and
       destination branch using the THREE_WAY_MERGE strategy.

          next batch of the results.
