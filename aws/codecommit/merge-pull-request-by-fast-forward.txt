NAME
       merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  merge the source commit of a pull request into the speci-
       fied destination branch for that pull request at the  specified  commit
       using  the  fast-forward merge strategy. If the merge is successful, it
       closes the pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --repository-name <value>
          [--source-commit-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request. To  get  this  ID,  use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

       --source-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the original or updated commit in the pull re-
          quest source branch. Pass this value if you want an exception thrown
          if  the  current  commit ID of the tip of the source branch does not
          match this commit ID.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To merge and close a pull request

       This example demonstrates how to merge and close a  pull  request  with
       the ID of '47' and a source commit ID of '99132ab0EXAMPLE' in a reposi-
       tory named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit merge-pull-request-by-fast-forward \
              --pull-request-id 47 \
              --source-commit-id 99132ab0EXAMPLE \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo
