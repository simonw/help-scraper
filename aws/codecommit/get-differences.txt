GET-DIFFERENCES()                                            GET-DIFFERENCES()



NAME
       get-differences -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the differences in a valid commit specifier
       (such as a branch, tag, HEAD, commit ID, or other fully qualified  ref-
       erence). Results can be limited to a specified path.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-differences is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: differences

SYNOPSIS
            get-differences
          --repository-name <value>
          [--before-commit-specifier <value>]
          --after-commit-specifier <value>
          [--before-path <value>]
          [--after-path <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to get differences.

       --before-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify  a  commit  (for example, the full commit ID). Optional. If
          not specified, all changes before the afterCommitSpecifier value are
          shown. If you do not use beforeCommitSpecifier in your request, con-
          sider limiting the results with maxResults .

       --after-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit.

       --before-path (string)
          The  file path in which to check for differences. Limits the results
          to this path. Can also be used to specify the previous name of a di-
          rectory  or  folder.  If beforePath and afterPath are not specified,
          differences are shown for all paths.

       --after-path (string)
          The file path in which to check differences. Limits the  results  to
          this  path. Can also be used to specify the changed name of a direc-
          tory or folder, if it has changed. If not specified, differences are
          shown for all paths.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about differences for a commit specifier in a repos-
       itory

       This  example shows view metadata information about changes between two
       commit specifiers (branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully  qualified  refer-
       ences, such as commit IDs) in a renamed folder in AWS CodeCommit repos-
       itory named MyDemoRepo. The example includes several options  that  are
       not  required,  including --before-commit-specifier, --before-path, and
       --after-path, in order to more fully illustrate how you can  use  these
       options  to  limit the results. The response includes file mode permis-
       sions.

       Command:

          aws codecommit get-differences --repository-name MyDemoRepo --before-commit-specifier 955bba12thisisanexamplethisisanexample --after-commit-specifier 14a95463thisisanexamplethisisanexample --before-path tmp/example-folder --after-path tmp/renamed-folder

       Output:
