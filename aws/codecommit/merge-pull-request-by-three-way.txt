NAME
       merge-pull-request-by-three-way -

DESCRIPTION
       Attempts  to  merge the source commit of a pull request into the speci-
       fied destination branch for that pull request at the  specified  commit
       using  the  three-way  merge  strategy.  If the merge is successful, it
       closes the pull request.

SYNOPSIS
            merge-pull-request-by-three-way
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --repository-name <value>
          [--source-commit-id <value>]
          [--conflict-detail-level <value>]
          [--conflict-resolution-strategy <value>]
          [--commit-message <value>]
          [--author-name <value>]
          [--email <value>]
          [--keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders]
          [--conflict-resolution <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The system-generated ID of the pull request. To  get  this  ID,  use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

       --source-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the original or updated commit in the pull re-
          quest source branch. Pass this value if you want an exception thrown
          if  the  current  commit ID of the tip of the source branch does not
          match this commit ID.

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The level of conflict detail to use.  If  unspecified,  the  default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict  is  considered  not  mergeable  if  the  same file in both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts,  or  whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --commit-message (string)
          The  commit  message  to  include  in the commit information for the
          merge.

       --author-name (string)
          The name of the author who created the commit. This  information  is
          used as both the author and committer for the commit.

       --email (string)
          The  email address of the person merging the branches. This informa-
          tion is used in the commit information for the merge.

       --keep-empty-folders | --no-keep-empty-folders (boolean)
          If the commit contains deletions, whether to keep a folder or folder
          structure  if  the changes leave the folders empty. If true, a .git-
          keep file is created for empty folders. The default is false.

                 content -> (blob)
                     The base-64 encoded content to use when  the  replacement

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "replaceContents": [
              {
                "filePath": "string",
                "replacementType": "KEEP_BASE"|"KEEP_SOURCE"|"KEEP_DESTINATION"|"USE_NEW_CONTENT",
                "content": blob,
                "fileMode": "EXECUTABLE"|"NORMAL"|"SYMLINK"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "deleteFiles": [
              {
                "filePath": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "setFileModes": [

              }
              ...

          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
