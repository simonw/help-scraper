EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set up the credential helper included in the AWS CLI with AWS  Code-
       Commit

       The  credential-helper  utility  is  not designed to be called directly
       from the AWS CLI. Instead it is intended to be used as a parameter with
       the git config command to set up your local computer. It enables Git to
       use HTTPS and a cryptographically signed version of your IAM user  cre-
       dentials or Amazon EC2 instance role whenever Git needs to authenticate
       with AWS to interact with CodeCommit repositories.

          git config --global credential.helper '!aws codecommit credential-helper $@'
          git config --global credential.UseHttpPath true

       Output:

          [credential]
              helper = !aws codecommit credential-helper $@
              UseHttpPath = true
