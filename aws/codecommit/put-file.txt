DESCRIPTION
       Adds or updates a file in a branch in an AWS CodeCommit repository, and

SYNOPSIS
            put-file
          --repository-name <value>
          --branch-name <value>
          --file-content <value>
          --file-path <value>
          [--file-mode <value>]
          [--parent-commit-id <value>]
          [--commit-message <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--email <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to add or update the file.

       --branch-name (string)
          The name of the branch where you want to add or update the file.  If
          this is an empty repository, this branch is created.

       --file-content (blob)
          The content of the file, in binary object format.

       --file-path (string)
          The  name of the file you want to add or update, including the rela-
          tive path to the file in the repository.

          NOTE:
              If the path does not currently exist in the repository, the path
              is created as part of adding the file.

       --file-mode (string)
          The  file  mode permissions of the blob. Valid file mode permissions
          are listed here.

          Possible values:

          o EXECUTABLE

          o NORMAL

          o SYMLINK

       --parent-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the head commit in the branch where  you  want
          to add or update the file. If this is an empty repository, no commit
          ID is required. If this is not an empty repository, a commit  ID  is
          required.

          The  commit  ID  must match the ID of the head commit at the time of
          the operation. Otherwise, an error occurs, and the file is not added
          or updated.

       --commit-message (string)
          A  message  about why this file was added or updated. Although it is
          optional, a message makes the commit  history  for  your  repository
          more useful.

       --name (string)
          The  name  of the person adding or updating the file. Although it is
          optional, a name makes the commit history for your  repository  more
          useful.

       --email (string)
          An email address for the person adding or updating the file.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a file to a repository

       The  following  put-file example adds a file named 'ExampleSolution.py'
       to a repository named 'MyDemoRepo' to a branch  named  'feature-random-
       izationfeature'  whose  most  recent commit has an ID of '4c925148EXAM-
       PLE'.

          aws codecommit put-file \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --branch-name feature-randomizationfeature \
              --file-content fileb://MyDirectory/ExampleSolution.py \
              --file-path /solutions/ExampleSolution.py \
              --parent-commit-id 4c925148EXAMPLE \
              --name "Maria Garcia" \
              --email "maria_garcia@example.com" \
              --commit-message "I added a third randomization routine."

       Output:

          {
              "blobId": "2eb4af3bEXAMPLE",
              "commitId": "317f8570EXAMPLE",
              "treeId": "347a3408EXAMPLE"
          }

OUTPUT
       commitId -> (string)
          The full SHA ID of the commit that contains this file change.

       blobId -> (string)
          The ID of the blob, which is its SHA-1 pointer.

       treeId -> (string)
          The full SHA-1 pointer of the tree information for the  commit  that
          contains this file change.
