CREATE-APPROVAL-RULE-TEMPLATE()                CREATE-APPROVAL-RULE-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       create-approval-rule-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a template for approval rules that can then be associated with
       one or more repositories in your AWS account. When you associate a tem-
       plate  with  a repository, AWS CodeCommit creates an approval rule that
       matches the conditions of the template for all pull requests that  meet
       the conditions of the template. For more information, see  AssociateAp-
       provalRuleTemplateWithRepository .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-approval-rule-template
          --approval-rule-template-name <value>
          --approval-rule-template-content <value>
          [--approval-rule-template-description <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --approval-rule-template-name (string)
          The name of the approval rule template. Provide  descriptive  names,
          because this name is applied to the approval rules created automati-
          cally in associated repositories.

       --approval-rule-template-content (string)
          The content of the approval rule that is created on pull requests in
          associated repositories. If you specify one or more destination ref-
          erences (branches), approval rules  are  created  in  an  associated
          repository  only  if  their  destination references (branches) match
          those specified in the template.

          NOTE:
              When you create the content of the approval rule  template,  you
              can specify approvers in an approval pool in one of two ways:

              o CodeCommitApprovers : This option only requires an AWS account
                and a resource. It can be used for both IAM users  and  feder-
                ated  access  users  whose  name matches the provided resource
                name. This is a very powerful option that offers a great  deal
                of  flexibility.  For  example, if you specify the AWS account
                123456789012 and Mary_Major , all of the following are counted
                as approvals coming from that user:

                o An   IAM  user  in  the  account  (arn:aws:iam::123456789012
                  :user/Mary_Major )

                o A  federated  user   identified   in   IAM   as   Mary_Major
                  (arn:aws:sts::123456789012 :federated-user/Mary_Major )

              This  option does not recognize an active session of someone as-
              suming the role of CodeCommitReview with a role session name  of
              Mary_Major   (arn:aws:sts::123456789012   :assumed-role/CodeCom-
              mitReview/Mary_Major ) unless you include a wildcard (
              *
              Mary_Major).

              o Fully qualified ARN : This option allows you  to  specify  the
                fully  qualified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM user or
                role.

              For more information about IAM ARNs, wildcards, and formats, see
              IAM Identifiers in the IAM User Guide .

       --approval-rule-template-description (string)
          The  description of the approval rule template. Consider providing a
          description that explains what this template does and when it  might
          be appropriate to associate it with repositories.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an approval rule template

       The following create-approval-rule-template example creates an approval
       rule template named 2-approver-rule-for-main ``. The template  requires
       two users who assume the role of ``CodeCommitReview to approve any pull
       request before it can be merged to the main branch.

          aws codecommit create-approval-rule-template \
              --approval-rule-template-name 2-approver-rule-for-main \
              --approval-rule-template-description  "Requires two developers from the team to approve the pull request if the destination branch is main" \
              --approval-rule-template-content "{\"Version\": \"2018-11-08\",\"DestinationReferences\": [\"refs/heads/main\"],\"Statements\": [{\"Type\": \"Approvers\",\"NumberOfApprovalsNeeded\": 2,\"ApprovalPoolMembers\": [\"arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/*\"]}]}"

       Output:

          {
              "approvalRuleTemplate": {
                  "approvalRuleTemplateName": "2-approver-rule-for-main",
                  "creationDate": 1571356106.936,
                  "approvalRuleTemplateId": "dd8b17fe-EXAMPLE",
                  "approvalRuleTemplateContent": "{\"Version\": \"2018-11-08\",\"DestinationReferences\": [\"refs/heads/main\"],\"Statements\": [{\"Type\": \"Approvers\",\"NumberOfApprovalsNeeded\": 2,\"ApprovalPoolMembers\": [\"arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/CodeCommitReview/*\"]}]}",
                  "lastModifiedUser": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/Mary_Major",
                  "approvalRuleTemplateDescription": "Requires two developers from the team to approve the pull request if the destination branch is main",
                  "lastModifiedDate": 1571356106.936,
                  "ruleContentSha256": "4711b576EXAMPLE"
              }
          }
