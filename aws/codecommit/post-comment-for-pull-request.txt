OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of  the pull request. To get this ID, use
          ListPullRequests .

       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where you want to post  a  comment  on  a
          pull request.

       --before-commit-id (string)
          The  full commit ID of the commit in the destination branch that was
          the tip of the branch at the time the pull request was created.

       --after-commit-id (string)
          The full commit ID of the commit in the source branch  that  is  the
          current  tip  of  the  branch for the pull request when you post the
          comment.

       --location (structure)
          The location of the change where you want to post your  comment.  If
          no  location is provided, the comment is posted as a general comment
          on the pull request difference between the before commit ID and  the
          after commit ID.

          filePath -> (string)
              The name of the file being compared, including its extension and
              subdirectory, if any.

          filePosition -> (long)
              The position of a change in a compared file, in line number for-
              mat.

          relativeFileVersion -> (string)
              In a comparison of commits or a pull request, whether the change
              is in the before or after of that comparison.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          filePath=string,filePosition=long,relativeFileVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "filePath": "string",
            "filePosition": long,
            "relativeFileVersion": "BEFORE"|"AFTER"
          }

       --content (string)
          The content of your comment on the change.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique, client-generated idempotency token that, when provided  in
          a request, ensures the request cannot be repeated with a changed pa-
          rameter. If a request is received with the same parameters and a to-
          ken  is  included, the request returns information about the initial
          request that used that token.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To add a comment to a pull request

       The following post-comment-for-pull-request example  adds  the  comment
       "These  don't  appear  to be used anywhere. Can we remove them?" on the
       change to the ahs_count.py file in a pull request with the ID of 47  in
       a repository named MyDemoRepo.

              --content "These don't appear to be used anywhere. Can we remove them?" \
