NAME
       get-merge-conflicts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about merge conflicts between the before and after
       commit IDs for a pull request in a repository.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-merge-conflicts
          --repository-name <value>
          --destination-commit-specifier <value>
          --source-commit-specifier <value>
          --merge-option <value>
          [--conflict-detail-level <value>]
          [--max-conflict-files <value>]
          [--conflict-resolution-strategy <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The name of the repository where the pull request was created.

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --merge-option (string)
          The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code.

          Possible values:

          o FAST_FORWARD_MERGE

          o SQUASH_MERGE

          o THREE_WAY_MERGE

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The level of conflict detail to use.  If  unspecified,  the  default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict  is  considered  not  mergeable  if  the  same file in both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --max-conflict-files (integer)
          The maximum number of files to include in the output.

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies which branch to use when resolving conflicts,  or  whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --next-token (string)
          An  enumeration  token that, when provided in a request, returns the
          next batch of the results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view whether there are any merge conflicts for a pull request

       The following get-merge-conflicts example displays  whether  there  are
       any  merge  conflicts  between  the  tip  of a source branch named fea-
       ture-randomizationfeature and a destination branch named  'main'  in  a
       repository named MyDemoRepo.

          aws codecommit get-merge-conflicts \
              --repository-name MyDemoRepo \
              --source-commit-specifier feature-randomizationfeature \
              --destination-commit-specifier main \
              --merge-option THREE_WAY_MERGE
