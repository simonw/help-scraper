          --destination-commit-specifier <value>
          --source-commit-specifier <value>
          --merge-option <value>
          [--max-merge-hunks <value>]
          [--max-conflict-files <value>]
          [--file-paths <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --repository-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  repository that contains the merge conflicts you
          want to review.

       --destination-commit-specifier (string)
          The branch, tag, HEAD, or other fully qualified  reference  used  to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --source-commit-specifier (string)
          The  branch,  tag,  HEAD, or other fully qualified reference used to
          identify a commit (for example, a branch name or a full commit ID).

       --merge-option (string)
          The merge option or strategy you want to use to merge the code.

          Possible values:

          o FAST_FORWARD_MERGE

          o SQUASH_MERGE

          o THREE_WAY_MERGE

       --max-merge-hunks (integer)
          The maximum number of merge hunks to include in the output.

       --max-conflict-files (integer)
          The maximum number of files to include in the output.

       --file-paths (list)
          The path of the target files used to describe the conflicts. If  not
          specified, the default is all conflict files.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --conflict-detail-level (string)
          The  level  of  conflict  detail to use. If unspecified, the default
          FILE_LEVEL is used, which returns a not-mergeable result if the same
          file has differences in both branches. If LINE_LEVEL is specified, a
          conflict is considered not  mergeable  if  the  same  file  in  both
          branches has differences on the same line.

          Possible values:

          o FILE_LEVEL

          o LINE_LEVEL

       --conflict-resolution-strategy (string)
          Specifies  which  branch to use when resolving conflicts, or whether
          to attempt automatically merging two versions of a file. The default
          is NONE, which requires any conflicts to be resolved manually before
          the merge operation is successful.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ACCEPT_SOURCE

          o ACCEPT_DESTINATION

          o AUTOMERGE

       --next-token (string)
          An enumeration token that, when provided in a request,  returns  the
          next batch of the results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To  get  information  about merge conflicts in all files or a subset of
       files in a merge between two commit specifiers

       The following  batch-describe-merge-conflicts  example  determines  the
       merge  conflicts  for  merging a source branch named feature-randomiza-
       tionfeature  with  a  destination   branch   named   main   using   the
       THREE_WAY_MERGE strategy in a repository named MyDemoRepo.

              --merge-option THREE_WAY_MERGE \
