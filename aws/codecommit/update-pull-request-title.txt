UPDATE-PULL-REQUEST-TITLE()                        UPDATE-PULL-REQUEST-TITLE()



NAME
       update-pull-request-title -

DESCRIPTION
       Replaces the title of a pull request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-pull-request-title
          --pull-request-id <value>
          --title <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pull-request-id (string)
          The  system-generated  ID  of  the pull request. To get this ID, use
          ListPullRequests .

       --title (string)
          The updated title of the pull request. This  replaces  the  existing
          title.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       This  example  demonstrates  how  to change the title of a pull request
       with the ID of 47.

              --pull-request-id 47 \
              --title "Consolidation of global variables - updated review"
