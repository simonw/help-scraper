CREATE-CONTROL-PANEL()                                  CREATE-CONTROL-PANEL()



NAME
       create-control-panel -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  control  panel.  A control panel represents a group of
       routing controls that can be changed together in a single  transaction.
       You can use a control panel to centrally view the operational status of
       applications across your organization, and trigger multi-app  failovers
       in a single transaction, for example, to fail over an Availability Zone
       or Amazon Web Services Region.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-control-panel
          [--client-token <value>]
          --cluster-arn <value>
          --control-panel-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique, case-sensitive string of up to  64  ASCII  characters.  To
          make  an idempotent API request with an action, specify a client to-
          ken in the request.

       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster for the control panel.

       --control-panel-name (string)
          The name of the control panel.

       --tags (map)
          The tags associated with the control panel.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ControlPanel -> (structure)
          Information about a control panel.

          ClusterArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster that includes  the
              control panel.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          DefaultControlPanel -> (boolean)
              A flag that Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller sets
              to true to designate the default control panel  for  a  cluster.
              When  you create a cluster, Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
              Controller creates a control panel, and sets this flag for  that
              control panel. If you create a control panel yourself, this flag
              is set to false.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the control panel. You can use any  non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RoutingControlCount -> (integer)
              The number of routing controls in the control panel.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of control panel. Status can be one of the
              following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.
