NAME
       describe-safety-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a safety rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-safety-rule
          --safety-rule-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --safety-rule-arn (string)
          The ARN of the safety rule.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AssertionRule -> (structure)
          The assertion rule in the response.

          AssertedControls -> (list)
              The routing controls that are  part  of  transactions  that  are
              evaluated  to determine if a request to change a routing control
              state is allowed. For example, you might include  three  routing
              controls, one for each of three Amazon Web Services Regions.

              (string)

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          Name -> (string)
              Name  of  the  assertion  rule.  You can use any non-white space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The criteria that you set for specific  assertion  routing  con-
              trols (AssertedControls) that designate how many routing control
              states must be ON as the result of a transaction.  For  example,
              if  you have three assertion routing controls, you might specify
              atleast 2 for your rule configuration. This means that at  least
              two  assertion  routing  control  states  must be ON, so that at
              least two Amazon Web Services Regions have  traffic  flowing  to
              them.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the assertion rule.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of an assertion rule. Status can be one of
              the following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest against the target routing controls will fail. This  helps
              prevent  "flapping"  of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by de-
              fault, but you can choose a custom value.

       GatingRule -> (structure)
          The gating rule in the response.

          ControlPanelArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the control panel.

          GatingControls -> (list)
              An array of gating routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
              For  a  simple  "on/off" switch, specify the ARN for one routing
              control. The gating routing controls are evaluated by  the  rule
              configuration  that you specify to determine if the target rout-
              ing control states can be changed.

              (string)

          Name -> (string)
              The name for the gating rule. You can use  any  non-white  space
              character in the name.

          RuleConfig -> (structure)
              The  criteria that you set for gating routing controls that des-
              ignates how many of the routing control states must be ON to al-
              low you to update target routing control states.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Logical negation of the rule. If the rule would usually eval-
                 uate true, it's evaluated as false, and vice versa.

              Threshold -> (integer)
                 The value of N, when you specify an ATLEAST rule  type.  That
                 is, Threshold is the number of controls that must be set when
                 you specify an ATLEAST type.

              Type -> (string)
                 A rule can be one of the following: ATLEAST, AND, or OR.

          SafetyRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gating rule.

          Status -> (string)
              The deployment status of a gating rule. Status can be one of the
              following: PENDING, DEPLOYED, PENDING_DELETION.

          TargetControls -> (list)
              An  array of target routing control Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)
              for which the states can only be updated if the rule  configura-
              tion  that  you specify evaluates to true for the gating routing
              control. As a simple example, if you have a single  gating  con-
              trol,  it acts as an overall "on/off" switch for a set of target
              routing controls. You can use this to  manually  override  auto-
              mated fail over, for example.

              (string)

          WaitPeriodMs -> (integer)
              An evaluation period, in milliseconds (ms), during which any re-
              quest against the target routing controls will fail. This  helps
              prevent  "flapping"  of state. The wait period is 5000 ms by de-
              fault, but you can choose a custom value.
