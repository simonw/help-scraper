ASSUME-ROLE-WITH-SAML()                                ASSUME-ROLE-WITH-SAML()



NAME
       assume-role-with-saml -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a set of temporary security credentials for users who have been
       authenticated via a SAML authentication response. This  operation  pro-
       vides  a  mechanism for tying an enterprise identity store or directory
       to role-based Amazon Web Services access without user-specific  creden-
       tials or configuration. For a comparison of AssumeRoleWithSAML with the
       other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting
       Temporary  Security  Credentials  and Comparing the Amazon Web Services
       STS API operations in the IAM User Guide .

       The temporary security credentials returned by this  operation  consist
       of  an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Appli-
       cations can use these temporary security credentials to sign  calls  to
       Amazon Web Services services.
          Session Duration

       By  default,  the temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole-
       WithSAML last for one hour. However, you can  use  the  optional  Dura-
       tionSeconds  parameter  to  specify  the duration of your session. Your
       role session lasts for the duration that you specify, or until the time
       specified  in  the  SAML  authentication response's SessionNotOnOrAfter
       value, whichever is shorter. You can provide  a  DurationSeconds  value
       from  900  seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration set-
       ting for the role. This setting can have a value  from  1  hour  to  12
       hours.  To  learn how to view the maximum value for your role, see View
       the Maximum Session Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide .
       The maximum session duration limit applies when you use the AssumeRole*
       API operations or the assume-role* CLI commands. However the limit does
       not  apply  when  you use those operations to create a console URL. For
       more information, see Using IAM Roles in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
              Role chaining limits your CLI or Amazon Web  Services  API  role
              session  to  a  maximum of one hour. When you use the AssumeRole
              API operation to assume a role, you can specify the duration  of
              your  role  session  with the DurationSeconds parameter. You can
              specify a parameter value of up to 43200 seconds (12 hours), de-
              pending  on  the maximum session duration setting for your role.
              However, if you assume a role using role chaining and provide  a
              DurationSeconds parameter value greater than one hour, the oper-
              ation fails.

          Permissions

       The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRoleWithSAML can be
       used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the fol-
       lowing exception: you cannot call the STS GetFederationToken or GetSes-
       sionToken API operations.

       (Optional)  You can pass inline or managed session policies to this op-
       eration. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline
       session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Re-
       source Names (ARNs) to use as managed session policies.  The  plaintext
       that  you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed
       2,048 characters. Passing policies to this operation returns new tempo-
       rary credentials. The resulting session's permissions are the intersec-
       tion of the role's identity-based policy and the session policies.  You
       can  use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web Ser-
       vices API calls to access resources in the account that owns the  role.
       You  cannot  use  session policies to grant more permissions than those
       allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed.
       For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM User Guide .

       Calling  AssumeRoleWithSAML does not require the use of Amazon Web Ser-
       vices security credentials. The identity of the caller is validated  by
       using  keys  in  the  metadata  document  that is uploaded for the SAML
       provider entity for your identity provider.

       WARNING:
              Calling AssumeRoleWithSAML can result in an entry in your Cloud-
              Trail  logs.  The entry includes the value in the NameID element
              of the SAML assertion. We recommend that you  use  a  NameIDType
              that is not associated with any personally identifiable informa-
              tion (PII). For example, you could instead  use  the  persistent
              identifier (urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent
              ).

          Tags

       (Optional) You can configure your IdP to pass attributes into your SAML
       assertion  as session tags. Each session tag consists of a key name and
       an associated value. For  more  information  about  session  tags,  see
       Passing Session Tags in STS in the IAM User Guide .

       You can pass up to 50 session tags. The plaintext session tag keys cant
       exceed 128 characters and the values cant exceed  256  characters.  For
       these  and  additional  limits, see IAM and STS Character Limits in the
       IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
          An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline  ses-
          sion policy, managed policy ARNs, and session tags into a packed bi-
          nary format that has a separate limit. Your  request  can  fail  for
          this  limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. The
          PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how  close
          the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit.

       You  can pass a session tag with the same key as a tag that is attached
       to the role. When you do, session tags override the  role's  tags  with
       the same key.

       An  administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass ses-
       sion tags. The administrator can also create  granular  permissions  to
       allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see
       Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control in the IAM User
       Guide .

       You  can  set  the  session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist
       during role chaining. For more information,  see  Chaining  Roles  with
       Session Tags in the IAM User Guide .
          SAML Configuration

       Before  your application can call AssumeRoleWithSAML , you must config-
       ure your SAML identity provider (IdP) to issue the claims  required  by
       Amazon  Web  Services.  Additionally,  you must use Identity and Access
       Management (IAM) to create a SAML provider entity in  your  Amazon  Web
       Services  account that represents your identity provider. You must also
       create an IAM role that specifies this SAML provider in its trust  pol-
       icy.

OPTIONS
       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that the caller is assum-
          ing.

       --principal-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SAML provider in IAM that  de-
          scribes the IdP.

       --saml-assertion (string)
          The base64 encoded SAML authentication response provided by the IdP.

          For  more  information,  see  Configuring a Relying Party and Adding
          Claims in the IAM User Guide .

       --policy-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the IAM  managed  policies  that
          you want to use as managed session policies. The policies must exist
          in the same account as the role.

          This parameter is optional. You can provide up to 10 managed  policy
          ARNs.  However,  the plaintext that you use for both inline and man-
          aged session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. For more infor-
          mation  about  ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and Amazon Web
          Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services General  Ref-
          erence.

          NOTE:
              An  Amazon  Web Services conversion compresses the passed inline
              session policy, managed policy ARNs, and  session  tags  into  a
              packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can
              fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the  other  re-
              quirements.  The  PackedPolicySize response element indicates by
              percentage how close the policies and tags for your request  are
              to the upper size limit.

          Passing  policies  to  this  operation returns new temporary creden-
          tials. The resulting session's permissions are the  intersection  of
          the  role's  identity-based policy and the session policies. You can
          use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  API  calls  to  access resources in the account that owns the
          role. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than
          those allowed by the identity-based policy of the role that is being
          assumed. For more information, see Session Policies in the IAM  User
          Guide .

          (structure)
              A  reference  to the IAM managed policy that is passed as a ses-
              sion policy for a role session or a federated user session.

              arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM managed  policy  to
                 use  as  a  session policy for the role. For more information
                 about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) and  Amazon  Web
                 Services  Service  Namespaces in the Amazon Web Services Gen-
                 eral Reference .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          arn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "arn": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --policy (string)
          An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline  ses-
          sion policy.

          This  parameter  is optional. Passing policies to this operation re-
          turns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions
          are  the  intersection  of  the role's identity-based policy and the
          session policies. You can use the role's  temporary  credentials  in
          subsequent  Amazon Web Services API calls to access resources in the
          account that owns the role. You cannot use session policies to grant
          more  permissions than those allowed by the identity-based policy of
          the role that is being assumed. For more  information,  see  Session
          Policies in the IAM User Guide .

          The plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session poli-
          cies can't exceed 2,048 characters. The JSON policy  characters  can
          be  any  ASCII  character from the space character to the end of the
          valid character list (u0020 through u00FF). It can also include  the
          tab  (u0009),  linefeed (u000A), and carriage return (u000D) charac-
          ters.

          NOTE:
              An Amazon Web Services conversion compresses the  passed  inline
              session  policy,  managed  policy  ARNs, and session tags into a
              packed binary format that has a separate limit. Your request can
              fail  for  this limit even if your plaintext meets the other re-
              quirements. The PackedPolicySize response element  indicates  by
              percentage  how close the policies and tags for your request are
              to the upper size limit.

       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The duration, in seconds, of the role  session.  Your  role  session
          lasts  for the duration that you specify for the DurationSeconds pa-
          rameter, or until the time specified in the SAML authentication  re-
          sponse's  SessionNotOnOrAfter  value,  whichever is shorter. You can
          provide a DurationSeconds value from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up  to
          the  maximum session duration setting for the role. This setting can
          have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. If you specify a value  higher
          than  this setting, the operation fails. For example, if you specify
          a session duration of 12 hours, but your administrator set the maxi-
          mum  session duration to 6 hours, your operation fails. To learn how
          to view the maximum value for your role, see View the  Maximum  Ses-
          sion Duration Setting for a Role in the IAM User Guide .

          By default, the value is set to 3600 seconds.

          NOTE:
              The DurationSeconds parameter is separate from the duration of a
              console session that you might request using the  returned  cre-
              dentials.  The  request to the federation endpoint for a console
              sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter  that  specifies
              the maximum length of the console session. For more information,
              see Creating a URL that Enables Federated Users  to  Access  the
              Amazon Web Services Management Console in the IAM User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get short-term credentials for a role authenticated with SAML

       The   following   assume-role-with-saml  command  retrieves  a  set  of
       short-term credentials for the  IAM role TestSaml. The request in  this
       example  is  authenticated by using the SAML assertion supplied by your
       identity provider when you authenticate to it.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The  temporary security credentials, which include an access key ID,
          a secret access key, and a security (or session) token.

          NOTE:
              The size of the security token that STS API operations return is
              not  fixed.  We  strongly recommend that you make no assumptions
              about the maximum size.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The  token  that  users  must pass to the service API to use the
              temporary credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the current credentials expire.

       AssumedRoleUser -> (structure)
          The identifiers for the temporary security credentials that the  op-
          eration returns.

          AssumedRoleId -> (string)
              A  unique identifier that contains the role ID and the role ses-
              sion name of the role that is being assumed. The role ID is gen-
              erated by Amazon Web Services when the role is created.

          Arn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the temporary security credentials that are returned
              from the  AssumeRole action. For more information about ARNs and
              how to use them in policies, see IAM Identifiers in the IAM User
              Guide .

       PackedPolicySize -> (integer)
          A percentage value that indicates the packed  size  of  the  session
          policies  and  session  tags combined passed in the request. The re-
          quest fails if the packed size is greater than  100  percent,  which
          means the policies and tags exceeded the allowed space.

       Subject -> (string)
          The  value  of the NameID element in the Subject element of the SAML
          assertion.

       SubjectType -> (string)
          The format of the name ID, as defined by the Format attribute in the
          NameID element of the SAML assertion. Typical examples of the format
          are transient or persistent .

          If     the     format     includes      the      prefix      urn:oa-
          sis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format  ,  that  prefix is removed. For
          example, urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient is  re-
          turned  as  transient . If the format includes any other prefix, the
          format is returned with no modifications.

       Issuer -> (string)
          The value of the Issuer element of the SAML assertion.

       Audience -> (string)
          The value of the Recipient attribute of the  SubjectConfirmationData
          element of the SAML assertion.

       NameQualifier -> (string)
          A hash value based on the concatenation of the following:

          o The Issuer response value.

          o The Amazon Web Services account ID.

          o The  friendly name (the last part of the ARN) of the SAML provider
            in IAM.

          The combination of NameQualifier and Subject can be used to uniquely
          identify a user.

          The following pseudocode shows how the hash value is calculated:
              BASE64  (  SHA1  ( "https://example.com/saml" + "123456789012" +
              "/MySAMLIdP" ) )

       SourceIdentity -> (string)
          The value in the SourceIdentity attribute in the SAML assertion.

          You can require users to set a source identity value when  they  as-
          sume  a  role. You do this by using the sts:SourceIdentity condition
          key in a role trust policy. That way, actions that  are  taken  with
          the role are associated with that user. After the source identity is
          set, the value cannot be changed. It is present in the  request  for
          all  actions  that are taken by the role and persists across chained
          role sessions. You can configure your SAML identity provider to  use
          an attribute associated with your users, like user name or email, as
          the source identity when calling AssumeRoleWithSAML . You do this by
          adding  an  attribute  to  the  SAML assertion. For more information
          about using source identity, see Monitor and control  actions  taken
          with assumed roles in the IAM User Guide .

          The  regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
          consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with  no
          spaces.  You  can  also  include underscores or any of the following
          characters: =,.@-
