GET-SESSION-TOKEN()                                        GET-SESSION-TOKEN()



NAME
       get-session-token -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  set of temporary credentials for an Amazon Web Services ac-
       count or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID,  a  se-
       cret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use GetSessionTo-
       ken if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic  calls  to  specific
       Amazon  Web  Services  API  operations  like Amazon EC2 StopInstances .
       MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call GetSessionToken and submit  an
       MFA  code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary
       security credentials that are returned from the  call,  IAM  users  can
       then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authen-
       tication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns
       an  access  denied  error. For a comparison of GetSessionToken with the
       other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see Requesting
       Temporary  Security  Credentials  and Comparing the Amazon Web Services
       STS API operations in the IAM User Guide .

       NOTE:
              No permissions are required for users to perform this operation.
              The purpose of the sts:GetSessionToken operation is to authenti-
              cate the user using MFA. You cannot use policies to control  au-
              thentication  operations.  For more information, see Permissions
              for GetSessionToken in the IAM User Guide .

          Session Duration

       The GetSessionToken operation must be called  by  using  the  long-term
       Amazon Web Services security credentials of the Amazon Web Services ac-
       count root user or an IAM user. Credentials that  are  created  by  IAM
       users  are  valid  for the duration that you specify. This duration can
       range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600  seconds
       (36  hours),  with  a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials
       based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up
       to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour.
          Permissions

       The  temporary  security  credentials created by GetSessionToken can be
       used to make API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the fol-
       lowing exceptions:

       o You  cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication in-
         formation is included in the request.

       o You cannot call any STS API except  AssumeRole or GetCallerIdentity .

       NOTE:
          We recommend that you do not call GetSessionToken  with  Amazon  Web
          Services  account  root  user  credentials. Instead, follow our best
          practices by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the  neces-
          sary  permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with
          Amazon Web Services.

       The credentials that are returned by GetSessionToken are based on  per-
       missions  associated  with the user whose credentials were used to call
       the operation. If GetSessionToken is called using Amazon  Web  Services
       account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user
       permissions. Similarly, if GetSessionToken is called using the  creden-
       tials  of  an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permis-
       sions as the IAM user.

       For more information about using GetSessionToken  to  create  temporary
       credentials,  go  to Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Envi-
       ronments in the IAM User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-session-token
          [--duration-seconds <value>]
          [--serial-number <value>]
          [--token-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --duration-seconds (integer)
          The duration, in seconds, that the credentials should remain  valid.
          Acceptable  durations  for  IAM user sessions range from 900 seconds
          (15 minutes) to 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with 43,200 seconds  (12
          hours) as the default. Sessions for Amazon Web Services account own-
          ers are restricted to a maximum of 3,600 seconds (one hour). If  the
          duration  is  longer  than one hour, the session for Amazon Web Ser-
          vices account owners defaults to one hour.

       --serial-number (string)
          The identification number of the MFA device that is associated  with
          the  IAM  user  who is making the GetSessionToken call. Specify this
          value if the IAM user has a policy that requires MFA authentication.
          The value is either the serial number for a hardware device (such as
          GAHT12345678 ) or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a virtual device
          (such  as arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/user ). You can find the de-
          vice for an IAM user by going to the Amazon Web Services  Management
          Console and viewing the user's security credentials.

          The  regex used to validate this parameter is a string of characters
          consisting of upper- and lower-case alphanumeric characters with  no
          spaces.  You  can  also  include underscores or any of the following
          characters: =,.@:/-

       --token-code (string)
          The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA  is  required.  If  any
          policy  requires  the  IAM  user to submit an MFA code, specify this
          value. If MFA authentication is required, the user  must  provide  a
          code when requesting a set of temporary security credentials. A user
          who fails to provide the code receives an "access  denied"  response
          when requesting resources that require MFA authentication.

          The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is
          a sequence of six numeric digits.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get a set of short term credentials for an IAM identity

       The following get-session-token example retrieves a set  of  short-term
       credentials for the IAM identity making the call. The resulting creden-
       tials can be used for requests where multi-factor authentication  (MFA)
       is required by policy. The credentials expire 15 minutes after they are
       generated.

          aws sts get-session-token \
              --duration-seconds 900 \
              --serial-number "YourMFADeviceSerialNumber" \
              --token-code 123456

       Output:

          {
              "Credentials": {
                  "AccessKeyId": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
                  "SecretAccessKey": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYzEXAMPLEKEY",
                  "SessionToken": "AQoEXAMPLEH4aoAH0gNCAPyJxz4BlCFFxWNE1OPTgk5TthT+FvwqnKwRcOIfrRh3c/LTo6UDdyJwOOvEVPvLXCrrrUtdnniCEXAMPLE/IvU1dYUg2RVAJBanLiHb4IgRmpRV3zrkuWJOgQs8IZZaIv2BXIa2R4OlgkBN9bkUDNCJiBeb/AXlzBBko7b15fjrBs2+cTQtpZ3CYWFXG8C5zqx37wnOE49mRl/+OtkIKGO7fAE",
                  "Expiration": "2020-05-19T18:06:10+00:00"
              }
          }

       the IAM User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Credentials -> (structure)
          The  temporary security credentials, which include an access key ID,
          a secret access key, and a security (or session) token.

          NOTE:
              The size of the security token that STS API operations return is
              not  fixed.  We  strongly recommend that you make no assumptions
              about the maximum size.

          AccessKeyId -> (string)
              The access key ID that identifies the temporary security creden-
              tials.

          SecretAccessKey -> (string)
              The secret access key that can be used to sign requests.

          SessionToken -> (string)
              The  token  that  users  must pass to the service API to use the
              temporary credentials.

          Expiration -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the current credentials expire.
