LIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES-BY-POLILIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES-BY-POLICY()



NAME
       list-traffic-policy-instances-by-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created by
       using a specify traffic policy version.

       NOTE:
          After you submit a  CreateTrafficPolicyInstance  or  an  UpdateTraf-
          ficPolicyInstance  request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route
          53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the  traf-
          fic  policy definition. For more information, see the State response
          element.

       Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a
       lot  of traffic policy instances, you can use the MaxItems parameter to
       list them in groups of up to 100.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy for which you want to list traffic pol-
          icy instances.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version of the traffic policy for which you want to list traffic
          policy instances. The version must be associated  with  the  traffic
          policy that is specified by TrafficPolicyId .

       --hosted-zone-id-marker (string)
          If  the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true , you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances, submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy request.

          For  the  value of hostedzoneid , specify the value of HostedZoneId-
          Marker from the previous response, which is the hosted  zone  ID  of
          the  first  traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53 will return
          if you submit another request.

          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous  response  was  false  ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --traffic-policy-instance-name-marker (string)
          If  the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true , you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances, submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy request.

          For  the  value  of trafficpolicyinstancename , specify the value of
          TrafficPolicyInstanceNameMarker from the previous response, which is
          the  name  of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53
          will return if you submit another request.

          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous  response  was  false  ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --traffic-policy-instance-type-marker (string)
          If  the value of IsTruncated in the previous response was true , you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances, submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstancesByPolicy request.

          For  the  value  of trafficpolicyinstancetype , specify the value of
          TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker from the previous response, which is
          the  name  of the first traffic policy instance that Amazon Route 53
          will return if you submit another request.

          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous  response  was  false  ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

          Possible values:

          o SOA

          o A

          o TXT

          o NS

          o CNAME

          o CAA

          o DS

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the
          response body for this request. If you have more than MaxItems traf-
          fic  policy  instances,  the value of the IsTruncated element in the
          response is true , and the  values  of  HostedZoneIdMarker  ,  Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceNameMarker  ,  and  TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker
          represent the first traffic policy instance  that  Amazon  Route  53
          will return if you submit another request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
