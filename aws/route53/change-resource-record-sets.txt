CHANGE-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()                    CHANGE-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()



NAME
       change-resource-record-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates,  changes, or deletes a resource record set, which contains au-
       thoritative DNS information for a specified domain  name  or  subdomain
       name. For example, you can use ChangeResourceRecordSets to create a re-
       source record set that routes traffic for  test.example.com  to  a  web
       server that has an IP address of 192.0.2.44.
          Deleting Resource Record Sets

       To  delete  a resource record set, you must specify all the same values
       that you specified when you created it.
          Change Batches and Transactional Changes

       The request body must include a document with  a  ChangeResourceRecord-
       SetsRequest  element. The request body contains a list of change items,
       known as a change batch. Change batches  are  considered  transactional
       changes.  Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either
       makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This  en-
       sures  that  DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to
       the resource record sets in a hosted zone.

       For example, suppose a change batch request contains  two  changes:  it
       deletes  the  CNAME resource record set for www.example.com and creates
       an alias resource record set for  www.example.com.  If  validation  for
       both  records  succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set
       and creates the second resource record set in a  single  operation.  If
       validation  for  either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, then the
       request is canceled, and the original CNAME record continues to exist.

       NOTE:
              If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once
              in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch
              error.

          Traffic Flow

       To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations,  use
       either  the  traffic  flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the
       API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances. Save the
       configuration  as  a  traffic policy, then associate the traffic policy
       with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain  names
       (such  as  www.example.com),  in  the  same  hosted zone or in multiple
       hosted zones. You can roll back the updates if  the  new  configuration
       isn't  performing  as expected. For more information, see Using Traffic
       Flow to Route DNS Traffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Create, Delete, and Upsert

       Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:

       o CREATE : Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.

       o DELETE : Deletes an existing resource record set that has the  speci-
         fied values.

       o UPSERT : If a resource set exists Route 53 updates it with the values
         in the request.
          Syntaxes for Creating, Updating, and Deleting Resource Record Sets

       The syntax for a request depends on the type  of  resource  record  set
       that you want to create, delete, or update, such as weighted, alias, or
       failover. The XML elements in your request must  appear  in  the  order
       listed in the syntax.

       For an example for each type of resource record set, see "Examples."

       Don't  refer to the syntax in the "Parameter Syntax" section, which in-
       cludes all of the elements for every kind of resource record  set  that
       you can create, delete, or update by using ChangeResourceRecordSets .
          Change Propagation to Route 53 DNS Servers

       When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Route 53 propagates
       your changes to all of the Route 53 authoritative DNS servers  managing
       the  hosted zone. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns
       a status of PENDING . When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a
       status  of  INSYNC  .  Changes generally propagate to all Route 53 name
       servers managing the hosted zone within 60 seconds. For  more  informa-
       tion, see GetChange .
          Limits on ChangeResourceRecordSets Requests

       For information about the limits on a ChangeResourceRecordSets request,
       see Limits in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that contains  the  resource  record  sets
          that you want to change.

       --change-batch (structure)
          A complex type that contains an optional comment and the Changes el-
          ement.

          Comment -> (string)
              Optional: Any comments you want to include about a change  batch
              request.

          Changes -> (list)
              Information about the changes to make to the record sets.

              (structure)
                 The information for each resource record set that you want to
                 change.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action to perform:

                     o CREATE : Creates a resource record  set  that  has  the
                       specified values.

                     o DELETE : Deletes a existing resource record set.

                     WARNING:
                        To  delete  the resource record set that is associated
                        with    a     traffic     policy     instance,     use
                        DeleteTrafficPolicyInstance  .  Amazon  Route  53 will
                        delete the resource record set automatically.  If  you
                        delete  the  resource  record  set  by using ChangeRe-
                        sourceRecordSets  ,  Route  53  doesn't  automatically
                        delete  the  traffic  policy instance, and you'll con-
                        tinue to be charged for it even though it's no  longer
                        in use.

                     o UPSERT  :  If a resource record set doesn't already ex-
                       ist, Route 53 creates it. If a resource record set does
                       exist,  Route  53 updates it with the values in the re-
                       quest.

                 ResourceRecordSet -> (structure)
                     Information about the  resource  record  set  to  create,
                     delete, or update.

                     Name -> (string)
                        For ChangeResourceRecordSets requests, the name of the
                        record that you want to create, update, or delete. For
                        ListResourceRecordSets responses, the name of a record
                        in the specified hosted zone.
                            ChangeResourceRecordSets Only

                        Enter a fully  qualified  domain  name,  for  example,
                        www.example.com  . You can optionally include a trail-
                        ing dot. If you omit the trailing dot, Amazon Route 53
                        assumes that the domain name that you specify is fully
                        qualified. This means that Route 53  treats  www.exam-
                        ple.com  (without a trailing dot) and www.example.com.
                        (with a trailing dot) as identical.

                        For information about how to specify characters  other
                        than a-z , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify in-
                        ternationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name For-
                        mat in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                        You  can  use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the
                        leftmost label in a domain name, for example,  *.exam-
                        ple.com . Note the following:

                        o The  *  must  replace the entire label. For example,
                          you can't specify *prod.example.com  or  prod*.exam-
                          ple.com .

                        o The  *  can't  replace any of the middle labels, for
                          example, marketing.*.example.com.

                        o If you include * in  any  position  other  than  the
                          leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an
                          * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

                        WARNING:
                            You can't use the * wildcard for resource  records
                            sets that have a type of NS.

                        You  can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a
                        domain name, for example, *.example.com  .  You  can't
                        use  an  *  for one of the middle labels, for example,
                        marketing.*.example.com . In addition, the * must  re-
                        place the entire label; for example, you can't specify
                        prod*.example.com .

                     Type -> (string)
                        The DNS record type. For information  about  different

                               NOTE:
                            SPF records were formerly used to verify the iden-
                            tity of the sender of email messages. However,  we
                            no  longer  recommend  that  you  create  resource
                            record sets for which the value of Type is  SPF  .
                            RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Autho-
                            rizing Use of Domains in Email, Version  1  ,  has
                            been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mech-
                            anism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some inter-
                            operability  issues.  Accordingly,  its  use is no
                            longer appropriate for SPF version 1;  implementa-
                            tions are not to use it." In RFC 7208, see section
                            14.1, The SPF DNS Record Type .

                        Values for alias resource record sets:

                        o Amazon API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-op-
                          timized APIs:  A

                        o CloudFront  distributions:   A    If IPv6 is enabled
                          for the distribution,  create  two  resource  record
                          sets to route traffic to your distribution, one with
                          a value of A and one with a value of AAAA .

                        o Amazon API Gateway environment that has a  regional-
                          ized subdomain : A

                        o ELB load balancers:  A | AAAA

                        o Amazon S3 buckets:  A

                        o Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints
                          A

                        o Another resource record set  in  this  hosted  zone:
                          Specify  the  type  of  the resource record set that
                          you're creating the alias for. All values  are  sup-
                          ported except NS and SOA .

                        NOTE:
                            If  you're  creating  an alias record that has the
                            same name as the hosted zone (known  as  the  zone
                            apex),  you  can't  route  traffic to a record for
                            which the value of Type is CNAME . This is because
                            the  alias  record  must have the same type as the
                            record you're routing traffic to, and  creating  a
                            CNAME  record  for  the  zone apex isn't supported
                            even for an alias record.

                     SetIdentifier -> (string)
                            Resource record sets that have  a  routing  policy
                            other  than simple: An identifier that differenti-
                            ates among multiple resource record sets that have
                            the  same  combination  of  name and type, such as
                            multiple  weighted  resource  record  sets   named
                            acme.example.com that have a type of A. In a group
                            of resource record sets that have  the  same  name
                            and  type,  the  value  of  SetIdentifier  must be
                            unique for each resource record set.

                        For information about routing policies, see Choosing a
                        Routing  Policy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
                        .

                     Weight -> (long)
                            Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource
                            record  sets that have the same combination of DNS
                            name and type, a value that determines the propor-
                            tion  of DNS queries that Amazon Route 53 responds
                            to using the current resource record set. Route 53
                            calculates the sum of the weights for the resource
                            record sets that have the same combination of  DNS
                            name  and  type. Route 53 then responds to queries
                            based on the ratio of a resource's weight  to  the
                            total. Note the following:

                        o You  must specify a value for the Weight element for
                          every weighted resource record set.

                        o You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted
                          resource record set.

                        o You  can't  create latency, failover, or geolocation
                          resource record sets that have the same  values  for
                          the  Name  and  Type  elements  as weighted resource
                          record sets.

                        o You can create a maximum of  100  weighted  resource
                          record  sets  that have the same values for the Name
                          and Type elements.

                        o For  weighted  (but  not  weighted  alias)  resource
                          record  sets,  if you set Weight to 0 for a resource
                          record set, Route 53 never responds to queries  with
                          the  applicable  value for that resource record set.
                          However, if you set Weight to  0  for  all  resource
                          record  sets  that  have the same combination of DNS
                          name and type, traffic is routed  to  all  resources
                          with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight
                          to 0 is different when you associate  health  checks
                          with  weighted resource record sets. For more infor-

                     Region -> (string)
                            Latency-based resource record sets only: The  Ama-
                            zon EC2 Region where you created the resource that
                            this resource record set refers to.  The  resource
                            typically is an Amazon Web Services resource, such
                            as an EC2 instance or an ELB load balancer, and is
                            referred to by an IP address or a DNS domain name,
                            depending on the record type.

                        When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain
                        name  and  type for which you have created latency re-
                        source record sets, Route 53 selects the  latency  re-
                        source  record set that has the lowest latency between
                        the end user and the  associated  Amazon  EC2  Region.
                        Route  53  then  returns  the value that is associated
                        with the selected resource record set.

                        Note the following:

                        o You can only specify one ResourceRecord per  latency
                          resource record set.

                        o You  can only create one latency resource record set
                          for each Amazon EC2 Region.

                        o You  aren't  required  to  create  latency  resource
                          record  sets  for  all  Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53
                          will choose the region with the  best  latency  from
                          among  the  regions that you create latency resource
                          record sets for.

                        o You can't create non-latency  resource  record  sets
                          that have the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                          ments as latency resource record sets.

                     GeoLocation -> (structure)
                            Geolocation resource record sets only:  A  complex
                            type that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 re-
                            sponds to DNS queries based on the geographic ori-
                            gin  of  the  query.  For example, if you want all
                            queries from Africa to be routed to a  web  server
                            with  an  IP address of 192.0.2.111 , create a re-
                            source record set with a Type of A  and  a  Conti-
                            nentCode of AF .

                        NOTE:
                            Although   creating  geolocation  and  geolocation
                            alias resource record sets  in  a  private  hosted
                            zone is allowed, it's not supported.

                        If  you create separate resource record sets for over-
                        lapping geographic regions (for example, one  resource
                        record  set  for  a continent and one for a country on
                        the same continent), priority goes to the smallest ge-
                        ographic region. This allows you to route most queries
                        for a continent to one resource and to  route  queries
                        for  a  country  on  that continent to a different re-
                        source.

                        You can't create two geolocation resource record  sets
                        that specify the same geographic location.

                        The value * in the CountryCode element matches all ge-
                        ographic locations that aren't specified in other  ge-
                        olocation resource record sets that have the same val-
                        ues for the Name and Type elements.

                        WARNING:
                            Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to loca-
                            tions. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to
                            geographic locations, so even if you create geolo-
                            cation  resource  record sets that cover all seven
                            continents, Route 53 will receive some DNS queries
                            from  locations  that it can't identify. We recom-
                            mend that you create a  resource  record  set  for
                            which  the  value of CountryCode is * . Two groups
                            of queries are routed to  the  resource  that  you
                            specify in this record: queries that come from lo-
                            cations for which you haven't created  geolocation
                            resource record sets and queries from IP addresses
                            that aren't mapped to a  location.  If  you  don't
                            create a * resource record set, Route 53 returns a
                            "no answer" response for queries from those  loca-
                            tions.

                        You  can't create non-geolocation resource record sets
                        that have the same values for the Name and  Type  ele-
                        ments as geolocation resource record sets.

                        ContinentCode -> (string)
                            The two-letter code for the continent.

                            Amazon  Route  53 supports the following continent
                            codes:

                            o AF : Africa

                            o AN : Antarctica

                            o AS : Asia

                            o EU : Europe

                            o OC : Oceania

                            o NA : North America

                            o SA : South America

                            Constraint: Specifying ContinentCode  with  either
                            CountryCode or SubdivisionCode returns an Invalid-
                            Input error.

                        CountryCode -> (string)
                            For geolocation resource record sets, the two-let-
                            ter code for a country.

                            Amazon  Route 53 uses the two-letter country codes
                            that are specified in ISO standard 3166-1  alpha-2
                            .

                        SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                            For geolocation resource record sets, the two-let-
                            ter code for a state of the United  States.  Route
                            53  doesn't  support any other values for Subdivi-
                            sionCode . For a list of state abbreviations,  see
                            Appendix  B: TwoLetter State and Possession Abbre-
                            viations on the United States Postal Service  web-
                            site.

                            If  you  specify  subdivisioncode  , you must also
                            specify US for CountryCode .

                     Failover -> (string)
                            Failover resource record sets only:  To  configure
                            failover,  you add the Failover element to two re-
                            source record sets. For one resource  record  set,
                            you  specify  PRIMARY  as the value for Failover ;
                            for the other resource  record  set,  you  specify
                            SECONDARY   .   In   addition,   you  include  the
                            HealthCheckId element and specify the health check
                            that  you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for each
                            resource record set.

                        Except where noted, the following  failover  behaviors
                        assume  that  you have included the HealthCheckId ele-
                        ment in both resource record sets:

                        o When the primary resource  record  set  is  healthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value from the primary resource record  set  regard-
                          less  of the health of the secondary resource record
                          set.

                        o When the primary resource record  set  is  unhealthy
                          and  the  secondary  resource record set is healthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value from the secondary resource record set.

                        o When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy,
                          Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable
                          value  from  the primary resource record set regard-
                          less of the health of the  primary  resource  record
                          set.

                        o If  you  omit the HealthCheckId element for the sec-
                          ondary resource record set, and if the  primary  re-
                          source  record set is unhealthy, Route 53 always re-
                          sponds to DNS queries with the applicable value from
                          the  secondary resource record set. This is true re-
                          gardless of the health of the associated endpoint.

                        You can't create  non-failover  resource  record  sets
                        that  have  the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                        ments as failover resource record sets.

                        For failover alias resource record sets, you must also
                        include  the  EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the
                        value to true.

                        Route 53, see the following topics in the Amazon Route

                     MultiValueAnswer -> (boolean)
                            Multivalue answer resource record sets only  :  To
                            route  traffic  approximately randomly to multiple
                            resources, such as web servers, create one  multi-
                            value  answer record for each resource and specify
                            true for MultiValueAnswer . Note the following:

                        o If you associate a health check  with  a  multivalue
                          answer resource record set, Amazon Route 53 responds
                          to DNS queries with  the  corresponding  IP  address
                          only when the health check is healthy.

                        o If  you don't associate a health check with a multi-
                          value answer record, Route 53 always  considers  the
                          record to be healthy.

                        o Route  53  responds  to DNS queries with up to eight
                          healthy records; if you have eight or fewer  healthy
                          records,  Route  53 responds to all DNS queries with
                          all the healthy records.

                        o If you have more than eight healthy  records,  Route
                          53  responds to different DNS resolvers with differ-
                          ent combinations of healthy records.

                        o When all records are unhealthy, Route 53 responds to
                          DNS queries with up to eight unhealthy records.

                        o If  a  resource becomes unavailable after a resolver
                          caches a response, client software  typically  tries
                          another of the IP addresses in the response.

                        You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

                     TTL -> (long)
                        The  resource record cache time to live (TTL), in sec-
                        onds. Note the following:

                        o If you're creating or  updating  an  alias  resource
                          record  set,  omit  TTL  .  Amazon Route 53 uses the
                          value of TTL for the alias target.

                        o If you're associating this resource record set  with
                          a health check (if you're adding a HealthCheckId el-
                          ement), we recommend that you specify a  TTL  of  60
                          seconds  or  less  so  clients  respond  quickly  to
                          changes in health status.

                        o All of the  resource  record  sets  in  a  group  of
                          weighted  resource  record  sets  must have the same
                          value for TTL .

                        o If a group of weighted resource record sets includes
                          one  or more weighted alias resource record sets for
                          which the alias target is an ELB load  balancer,  we
                          recommend  that  you specify a TTL of 60 seconds for
                          all of the non-alias weighted resource  record  sets
                          that  have the same name and type. Values other than
                          60 seconds (the TTL for load balancers) will  change
                          the effect of the values that you specify for Weight
                          .

                     ResourceRecords -> (list)

                        NOTE:
                            If you're creating an alias resource  record  set,
                            omit ResourceRecords .

                        (structure)
                            Information specific to the resource record.

                            NOTE:

                               secondary  records  have the same name, and you
                               can't include the same alternate domain name in
                               more than one distribution.

                            zon Web Services Management Console, the ELB  API,
                            or the CLI.

                            o Amazon  Web  Services Management Console : Go to
                              the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navi-
                              gation  pane,  choose  the load balancer, choose
                              the Description tab, and get the  value  of  the
                              DNS  name field.  If you're routing traffic to a
                              Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins
                              with  dualstack  .  If you're routing traffic to
                              another type of load  balancer,  get  the  value
                              that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

                               Another Route 53 resource record set

                            Specify  the  value  of the Name element for a re-
                            source record set in the current hosted zone.

                            NOTE:
                               If you're creating an alias record that has the
                               same name as the hosted zone (known as the zone
                               apex), you can't specify the domain name for  a
                               record  for  which the value of Type is CNAME .
                               This is because the alias record must have  the
                               same  type  as  the  record that you're routing
                               traffic to, and creating a CNAME record for the
                               zone  apex  isn't  supported  even for an alias
                               record.

                        EvaluateTargetHealth -> (boolean)
                               Applies only to alias, failover alias, geoloca-
                               tion  alias,  latency alias, and weighted alias
                               resource record sets: When EvaluateTargetHealth
                               is true , an alias resource record set inherits
                               the health of the referenced  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                               vices resource, such as an ELB load balancer or
                               another resource record set in the hosted zone.

                            Note the following:
                               CloudFront distributions

                            You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth  to  true  when
                            the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.
                               Elastic  Beanstalk  environments  that have re-
                               gionalized subdomains

                            If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in
                            DNSName  and  the environment contains an ELB load
                            balancer, Elastic Load  Balancing  routes  queries
                            only  to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are
                            registered with the load balancer. (An environment
                            automatically  contains an ELB load balancer if it
                            includes more than one Amazon  EC2  instance.)  If
                            you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no
                            Amazon EC2 instances are healthy or the load  bal-
                            ancer itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries
                            to other available resources that are healthy,  if
                            any.

                            If  the  environment  contains a single Amazon EC2
                            instance, there are no special requirements.
                               ELB load balancers

                            Health checking behavior depends on  the  type  of
                            load balancer:

                            o Classic  Load  Balancers : If you specify an ELB
                              Classic Load Balancer in DNSName , Elastic  Load
                              Balancing  routes  queries  only  to the healthy
                              Amazon EC2 instances that  are  registered  with
                              the  load  balancer. If you set EvaluateTargetH-
                              ealth to true and either no  EC2  instances  are
                              healthy  or  the  load  balancer  itself  is un-
                              healthy, Route 53 routes queries  to  other  re-
                              sources.

                            o Application  and Network Load Balancers : If you
                              specify an ELB Application or Network Load  Bal-
                              ancer and you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true ,
                              Route 53 routes queries  to  the  load  balancer
                              based  on  the  health of the target groups that
                              are associated with the load balancer:

                              o For an Application or Network Load Balancer to
                                be considered healthy, every target group that
                                contains targets must  contain  at  least  one
                                healthy  target.  If any target group contains
                                only unhealthy targets, the load  balancer  is
                                considered  unhealthy,  and  Route  53  routes
                                queries to other resources.

                              o A target group that has no registered  targets
                                is considered unhealthy.

                            NOTE:
                               When  you create a load balancer, you configure
                               settings  for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  health
                               checks; they're not Route 53 health checks, but
                               they perform a similar function. Do not  create
                               Route  53  health  checks for the EC2 instances
                               that you register with an ELB load balancer.

                               S3 buckets

                            There are  no  special  requirements  for  setting
                            EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target
                            is an S3 bucket.
                               Other records in the same hosted zone

                            If the Amazon Web Services resource that you spec-
                            ify  in  DNSName is a record or a group of records
                            (for example, a group of weighted records) but  is
                            not  another  alias  record, we recommend that you
                            associate a health check with all of  the  records
                            in  the  alias  target.  For more information, see
                            What Happens When You Omit Health Checks?  in  the
                            Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                            For  more  information  and  examples,  see Amazon
                            Route 53 Health Checks and  DNS  Failover  in  the
                            Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                     HealthCheckId -> (string)
                        If  you  want  Amazon Route 53 to return this resource
                        record set in response to a DNS query  only  when  the
                        status  of  a  health  check  is  healthy, include the
                        HealthCheckId element and specify the ID of the appli-
                        cable health check.

                        Route  53  determines whether a resource record set is
                        healthy based on one of the following:

                        o By periodically sending a request  to  the  endpoint
                          that is specified in the health check

                        o By  aggregating  the  status of a specified group of
                          health checks (calculated health checks)

                        o By determining the current  state  of  a  CloudWatch
                          alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)

                        WARNING:
                            Route  53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint
                            that is specified in the resource record set,  for
                            example,  the endpoint specified by the IP address
                            in the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId
                            element  to a resource record set, Route 53 checks
                            the health of the endpoint that you  specified  in
                            the health check.

                        For  more information, see the following topics in the
                        Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide :

                          Is Healthy

                        o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
                            When to Specify HealthCheckId

                        Specifying  a  value  for HealthCheckId is useful only
                        when Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource
                        record  sets  to  respond to a DNS query, and you want
                        Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a
                        health  check.  Configuring  health checks makes sense
                        only in the following configurations:

                        o Non-alias resource record sets : You're checking the
                          health  of a group of non-alias resource record sets
                          that have the same routing policy,  name,  and  type
                          (such  as  multiple weighted records named www.exam-
                          ple.com with a type of A)  and  you  specify  health
                          check  IDs for all the resource record sets.  If the
                          health check status for a  resource  record  set  is
                          healthy,  Route  53  includes  the  record among the
                          records that it responds to DNS queries with. If the
                          health check status for a resource record set is un-
                          healthy, Route 53 stops responding  to  DNS  queries
                          using the value for that resource record set. If the
                          health check status for all resource record sets  in
                          the  group  is unhealthy, Route 53 considers all re-
                          source record sets in the group healthy and responds
                          to DNS queries accordingly.

                        o Alias resource record sets : You specify the follow-
                          ing settings:

                          o You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for an  alias
                            resource  record set in a group of resource record
                            sets that have the same routing policy, name,  and
                            type  (such  as  multiple  weighted  records named
                            www.example.com with a type of A).

                          o You configure the alias  resource  record  set  to
                            route  traffic  to a non-alias resource record set
                            in the same hosted zone.

                          o You specify a health check ID  for  the  non-alias
                            resource record set.

                        If  the  health check status is healthy, Route 53 con-
                        siders the alias resource record set to be healthy and
                        includes  the  alias  record among the records that it
                        responds to DNS queries with.

                        If the health check  status  is  unhealthy,  Route  53
                        stops  responding  to  DNS queries using the alias re-
                        source record set.

                        NOTE:
                               The alias resource record set  can  also  route
                               traffic to a group of non-alias resource record
                               sets that have the same routing  policy,  name,
                               and  type.  In  that  configuration,  associate
                               health checks with all of the  resource  record
                               sets  in the group of non-alias resource record
                               sets.

                            Geolocation Routing

                        For geolocation resource record sets, if  an  endpoint
                        is unhealthy, Route 53 looks for a resource record set
                        for the larger, associated geographic region. For  ex-
                        ample,  suppose  you  have  resource record sets for a
                        state in the United  States,  for  the  entire  United
                        States,  for  North America, and a resource record set
                        that has * for CountryCode is * , which applies to all
                        locations.  If  the  endpoint  for  the state resource
                        record set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks  for  healthy
                        resource  record  sets in the following order until it
                        finds a resource record set for which the endpoint  is
                        healthy:

                        o The United States

                        o North America

                        o The default resource record set
                            Specifying  the  Health  Check  Endpoint by Domain
                            Name

                        If your health checks specify the endpoint only by do-
                        main  name,  we  recommend  that you create a separate
                        health check for each endpoint. For example, create  a
                        health check for each HTTP server that is serving con-
                        tent for www.example.com . For the value of FullyQual-
                        ifiedDomainName  ,  specify  the  domain  name  of the
                        server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com ),  not  the
                        name of the resource record sets (www.example.com ).

                        WARNING:
                            Health  check results will be unpredictable if you
                            do the following:

                            o Create a health check that has  the  same  value
                              for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  as  the name of a
                              resource record set.

                            o Associate that health check  with  the  resource
                              record set.

                     TrafficPolicyInstanceId -> (string)
                        When  you  create  a  traffic  policy instance, Amazon
                        Route 53 automatically creates a resource record  set.
                        TrafficPolicyInstanceId  is the ID of the traffic pol-
                        icy instance  that  Route  53  created  this  resource
                        record set for.

                        WARNING:
                            To  delete the resource record set that is associ-
                            ated with a traffic policy instance,  use  Delete-
                            TrafficPolicyInstance  .  Route 53 will delete the
                            resource record set automatically. If  you  delete
                            the resource record set by using ChangeResourceRe-
                            cordSets , Route 53 doesn't  automatically  delete
                            the  traffic  policy instance, and you'll continue
                            to be charged for it even though it's no longer in
                            use.

                        object when you are linking a resource record set to a

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create, update, or delete a resource record set

       The  following  change-resource-record-sets  command creates a resource
       record set using the hosted-zone-id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE and the JSON-format-
       ted    configuration    in    the   file   C:\awscli\route53\change-re-
       source-record-sets.json:

          aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE --change-batch file://C:\awscli\route53\change-resource-record-sets.json

       For more information, see POST ChangeResourceRecordSets in  the  Amazon
       Route 53 API Reference.

       The  configuration  in  the  JSON  file depends on the kind of resource
       record set you want to create:

       o Basic

       o Weighted

       o Alias

       o Weighted Alias

       o Latency
