OPTIONS
       --health-check-id (string)
          The ID for the health check for which you want detailed information.
          When you created the health check, CreateHealthCheck returned the ID
          in the response, in the HealthCheckId element.

       --health-check-version (long)
          A sequential counter that Amazon Route 53 sets to 1 when you  create
          a health check and increments by 1 each time you update settings for
          the health check.

          We recommend that you use GetHealthCheck or ListHealthChecks to  get
          the  current  value  of HealthCheckVersion for the health check that
          you want to update, and that you include that value in your  Update-
          HealthCheck  request. This prevents Route 53 from overwriting an in-
          tervening update:

          o If the value in the UpdateHealthCheck request matches the value of
            HealthCheckVersion  in  the  health  check,  Route  53 updates the
            health check with the new settings.

          o If the value of HealthCheckVersion in the health check is greater,
            the  health  check  was  changed after you got the version number.
            Route 53 does not update  the  health  check,  and  it  returns  a
            HealthCheckVersionMismatch error.

       --ip-address (string)
          The  IPv4  or  IPv6 IP address for the endpoint that you want Amazon
          Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't specify  a  value
          for  IPAddress  , Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve the domain
          name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName  at  the  interval
          that  you  specify  in RequestInterval . Using an IP address that is
          returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

          Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :

          o IPv4 address : four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods
            (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

          o IPv6  address : eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated
            by          colons           (:),           for           example,
            2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345  .  You  can  also shorten
            IPv6  addresses  as  described   in   RFC   5952,   for   example,
            2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

          If  the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an
          Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify
          the  Elastic IP address for IPAddress . This ensures that the IP ad-
          dress of your instance never changes. For more information, see  the
          applicable documentation:

          o Linux: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for
            Linux Instances

          o Windows: Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2  User  Guide
            for Windows Instances

          NOTE:
              If  a  health  check already has a value for IPAddress , you can
              change the value. However, you can't update an  existing  health
              check to add or remove the value of IPAddress .

          For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

          Constraints:  Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for which
          the IP address is in  local,  private,  non-routable,  or  multicast
          ranges.  For more information about IP addresses for which you can't
          create health checks, see the following documents:

          o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

          o RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space

          o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

       --port (integer)
          The port on the endpoint that you want Amazon Route  53  to  perform
          health checks on.

          NOTE:
              Don't specify a value for Port when you specify a value for Type
              of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

       --resource-path (string)
          The path that you want Amazon Route 53 to  request  when  performing
          health  checks.  The  path  can be any value for which your endpoint
          will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when the  endpoint  is
          healthy,  for  example the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You
          can  also  include  query  string  parameters,  for  example,  /wel-
          come.html?language=jp&login=y .

          Specify this value only if you want to change it.

       --fully-qualified-domain-name (string)
          Amazon  Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a value for
          IPAddress .

          NOTE:
                 If a health check already has a value for IPAddress , you can
                 change  the  value.  However,  you  can't  update an existing
                 health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress .

              If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

          Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4  or  IPv6
          address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host
          header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typi-
          cally the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want
          Route 53 to perform health checks.

          When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it  con-
          structs the Host header:

          o If  you  specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH
            for Type , Route 53 passes the value  of  FullyQualifiedDomainName
            to the endpoint in the Host header.

          o If   you   specify   a   value  of  443  for  Port  and  HTTPS  or
            HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value of FullyQual-
            ifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

          o If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for
            Type , Route 53 passes * FullyQualifiedDomainName :Port *  to  the
            endpoint in the Host header.

          If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName , Route 53
          substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the
          above cases.
              If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

          If  you  don't  specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53 sends a DNS
          request to the domain that you specify  in  FullyQualifiedDomainName
          at  the  interval you specify in RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 ad-
          dress that is returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks  the  health  of
          the endpoint.

          If  you  don't  specify  a value for IPAddress , you cant update the
          health check to remove the FullyQualifiedDomainName ;  if  you  dont
          specify  a  value for IPAddress on creation, a FullyQualifiedDomain-
          Name is required.

          NOTE:
              If you don't specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53 uses  only
              IPv4  to  send  health checks to the endpoint. If there's no re-
              source record set with a type of A for the name that you specify
              for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  ,  the  health check fails with a
              "DNS resolution failed" error.

          If you want to check the health of weighted,  latency,  or  failover
          resource  record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
          FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend that you create  a  separate
          health  check  for each endpoint. For example, create a health check
          for each HTTP server that is serving  content  for  www.example.com.
          For  the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name
          of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com ), not the name  of
          the resource record sets (www.example.com).

          WARNING:
              In  this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName
              matches the name of the resource record sets and you then  asso-
              ciate  the  health check with those resource record sets, health
              check results will be unpredictable.

          In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP , HTTPS , HTTP_STR_MATCH ,
          or  HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDo-
          mainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for
          IPAddress  .  If  the value of Type is TCP , Route 53 doesn't pass a
          Host header.

       --search-string (string)
          If the value of Type is  HTTP_STR_MATCH  or  HTTPS_STR_MATCH  ,  the
          string  that  you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the response
          body from the specified resource. If the string appears in  the  re-
          sponse  body,  Route  53  considers the resource healthy. (You can't
          change the value of Type when you update a health check.)

       --failure-threshold (integer)
          The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint  must  pass
          or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of the end-
          point from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more information,
          see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy in
          the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

          If you don't specify a value  for  FailureThreshold  ,  the  default
          value is three health checks.

       --inverted | --no-inverted (boolean)
          Specify  whether  you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of a
          health check, for example, to consider a health check unhealthy when
          it otherwise would be considered healthy.

       --disabled | --no-disabled (boolean)
          Stops  Route  53  from  performing health checks. When you disable a
          health check, here's what happens:

          o Health checks that check the health of endpoints: Route  53  stops
            submitting  requests  to  your  application,  server, or other re-
            source.

          o Calculated health checks: Route 53 stops aggregating the status of
            the referenced health checks.

          o Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms: Route 53 stops moni-
            toring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

          After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the  status  of
          the  health  check  to  always  be  healthy.  If  you configured DNS
          failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to  the  corresponding
          resources. If you want to stop routing traffic to a resource, change
          the value of Inverted .

          Charges for a health check still apply when the health check is dis-
          abled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing .

       --health-threshold (integer)
          The  number of child health checks that are associated with a CALCU-
          LATED health that Amazon Route 53 must consider healthy for the CAL-
          CULATED  health check to be considered healthy. To specify the child
          health checks that you want to associate with  a  CALCULATED  health
          check, use the ChildHealthChecks and ChildHealthCheck elements.

          Note the following:

          o If  you  specify  a number greater than the number of child health
            checks, Route 53 always considers this  health  check  to  be  un-
            healthy.

          o If  you specify 0 , Route 53 always considers this health check to
            be healthy.

       --child-health-checks (list)
          A complex type that contains one ChildHealthCheck element  for  each
          health  check  that  you  want to associate with a CALCULATED health
          check.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enable-sni | --no-enable-sni (boolean)
          Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value  of  Ful-
          lyQualifiedDomainName  to  the  endpoint in the client_hello message
          during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to HTTPS
          health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

          Some  endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in
          the client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the
          health  check  will  be SSL alert handshake_failure . A health check
          can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is  enabled  and
          you're  still  getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on
          your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid.

          The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain  name  in
          the  Common  Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Al-
          ternative Names field. One of the domain names  in  the  certificate
          should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName
          . If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with  a  cer-
          tificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in
          FullyQualifiedDomainName , a health checker  will  retry  the  hand-
          shake.  In  the  second  attempt,  the health checker will omit Ful-
          lyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

       --regions (list)
          A complex type that contains one Region element for each region that
          you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the specified end-
          point from.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            us-east-1
            us-west-1
            us-west-2
            eu-west-1
            ap-southeast-1
            ap-southeast-2
            ap-northeast-1
            sa-east-1

       --alarm-identifier (structure)
          A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm  that  you  want
          Amazon  Route  53  health  checkers  to use to determine whether the
          specified health check is healthy.

          Region -> (string)
              For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health  checkers
              to  use  to  determine whether this health check is healthy, the
              region that the alarm was created in.

              For the current list of CloudWatch regions,  see  Amazon  Cloud-
              Watch  endpoints  and  quotas in the Amazon Web Services General
              Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon  Route  53
              health checkers to use to determine whether this health check is
              healthy.

              NOTE:
                 Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the  following  fea-
                 tures:

                 o Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics aren't
                   supported. For more information, see  High-Resolution  Met-
                   rics in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                 o Statistics:  Average,  Minimum,  Maximum,  Sum, and Sample-
                   Count. Extended statistics aren't supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Region=string,Name=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "Region": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"ca-central-1"|"eu-central-1"|"eu-central-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"me-central-1"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-south-2"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"cn-northwest-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1"|"eu-south-2"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-4"|"il-central-1"|"ca-west-1"|"ap-southeast-5",
            "Name": "string"
          }

       --insufficient-data-health-status (string)
          When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to  determine
          the  alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign
          to the health check:

          o Healthy : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

          o Unhealthy : Route 53 considers the health check to be unhealthy.

          o LastKnownStatus : By default, Route 53  uses  the  status  of  the
            health  check from the last time CloudWatch had sufficient data to
            determine the alarm state. For new health checks that have no last
            known status, the status for the health check is healthy.

          Possible values:

          o Healthy

          o Unhealthy

          o LastKnownStatus

       --reset-elements (list)
          A  complex  type that contains one ResettableElementName element for
          each element that you want to reset to the default value. Valid val-
          ues for ResettableElementName include the following:

          o ChildHealthChecks  :  Amazon  Route 53 resets ChildHealthChecks to
            null.

          o FullyQualifiedDomainName       :       Route       53       resets
            FullyQualifiedDomainName . to null.

          o Regions  :  Route 53 resets the Regions list to the default set of
            regions.

          o ResourcePath : Route 53 resets ResourcePath to null.

          (string)

       Syntax:

            Regions
            ResourcePath
            ChildHealthChecks

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates

OUTPUT
       HealthCheck -> (structure)
          A  complex  type  that contains the response to an UpdateHealthCheck
          request.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the health check
              when  you  created  it. When you add or update a resource record
              set, you use this value to specify which health  check  to  use.
              The value can be up to 64 characters long.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A  unique  string that you specified when you created the health
              check.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If the health check was created by another service, the  service
              that created the health check. When a health check is created by
              another service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon  Route
              53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, the service that created the resource.  When  a  re-
                 source  is  created  by  another  service,  you can't edit or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              Description -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  an optional description that can be provided by the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  contains  detailed information about one
              health check.

              IPAddress -> (string)
                 The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the  endpoint  that  you  want
                 Amazon  Route  53  to  perform health checks on. If you don't
                 specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53 sends a DNS  request
                 to  resolve  the  domain name that you specify in FullyQuali-
                 fiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestIn-
                 terval  .  Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route 53 then
                 checks the health of the endpoint.

                 Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :

                 o IPv4 address : four values between 0 and 255, separated  by
                   periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

                 o IPv6  address  :  eight  groups of four hexadecimal values,
                   separated     by     colons     (:),      for      example,
                   2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345   .  You  can  also
                   shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for  exam-
                   ple, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

                 If  the  endpoint  is  an EC2 instance, we recommend that you
                 create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2  in-
                 stance,  and  specify  the Elastic IP address for IPAddress .
                 This ensures that the IP address of your instance will  never
                 change.

                 For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

                 Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for
                 which the IP address is in local, private,  non-routable,  or
                 multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
                 which you can't create health checks, see the following docu-
                 ments:

                 o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

                 o RFC  6598,  IANA-Reserved  IPv4  Prefix  for Shared Address
                   Space

                 o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

                 When the value of Type is CALCULATED or  CLOUDWATCH_METRIC  ,
                 omit IPAddress .

              Port -> (integer)
                 The  port  on  the  endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to
                 perform health checks on.

                 NOTE:
                     Don't specify a value for Port when you specify  a  value
                     for Type of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an  endpoint  is
                 healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change  the  value of Type after you create a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish  a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.  If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o HTTP_STR_MATCH  : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connec-
                   tion. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP  request  and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o HTTPS_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connec-
                   tion.  If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

                 o CLOUDWATCH_METRIC  :  The health check is associated with a
                   CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm  is  OK  ,  the
                   health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM ,
                   the health check is  considered  unhealthy.  If  CloudWatch
                   doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state
                   is OK or ALARM , the health check  status  depends  on  the
                   setting  for  InsufficientDataHealthStatus  : Healthy , Un-
                   healthy , or LastKnownStatus .

                 o CALCULATED : For health checks that monitor the  status  of
                   other  health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of health
                   checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
                   and  compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold
                   .

                 o RECOVERY_CONTROL : The health check is  associated  with  a
                   Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If
                   the routing control state is ON , the health check is  con-
                   sidered  healthy. If the state is OFF , the health check is
                   considered unhealthy.

                 For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether  an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The  path,  if  any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request
                 when performing health checks. The path can be any value  for
                 which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
                 3xx when the endpoint  is  healthy,  for  example,  the  file
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html.  You  can also include query
                 string parameters, for example, /welcome.html?language=jp&lo-
                 gin=y .

              FullyQualifiedDomainName -> (string)
                 Amazon  Route  53  behavior  depends on whether you specify a
                 value for IPAddress .
                     If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the  specified
                 IPv4  or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualified-
                 DomainName in the Host header for all  health  checks  except
                 TCP  health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS
                 name of the endpoint on which you want Route  53  to  perform
                 health checks.

                 When  Route  53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how
                 it constructs the Host header:

                 o If you  specify  a  value  of  80  for  Port  and  HTTP  or
                   HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value of Ful-
                   lyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 o If you specify a  value  of  443  for  Port  and  HTTPS  or
                   HTTPS_STR_MATCH  for  Type  ,  Route 53 passes the value of
                   FullyQualifiedDomainName  to  the  endpoint  in  the   Host
                   header.

                 o If  you specify another value for Port and any value except
                   TCP  for  Type  ,  Route  53  passes  FullyQualifiedDomain-
                   Name:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 If  you  don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName ,
                 Route 53 substitutes the  value  of  IPAddress  in  the  Host
                 header in each of the preceding cases.
                     If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Route  53  sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify
                 for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify
                 for RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns,
                 Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress  ,  Route  53
                     uses  only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If
                     there's no resource record set with a type of A  for  the
                     name  that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName , the
                     health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

                 If you want to check the  health  of  weighted,  latency,  or
                 failover  resource  record sets and you choose to specify the
                 endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend that
                 you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For ex-
                 ample, create a health check for each  HTTP  server  that  is
                 serving  content  for  www.example.com. For the value of Ful-
                 lyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the server
                 (such  as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the re-
                 source record sets (www.example.com).

                 WARNING:
                     In this configuration, if you create a health  check  for
                     which  the  value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the
                     name of the resource record sets and you  then  associate
                     the  health check with those resource record sets, health
                     check results will be unpredictable.

                 In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP ,
                 HTTPS , HTTP_STR_MATCH , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route 53 passes
                 the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header,  as
                 it does when you specify a value for IPAddress . If the value
                 of Type is TCP , Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

              SearchString -> (string)
                 If the value of Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or  HTTPS_STR_MATCH  ,
                 the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the
                 response body from the specified resource. If the string  ap-
                 pears  in  the response body, Route 53 considers the resource
                 healthy.

                 Route 53 considers case when searching  for  SearchString  in
                 the response body.

              RequestInterval -> (integer)
                 The  number  of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53
                 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends
                 the  next  health check request. Each Route 53 health checker
                 makes requests at this interval.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of RequestInterval  after  you
                     create a health check.

                 If  you  don't  specify a value for RequestInterval , the de-
                 fault value is 30 seconds.

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status
                 of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa.  For
                 more  information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether
                 an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
                 .

                 If  you  don't specify a value for FailureThreshold , the de-
                 fault value is three health checks.

              MeasureLatency -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure  the  la-
                 tency between health checkers in multiple Amazon Web Services
                 regions and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch  latency
                 graphs on the Health Checks page in the Route 53 console.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change  the value of MeasureLatency after you
                     create a health check.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status
                 of  a  health  check, for example, to consider a health check
                 unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

              Disabled -> (boolean)
                 Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When  you  dis-
                 able a health check, here's what happens:

                 o Health  checks that check the health of endpoints: Route 53
                   stops submitting requests to your application,  server,  or
                   other resource.

                 o Calculated  health  checks:  Route 53 stops aggregating the
                   status of the referenced health checks.

                 o Health checks that  monitor  CloudWatch  alarms:  Route  53
                   stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

                 After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the sta-
                 tus of the health check to always be healthy. If you  config-
                 ured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
                 corresponding resources. If you want to stop routing  traffic
                 to a resource, change the value of Inverted .

                 Charges  for a health check still apply when the health check
                 is disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53  Pric-
                 ing .

              HealthThreshold -> (integer)
                 The  number of child health checks that are associated with a
                 CALCULATED health check that Amazon Route  53  must  consider
                 healthy  for  the  CALCULATED  health  check to be considered
                 healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want  to
                 associate   with   a   CALCULATED   health   check,  use  the
                 ChildHealthChecks element.

                 Note the following:

                 o If you specify a number greater than the  number  of  child
                   health  checks, Route 53 always considers this health check
                   to be unhealthy.

                 o If you specify 0 , Route 53 always  considers  this  health
                   check to be healthy.

              ChildHealthChecks -> (list)
                 (CALCULATED  Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains
                 one ChildHealthCheck element for each health check  that  you
                 want to associate with a CALCULATED health check.

                 (string)

              EnableSNI -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
                 FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the  client_hello
                 message  during  TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to
                 respond to HTTPS health check requests  with  the  applicable
                 SSL/TLS certificate.

                 Some  endpoints  require that HTTPS requests include the host
                 name in the client_hello message. If you  don't  enable  SNI,
                 the  status  of  the  health  check  will  be SSL alert hand-
                 shake_failure . A health check can also have that status  for
                 other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the
                 error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your  endpoint  and
                 confirm that your certificate is valid.

                 The  SSL/TLS  certificate  on your endpoint includes a domain
                 name in the Common Name field and possibly  several  more  in
                 the  Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names
                 in the certificate should match the value  that  you  specify
                 for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  .  If the endpoint responds to
                 the client_hello message with a certificate that does not in-
                 clude the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDo-
                 mainName , a health checker will retry the handshake. In  the
                 second  attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualified-
                 DomainName from the client_hello message.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A complex type that contains one Region element for each  re-
                 gion  from  which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to
                 check the specified endpoint.

                 If you don't specify any regions, Route  53  health  checkers
                 automatically  performs  checks  from all of the regions that
                 are listed under Valid Values .

                 If you update a health check to remove a region that has been
                 performing  health  checks, Route 53 will briefly continue to
                 perform checks from that region to ensure  that  some  health
                 checkers  are  always  checking the endpoint (for example, if
                 you replace three regions with four different regions).

                 (string)

              AlarmIdentifier -> (structure)
                 A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that  you
                 want  Amazon  Route  53  health  checkers to use to determine
                 whether the specified health check is healthy.

                 Region -> (string)
                     For the CloudWatch alarm that you want  Route  53  health
                     checkers to use to determine whether this health check is
                     healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

                     For the current list of CloudWatch  regions,  see  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  endpoints  and  quotas in the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices General Reference .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudWatch alarm  that  you  want  Amazon
                     Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether this
                     health check is healthy.

                     NOTE:
                        Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following
                        features:

                        o Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics
                          aren't  supported.   For   more   information,   see
                          High-Resolution  Metrics  in  the  Amazon CloudWatch
                          User Guide .

                        o Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and Sam-
                          pleCount. Extended statistics aren't supported.

              InsufficientDataHealthStatus -> (string)
                 When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to de-
                 termine the alarm state, the  status  that  you  want  Amazon
                 Route 53 to assign to the health check:

                 o Healthy  :  Route  53  considers  the  health  check  to be
                   healthy.

                 o Unhealthy : Route 53 considers the health check to  be  un-
                   healthy.

                 o LastKnownStatus  :  Route  53 uses the status of the health
                   check from the last time  that  CloudWatch  had  sufficient
                   data  to  determine  the alarm state. For new health checks
                   that have no last known status, the default status for  the
                   health check is healthy.

              RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the Route 53 Application
                 Recovery Controller routing control.

                 For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
                 troller,  see Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Devel-
                 oper Guide. .

          HealthCheckVersion -> (long)
              The version of the health check. You can  optionally  pass  this
              value  in a call to UpdateHealthCheck to prevent overwriting an-
              other change to the health check.

          CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information  about  the  CloudWatch
              alarm that Amazon Route 53 is monitoring for this health check.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the number of periods that the  metric  is  compared  to  the
                 threshold.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the value the metric is compared with.

                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the duration of one evaluation period in seconds.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm  is  associ-
                 ated with.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The  namespace  of  the  metric  that the alarm is associated
                 with. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces,
                 Dimensions,  and  Metrics  Reference in the Amazon CloudWatch
