LIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES-BYLIST-TRAFFIC-POLICY-INSTANCES-BY-HOSTED-ZONE()



NAME
       list-traffic-policy-instances-by-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the traffic policy instances that you created in
       a specified hosted zone.

       NOTE:
          After you submit a  CreateTrafficPolicyInstance  or  an  UpdateTraf-
          ficPolicyInstance  request, there's a brief delay while Amazon Route
          53 creates the resource record sets that are specified in the  traf-
          fic  policy definition. For more information, see the State response
          element.

       Route 53 returns a maximum of 100 items in each response. If you have a
       lot  of traffic policy instances, you can use the MaxItems parameter to
       list them in groups of up to 100.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-traffic-policy-instances-by-hosted-zone
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          [--traffic-policy-instance-name-marker <value>]
          [--traffic-policy-instance-type-marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to list traffic  policy  in-
          stances for.

       --traffic-policy-instance-name-marker (string)
          If  the  value  of IsTruncated in the previous response is true, you
          have more traffic policy instances. To get more traffic  policy  in-
          stances,  submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstances request. For the
          value of trafficpolicyinstancename ,  specify  the  value  of  Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceNameMarker from the previous response, which is the
          name of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traf-
          fic policy instances.

          If  the  value  of  IsTruncated in the previous response was false ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

       --traffic-policy-instance-type-marker (string)
          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous response  is  true,  you
          have  more  traffic policy instances. To get more traffic policy in-
          stances, submit another ListTrafficPolicyInstances request. For  the
          value  of  trafficpolicyinstancetype  ,  specify  the value of Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker from the previous response, which is the
          type of the first traffic policy instance in the next group of traf-
          fic policy instances.

          If the value of IsTruncated in the previous  response  was  false  ,
          there are no more traffic policy instances to get.

          Possible values:

          o SOA

          o A

          o TXT

          o NS

          o CNAME

          o MX

          o NAPTR

          o PTR

          o SRV

          o SPF

          o AAAA

          o CAA

          o DS

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of traffic policy instances to be included in the
          response body for this request. If you have more than MaxItems traf-
          fic  policy  instances,  the value of the IsTruncated element in the
          response is true , and the  values  of  HostedZoneIdMarker  ,  Traf-
          ficPolicyInstanceNameMarker  ,  and  TrafficPolicyInstanceTypeMarker
          represent the first traffic policy instance  that  Amazon  Route  53
          will return if you submit another request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

                 The DNS type that Amazon Route 53 assigned to all of the  re-
