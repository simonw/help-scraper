CREATE-HOSTED-ZONE()                                      CREATE-HOSTED-ZONE()



NAME
       create-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  public or private hosted zone. You create records in a
       public hosted zone to define how you want to route traffic on  the  in-
       ternet  for a domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (apex.ex-
       ample.com, acme.example.com). You create records in  a  private  hosted
       zone  to define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its sub-
       domains within one or more Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (Amazon VPCs).

       WARNING:
          You can't convert a public hosted zone to a private hosted  zone  or
          vice versa. Instead, you must create a new hosted zone with the same
          name and create new resource record sets.

       For more information about charges for hosted zones, see  Amazon  Route
       53 Pricing .

       Note the following:

       o You  can't  create a hosted zone for a top-level domain (TLD) such as
         .com.

       o For public hosted zones, Route 53 automatically creates a default SOA
         record  and  four NS records for the zone. For more information about
         SOA and NS records, see NS and SOA Records that Route 53 Creates  for
         a Hosted Zone in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide . If you want to
         use the same name servers for multiple public hosted zones,  you  can
         optionally  associate a reusable delegation set with the hosted zone.
         See the DelegationSetId element.

       o If your domain is registered with a registrar other  than  Route  53,
         you must update the name servers with your registrar to make Route 53
         the DNS service for the domain. For more information,  see  Migrating
         DNS  Service  for an Existing Domain to Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon
         Route 53 Developer Guide .

       When you submit a CreateHostedZone request, the initial status  of  the
       hosted  zone  is PENDING . For public hosted zones, this means that the
       NS and SOA records are not yet available on all Route 53  DNS  servers.
       When  the  NS  and  SOA  records  are available, the status of the zone
       changes to INSYNC .

       The CreateHostedZone request requires the caller  to  have  an  ec2:De-
       scribeVpcs permission.

       NOTE:
          When  creating  private  hosted zones, the Amazon VPC must belong to
          the same partition where the hosted zone is created. A partition  is
          a group of Amazon Web Services Regions. Each Amazon Web Services ac-
          count is scoped to one partition.

          The following are the supported partitions:

          o aws - Amazon Web Services Regions

          o aws-cn - China Regions

          o aws-us-gov - Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Region

          For more information, see Access Management in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices General Reference .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of the domain. Specify a fully qualified domain name, for
          example, www.example.com . The  trailing  dot  is  optional;  Amazon
          Route 53 assumes that the domain name is fully qualified. This means
          that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a  trailing  dot)  and
          www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

          If  you're  creating a public hosted zone, this is the name you have
          registered with your DNS registrar. If your domain  name  is  regis-
          tered  with a registrar other than Route 53, change the name servers
          for your domain to the set of NameServers that CreateHostedZone  re-
          turns in DelegationSet .

       --vpc (structure)
          (Private hosted zones only) A complex type that contains information
          about the Amazon VPC that you're associating with this hosted zone.

          You can specify only one Amazon VPC when you create a private hosted
          zone.  If you are associating a VPC with a hosted zone with this re-
          quest, the paramaters VPCId and VPCRegion are also required.

          To associate additional  Amazon  VPCs  with  the  hosted  zone,  use
          AssociateVPCWithHostedZone after you create a hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",
            "VPCId": "string"
          }

       --caller-reference (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request and that  allows  failed
          CreateHostedZone  requests to be retried without the risk of execut-
          ing the operation twice.  You  must  use  a  unique  CallerReference
          string  every time you submit a CreateHostedZone request. CallerRef-
          erence can be any unique string, for example, a date/time stamp.

       --hosted-zone-config (structure)
          (Optional) A complex type that contains the following optional  val-
          ues:

          o For public and private hosted zones, an optional comment

          o For private hosted zones, an optional PrivateZone element

          If  you  don't  specify  a  comment or the PrivateZone element, omit
          HostedZoneConfig and the other elements.

          Comment -> (string)
              Any comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

          PrivateZone -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

       Note do not include PrivateZone in this input structure. Its  value  is
       returned in the output to the command.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Comment=string,PrivateZone=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Comment": "string",
            "PrivateZone": true|false
          }

       --delegation-set-id (string)
          If  you want to associate a reusable delegation set with this hosted
          zone, the ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the  reusable  delega-
          tion  set  when  you created it. For more information about reusable
          delegation sets, see CreateReusableDelegationSet .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a hosted zone

       The following create-hosted-zone command adds a hosted zone named exam-
       ple.com  using the caller reference 2014-04-01-18:47. The optional com-
       ment includes a space, so it must be enclosed in quotation marks:

          aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name example.com --caller-reference 2014-04-01-18:47 --hosted-zone-config Comment="command-line version"

       For more information, see Working with Hosted Zones in the Amazon Route
       53 Developer Guide.
