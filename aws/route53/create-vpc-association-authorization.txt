CREATE-VPC-ASSOCIATION-AUTHORIZATION()  CREATE-VPC-ASSOCIATION-AUTHORIZATION()



NAME
       create-vpc-association-authorization -

DESCRIPTION
       Authorizes the Amazon Web Services account that created a specified VPC
       to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request to  associate  the  VPC
       with  a  specified hosted zone that was created by a different account.
       To submit a CreateVPCAssociationAuthorization request, you must use the
       account  that created the hosted zone. After you authorize the associa-
       tion, use the account that created  the  VPC  to  submit  an  Associat-
       eVPCWithHostedZone request.

       NOTE:
          If you want to associate multiple VPCs that you created by using one
          account with a hosted zone that you created by using a different ac-
          count, you must submit one authorization request for each VPC.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vpc-association-authorization
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --vpc <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the private hosted zone that you want to authorize associ-
          ating a VPC with.

       --vpc (structure)
          A complex type that contains the VPC ID and region for the VPC  that
          you want to authorize associating with your hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",
            "VPCId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HostedZoneId -> (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that  you  authorized  associating  a  VPC
          with.

       VPC -> (structure)
          The VPC that you authorized associating with a hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.
