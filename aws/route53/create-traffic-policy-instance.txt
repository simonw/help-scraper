NAME
       create-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  resource  record  sets in a specified hosted zone based on the
       settings in a specified traffic policy version.  In  addition,  Create-
       TrafficPolicyInstance associates the resource record sets with a speci-
       fied domain name (such as  example.com)  or  subdomain  name  (such  as
       www.example.com).  Amazon  Route 53 responds to DNS queries for the do-
       main or subdomain name by using the resource record sets  that  Create-
       TrafficPolicyInstance created.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-traffic-policy-instance
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --name <value>
          --ttl <value>
          --traffic-policy-id <value>
          --traffic-policy-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the hosted zone that you want Amazon Route 53 to create
          resource record sets in by using the configuration in a traffic pol-
          icy.

       --name (string)
          The  domain  name  (such  as example.com) or subdomain name (such as
          www.example.com) for which Amazon Route 53 responds to  DNS  queries
          by  using  the  resource  record sets that Route 53 creates for this
          traffic policy instance.

       --ttl (long)
          (Optional) The TTL that you want Amazon Route 53 to assign to all of
          the  resource  record  sets  that it creates in the specified hosted
          zone.

       --traffic-policy-id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy that you want to use to create resource
          record sets in the specified hosted zone.

       --traffic-policy-version (integer)
          The version of the traffic policy that you want to use to create re-
          source record sets in the specified hosted zone.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicyInstance -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains settings for the new traffic policy in-
          stance.

          Id -> (string)
              The  ID  that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the new traffic policy
              instance.

          HostedZoneId -> (string)
              The ID of the hosted zone that Amazon Route 53 created  resource
              record sets in.

          Name -> (string)
              The DNS name, such as www.example.com, for which Amazon Route 53
              responds to queries by using the resource record sets  that  are
              associated with this traffic policy instance.

          TTL -> (long)
              The  TTL  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigned to all of the resource
              record sets that it created in the specified hosted zone.

          State -> (string)
              The value of State is one of the following values:
                 Applied

              Amazon Route 53 has finished creating resource record sets,  and
              changes have propagated to all Route 53 edge locations.
                 Creating

              Route  53  is  creating  the  resource record sets. Use GetTraf-
              ficPolicyInstance to  confirm  that  the  CreateTrafficPolicyIn-
              stance request completed successfully.
                 Failed

              Route  53  wasn't  able  to create or update the resource record
              sets. When the value of State is Failed , see Message for an ex-

          Message -> (string)

              ure. If State is another value, Message is empty.

          TrafficPolicyId -> (string)
              The ID of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to create
              resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

          TrafficPolicyVersion -> (integer)
              The  version  of the traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 used to
              create resource record sets in the specified hosted zone.

          TrafficPolicyType -> (string)
              The DNS type that Amazon Route 53 assigned to  all  of  the  re-
              source  record  sets that it created for this traffic policy in-
              stance.

       Location -> (string)
          A unique URL that represents a new traffic policy instance.
