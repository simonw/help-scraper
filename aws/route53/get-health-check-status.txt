       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-health-check-status
          --health-check-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --health-check-id (string)
          The  ID  for  the health check that you want the current status for.
          When you created the health check, CreateHealthCheck returned the ID
          in the response, in the HealthCheckId element.

          NOTE:
              If  you  want  to check the status of a calculated health check,
              you must use the Amazon Route 53 console or the CloudWatch  con-
              sole.  You can't use GetHealthCheckStatus to get the status of a
              calculated health check.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
