NAME
       update-hosted-zone-comment -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the comment for a specified hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-hosted-zone-comment
          --id <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID for the hosted zone that you want to update the comment for.

       --comment (string)
          The  new  comment  for the hosted zone. If you don't specify a value
          for Comment , Amazon Route 53 deletes the existing value of the Com-
          ment element, if any.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HostedZone -> (structure)
          A  complex  type  that  contains  the  response to the UpdateHosted-
          ZoneComment request.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
              created it.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  domain. For public hosted zones, this is the
              name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

              For information about how to specify characters other than a-z ,
              0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain
              names, see CreateHostedZone .

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The value that you specified for CallerReference when  you  cre-
              ated the hosted zone.

          Config -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
              ments. If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment  elements
              from  the  request, the Config and Comment elements don't appear
              in the response.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

              PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

          ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
              The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If the hosted zone was created by another service,  the  service
              that  created  the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is created by
              another service, you can't edit or delete it using Route 53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a re-
                 source is created by  another  service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              Description -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, an optional description that can be provided by  the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.
