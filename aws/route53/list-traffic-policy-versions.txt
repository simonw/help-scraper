NAME
       list-traffic-policy-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about all of the versions for a specified traffic pol-
       icy.

       Traffic policy versions are listed in numerical order by  VersionNumber
       .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-traffic-policy-versions
          --id <value>
          [--traffic-policy-version-marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Specify  the value of Id of the traffic policy for which you want to
          list all versions.

       --traffic-policy-version-marker (string)
          For your first request to ListTrafficPolicyVersions , don't  include
          the TrafficPolicyVersionMarker parameter.

          If  you have more traffic policy versions than the value of MaxItems
          , ListTrafficPolicyVersions returns only the first group of MaxItems
          versions.  To get more traffic policy versions, submit another List-
          TrafficPolicyVersions request. For the  value  of  TrafficPolicyVer-
          sionMarker  , specify the value of TrafficPolicyVersionMarker in the
          previous response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of traffic policy versions that you  want  Amazon
          Route  53  to  include in the response body for this request. If the
          specified traffic policy has more than MaxItems versions, the  value
          of  IsTruncated in the response is true , and the value of the Traf-
          ficPolicyVersionMarker element is the ID of the first  version  that
          Route 53 will return if you submit another request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicies -> (list)
          A list that contains one TrafficPolicy element for each traffic pol-
          icy version that is associated with the specified traffic policy.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains settings for a traffic policy.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to a traffic policy when
                 you created it.

              Version -> (integer)
                 The  version number that Amazon Route 53 assigns to a traffic
                 policy. For a new traffic policy, the value of Version is al-
                 ways 1.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name that you specified when you created the traffic pol-
                 icy.

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53
                 creates  when  you  use  a traffic policy to create a traffic
                 policy instance.

              Document -> (string)
                 The definition of a traffic policy in JSON format. You  spec-
                 ify  the JSON document to use for a new traffic policy in the
                 CreateTrafficPolicy request. For more information  about  the
                 JSON format, see Traffic Policy Document Format .

              Comment -> (string)
                 The  comment  that you specify in the CreateTrafficPolicy re-
                 quest, if any.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policies to  be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          traffic policies by submitting another ListTrafficPolicyVersions re-
          quest  and  specifying the value of NextMarker in the marker parame-
          ter.

       TrafficPolicyVersionMarker -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true ,  the  value  of  TrafficPolicyVersionMarker
          identifies the first traffic policy that Amazon Route 53 will return
          if you submit another request. Call ListTrafficPolicyVersions  again
          and  specify  the  value  of TrafficPolicyVersionMarker in the Traf-
          ficPolicyVersionMarker request parameter.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the List-
          TrafficPolicyVersions request that produced the current response.
