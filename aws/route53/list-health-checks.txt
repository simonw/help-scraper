LIST-HEALTH-CHECKS()                                      LIST-HEALTH-CHECKS()



NAME
       list-health-checks -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a list of the health checks that are associated with the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-health-checks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: HealthChecks

SYNOPSIS
            list-health-checks
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the health checks associated with the current AWS account

       The following list-health-checks  command  lists  detailed  information
       about  the first 100 health checks that are associated with the current
       AWS account.:

          aws route53 list-health-checks

       If you have more than 100 health checks, or if you want to list them in
       groups smaller than 100, include the --maxitems parameter. For example,
       to list health checks one at a time, use the following command:

          aws route53 list-health-checks --max-items 1

       To view the next health check, take the value of NextToken from the re-
       sponse  to the previous command, and include it in the --starting-token
       parameter, for example:

          aws route53 list-health-checks --max-items 1 --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       HealthChecks -> (list)
          A complex type that contains one HealthCheck element for each health
          check  that  is  associated with the current Amazon Web Services ac-
          count.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about one health  check
              that is associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  that  Amazon Route 53 assigned to the health
                 check when you created it. When you add or update a  resource
                 record  set, you use this value to specify which health check
                 to use. The value can be up to 64 characters long.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique string that  you  specified  when  you  created  the
                 health check.

              LinkedService -> (structure)
                 If  the health check was created by another service, the ser-
                 vice that created the health check. When a  health  check  is
                 created by another service, you can't edit or delete it using
                 Amazon Route 53.

                 ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a
                     resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
                     delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 Description -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service, an optional description that can be provided  by
                     the  other service. When a resource is created by another
                     service, you can't edit or delete it using  Amazon  Route
                     53.

              HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that contains detailed information about one
                 health check.

                 IPAddress -> (string)
                     The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want
                     Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks on. If you don't
                     specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53 sends a DNS  re-
                     quest to resolve the domain name that you specify in Ful-
                     lyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in
                     RequestInterval  .  Using  an IP address returned by DNS,
                     Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

                     Use one of the following formats for the value  of  IPAd-
                     dress :

                     o IPv4 address : four values between 0 and 255, separated
                       by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

                     o IPv6 address : eight groups of four hexadecimal values,
                       separated     by     colons     (:),    for    example,
                       2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 . You can  also
                       shorten  IPv6  addresses  as described in RFC 5952, for
                       example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

                     If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you
                     create  an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2
                     instance, and specify the Elastic IP  address  for  IPAd-
                     dress . This ensures that the IP address of your instance
                     will never change.

                     For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

                     Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints
                     for   which   the   IP  address  is  in  local,  private,
                     non-routable, or multicast ranges. For  more  information
                     about  IP  addresses  for  which  you can't create health
                     checks, see the following documents:

                     o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

                     o RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared  Address
                       Space

                     o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

                     When the value of Type is CALCULATED or CLOUDWATCH_METRIC
                     , omit IPAddress .

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port on the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to
                     perform health checks on.

                     NOTE:
                        Don't  specify  a  value  for  Port when you specify a
                        value for Type of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The type of health check that you want to  create,  which
                     indicates  how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an end-
                     point is healthy.

                     WARNING:
                        You can't change the value of Type after you create  a
                        health check.

                     You can create the following types of health checks:

                     o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                       successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and  waits
                       for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than
                       400.

                     o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a  TCP  connection.
                       If  successful,  Route  53 submits an HTTPS request and
                       waits for an HTTP status code of  200  or  greater  and
                       less than 400.

                     WARNING:
                        If  you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the end-
                        point must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                     o HTTP_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP con-
                       nection.  If  successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTP re-
                       quest and searches the first 5,120  bytes  of  the  re-
                       sponse  body for the string that you specify in Search-
                       String .

                     o HTTPS_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries  to  establish  a  TCP
                       connection.  If  successful,  Route 53 submits an HTTPS
                       request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of  the  re-
                       sponse  body for the string that you specify in Search-
                       String .

                     o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

                     o CLOUDWATCH_METRIC : The health check is associated with
                       a  CloudWatch  alarm. If the state of the alarm is OK ,
                       the health check is considered healthy. If the state is
                       ALARM  ,  the  health check is considered unhealthy. If
                       CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient  data  to  determine
                       whether  the  state  is  OK or ALARM , the health check
                       status depends on  the  setting  for  InsufficientData-
                       HealthStatus : Healthy , Unhealthy , or LastKnownStatus
                       .

                     o CALCULATED : For health checks that monitor the  status
                       of  other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of
                       health checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to
                       be  healthy  and compares that number with the value of
                       HealthThreshold .

                     o RECOVERY_CONTROL : The health check is assocated with a
                       Route53  Application  Recovery  Controller routing con-
                       trol. If the routing control state is ON ,  the  health
                       check  is considered healthy. If the state is OFF , the
                       health check is considered unhealthy.

                     For more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether
                     an  Endpoint  Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer
                     Guide .

                 ResourcePath -> (string)
                     The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route  53  to  re-
                     quest  when performing health checks. The path can be any
                     value for which your endpoint will return an HTTP  status
                     code  of 2xx or 3xx when the endpoint is healthy, for ex-
                     ample, the file /docs/route53-health-check.html. You  can
                     also  include query string parameters, for example, /wel-
                     come.html?language=jp&login=y .

                 FullyQualifiedDomainName -> (string)
                     Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a
                     value for IPAddress .
                        If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

                     Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the speci-
                     fied IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the  value  of  Ful-
                     lyQualifiedDomainName  in  the Host header for all health
                     checks except TCP health checks. This  is  typically  the
                     fully  qualified  DNS  name  of the endpoint on which you
                     want Route 53 to perform health checks.

                     When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint,  here  is
                     how it constructs the Host header:

                     o If  you  specify  a  value  of  80 for Port and HTTP or
                       HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value  of
                       FullyQualifiedDomainName  to  the  endpoint in the Host
                       header.

                     o If you specify a value of 443 for  Port  and  HTTPS  or
                       HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value of
                       FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint  in  the  Host
                       header.

                     o If you specify another value for Port and any value ex-
                       cept TCP for Type , Route 53  passes  FullyQualifiedDo-
                       mainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.

                     If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName
                     , Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host
                     header in each of the preceding cases.
                        If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

                     Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you spec-
                     ify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you
                     specify  for RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 address that
                     DNS returns, Route 53 then checks the health of the  end-
                     point.

                     NOTE:
                        If  you don't specify a value for IPAddress , Route 53
                        uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the  endpoint.
                        If there's no resource record set with a type of A for
                        the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName
                        ,  the  health  check  fails  with  a  "DNS resolution
                        failed" error.

                     If you want to check the health of weighted, latency,  or
                     failover  resource  record sets and you choose to specify
                     the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recom-
                     mend  that  you  create  a separate health check for each
                     endpoint. For example, create a  health  check  for  each
                     HTTP  server that is serving content for www.example.com.
                     For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName ,  specify  the
                     domain  name  of  the server (such as us-east-2-www.exam-
                     ple.com), not  the  name  of  the  resource  record  sets
                     (www.example.com).

                     WARNING:
                        In  this  configuration,  if you create a health check
                        for  which  the  value   of   FullyQualifiedDomainName
                        matches  the  name of the resource record sets and you
                        then associate the health check  with  those  resource
                        record  sets,  health  check  results  will  be unpre-
                        dictable.

                     In addition, if the value that you specify  for  Type  is
                     HTTP  ,  HTTPS  ,  HTTP_STR_MATCH  , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH ,
                     Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName  in
                     the  Host header, as it does when you specify a value for
                     IPAddress . If the value  of  Type  is  TCP  ,  Route  53
                     doesn't pass a Host header.

                 SearchString -> (string)
                     If the value of Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or HTTPS_STR_MATCH
                     , the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search  for
                     in  the response body from the specified resource. If the
                     string appears in the response body, Route  53  considers
                     the resource healthy.

                     Route  53  considers case when searching for SearchString
                     in the response body.

                 RequestInterval -> (integer)
                     The number of seconds between the time that Amazon  Route
                     53  gets  a response from your endpoint and the time that
                     it sends the next health check  request.  Each  Route  53
                     health checker makes requests at this interval.

                     WARNING:
                        You  can't  change  the value of RequestInterval after
                        you create a health check.

                     If you don't specify a value for  RequestInterval  ,  the
                     default value is 30 seconds.

                 FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                     The  number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint
                     must pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the  cur-
                     rent  status of the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or
                     vice versa. For more information, see How Amazon Route 53
                     Determines  Whether  an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon
                     Route 53 Developer Guide .

                     If you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold  ,  the
                     default value is three health checks.

                 MeasureLatency -> (boolean)
                     Specify  whether  you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the
                     latency between health checkers in  multiple  Amazon  Web
                     Services regions and your endpoint, and to display Cloud-
                     Watch latency graphs on the Health  Checks  page  in  the
                     Route 53 console.

                     WARNING:
                        You can't change the value of MeasureLatency after you
                        create a health check.

                 Inverted -> (boolean)
                     Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53  to  invert  the
                     status  of  a  health  check,  for example, to consider a
                     health check unhealthy when it otherwise would be consid-
                     ered healthy.

                 Disabled -> (boolean)
                     Stops  Route  53  from performing health checks. When you
                     disable a health check, here's what happens:

                     o Health checks that check the health of endpoints: Route
                       53  stops  submitting  requests  to  your  application,
                       server, or other resource.

                     o Calculated health checks: Route  53  stops  aggregating
                       the status of the referenced health checks.

                     o Health  checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms: Route 53
                       stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

                     After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers  the
                     status  of  the health check to always be healthy. If you
                     configured DNS failover,  Route  53  continues  to  route
                     traffic  to  the  corresponding resources. If you want to
                     stop routing traffic to a resource, change the  value  of
                     Inverted .

                     Charges  for  a  health check still apply when the health
                     check is disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route
                     53 Pricing .

                 HealthThreshold -> (integer)
                     The  number  of  child  health checks that are associated
                     with a CALCULATED health check that Amazon Route 53  must
                     consider  healthy  for  the CALCULATED health check to be
                     considered healthy. To specify the  child  health  checks
                     that  you  want  to  associate  with  a CALCULATED health
                     check, use the ChildHealthChecks element.

                     Note the following:

                     o If you specify a number  greater  than  the  number  of
                       child  health  checks,  Route  53 always considers this
                       health check to be unhealthy.

                     o If you specify 0  ,  Route  53  always  considers  this
                       health check to be healthy.

                 ChildHealthChecks -> (list)
                     (CALCULATED  Health Checks Only) A complex type that con-
                     tains one ChildHealthCheck element for each health  check
                     that  you  want  to  associate  with  a CALCULATED health
                     check.

                     (string)

                 EnableSNI -> (boolean)
                     Specify whether you want Amazon  Route  53  to  send  the
                     value  of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the
                     client_hello message during TLS negotiation. This  allows
                     the  endpoint  to  respond to HTTPS health check requests
                     with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate.

                     Some endpoints require that HTTPS  requests  include  the
                     host  name  in the client_hello message. If you don't en-
                     able SNI, the status of the  health  check  will  be  SSL
                     alert  handshake_failure  .  A health check can also have
                     that status for other reasons.  If  SNI  is  enabled  and
                     you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS config-
                     uration on your endpoint and confirm that  your  certifi-
                     cate is valid.

                     The  SSL/TLS  certificate on your endpoint includes a do-
                     main name in the Common Name field and  possibly  several
                     more  in  the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the
                     domain names in the certificate should  match  the  value
                     that  you  specify  for FullyQualifiedDomainName . If the
                     endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a cer-
                     tificate  that  does not include the domain name that you
                     specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName , a health  checker
                     will  retry  the  handshake.  In  the second attempt, the
                     health checker will  omit  FullyQualifiedDomainName  from
                     the client_hello message.

                 Regions -> (list)
                     A  complex type that contains one Region element for each
                     region from which you want Amazon Route 53 health  check-
                     ers to check the specified endpoint.

                     If  you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health check-
                     ers automatically performs checks from all of the regions
                     that are listed under Valid Values .

                     If  you update a health check to remove a region that has
                     been performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly con-
                     tinue  to  perform checks from that region to ensure that
                     some health checkers are  always  checking  the  endpoint
                     (for example, if you replace three regions with four dif-
                     ferent regions).

                     (string)

                 AlarmIdentifier -> (structure)
                     A complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm  that
                     you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to deter-
                     mine whether the specified health check is healthy.

                     Region -> (string)
                        For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health
                        checkers to use to determine whether this health check
                        is healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

                        For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see Amazon
                        CloudWatch endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices General Reference .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the CloudWatch alarm that you want  Amazon
                        Route  53  health checkers to use to determine whether
                        this health check is healthy.

                        NOTE:
                            Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the  fol-
                            lowing features:

                            o Standard-resolution   metrics.   High-resolution
                              metrics aren't supported. For more  information,
                              see High-Resolution Metrics in the Amazon Cloud-
                              Watch User Guide .

                            o Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum,  and
                              SampleCount.  Extended  statistics  aren't  sup-
                              ported.

                 InsufficientDataHealthStatus -> (string)
                     When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to
                     determine  the alarm state, the status that you want Ama-
                     zon Route 53 to assign to the health check:

                     o Healthy : Route 53 considers the  health  check  to  be
                       healthy.

                     o Unhealthy  :  Route 53 considers the health check to be
                       unhealthy.

                     o LastKnownStatus : Route  53  uses  the  status  of  the
                       health  check  from  the  last time that CloudWatch had
                       sufficient data to determine the alarm state.  For  new
                       health  checks  that have no last known status, the de-
                       fault status for the health check is healthy.

                 RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Route 53  Applica-
                     tion Recovery Controller routing control.

                     Controller, see Route 53 Application Recovery  Controller
                     Developer Guide. .

              HealthCheckVersion -> (long)
                 The version of the health check. You can optionally pass this
                 value in a call to UpdateHealthCheck to  prevent  overwriting
                 another change to the health check.

              CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about the CloudWatch
                 alarm that Amazon Route 53  is  monitoring  for  this  health
                 check.

                 EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                     For  the  metric  that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                     with, the number of periods that the metric  is  compared
                     to the threshold.

                 Threshold -> (double)
                     For  the  metric  that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                     with, the value the metric is compared with.

                 ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                     For the metric that the CloudWatch  alarm  is  associated
                     with,  the arithmetic operation that is used for the com-
                     parison.

                 Period -> (integer)
                     For the metric that the CloudWatch  alarm  is  associated
                     with, the duration of one evaluation period in seconds.

                 MetricName -> (string)
                     The name of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is asso-
                     ciated with.

                 Namespace -> (string)
                     The namespace of the metric that the alarm is  associated
                     with.  For  more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Name-
                     spaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference in  the  Amazon
                     CloudWatch User Guide .

                 Statistic -> (string)
                     For  the  metric  that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                     with, the statistic that is applied to the metric.

                 Dimensions -> (list)
                     For the metric that the CloudWatch  alarm  is  associated
                     with,  a complex type that contains information about the
                     dimensions for the metric. For  information,  see  Amazon
                     CloudWatch  Namespaces, Dimensions, and Metrics Reference
                     in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                     (structure)
                        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                        with,  a  complex type that contains information about
                        one dimension.

                        Name -> (string)
                            For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is  asso-
                            ciated with, the name of one dimension.

                        Value -> (string)
                            For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is asso-
                            ciated with, the value of one dimension.

       Marker -> (string)
          For the second and subsequent calls to ListHealthChecks , Marker  is
          the  value that you specified for the marker parameter in the previ-
          ous request.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more  health  checks  to  be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          health checks by submitting  another  ListHealthChecks  request  and
          specifying the value of NextMarker in the marker parameter.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If  IsTruncated  is  true  ,  the value of NextMarker identifies the
          first health check that Amazon Route 53 returns if  you  submit  an-
          other  ListHealthChecks  request and specify the value of NextMarker
          in the marker parameter.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the  call
          to ListHealthChecks that produced the current response.
