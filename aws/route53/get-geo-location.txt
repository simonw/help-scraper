GET-GEO-LOCATION()                                          GET-GEO-LOCATION()



NAME
       get-geo-location -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about whether a specified geographic location is sup-
       ported for Amazon Route 53 geolocation resource record sets.

       Route 53 does not perform authorization for this  API  because  it  re-
       trieves information that is already available to the public.

       Use  the following syntax to determine whether a continent is supported
       for geolocation:

          ``
          GET  /2013-04-01/geolocation?continentcode=*two-letter  abbreviation
          for a continent* ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 30)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       Use  the  following  syntax to determine whether a country is supported
       for geolocation:

          ``
          GET /2013-04-01/geolocation?countrycode=*two-character country code*
          ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 38)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       Use  the following syntax to determine whether a subdivision of a coun-
       try is supported for geolocation:

          ``
          GET /2013-04-01/geolocation?countrycode=*two-character country code*
          &subdivisioncode=*subdivision code* ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 46)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

SYNOPSIS
            get-geo-location
          [--continent-code <value>]
          [--country-code <value>]
          [--subdivision-code <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --continent-code (string)
          For geolocation resource record sets, a two-letter abbreviation that
          identifies a continent. Amazon Route 53 supports the following  con-
          tinent codes:

          o AF : Africa

          o AN : Antarctica

          o AS : Asia

          o EU : Europe

          o OC : Oceania

          o NA : North America

          o SA : South America

       --country-code (string)
          Amazon Route 53 uses the two-letter country codes that are specified
          in ISO standard 3166-1 alpha-2 .

       --subdivision-code (string)
          The code for the subdivision, such as a particular state within  the
          United States. For a list of US state abbreviations, see Appendix B:
          TwoLetter State and Possession Abbreviations on  the  United  States
          Postal  Service  website.  For  a  list of all supported subdivision
          codes, use the ListGeoLocations API.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GeoLocationDetails -> (structure)
          A  complex type that contains the codes and full continent, country,
          and subdivision names for the specified geolocation code.

          ContinentCode -> (string)
              The two-letter code for the continent.

          ContinentName -> (string)
              The full name of the continent.

          CountryCode -> (string)
              The two-letter code for the country.

          CountryName -> (string)
              The name of the country.

          SubdivisionCode -> (string)
              The code for the subdivision, such as a particular state  within
              the  United  States.  For  a list of US state abbreviations, see
              Appendix B: TwoLetter State and Possession Abbreviations on  the
              United  States  Postal  Service  website. For a list of all sup-
              ported subdivision codes, use the ListGeoLocations API.

          SubdivisionName -> (string)
              The full name of the subdivision. Route  53  currently  supports
              only states in the United States.
