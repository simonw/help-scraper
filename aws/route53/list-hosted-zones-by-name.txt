LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-NAME()                        LIST-HOSTED-ZONES-BY-NAME()



NAME
       list-hosted-zones-by-name -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of your hosted zones in lexicographic order. The re-
       sponse includes a HostedZones child element for each hosted  zone  cre-
       ated by the current Amazon Web Services account.
          ListHostedZonesByName sorts hosted zones by name with the labels re-
          versed. For example:

          com.example.www.

       Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order in some  circum-
       stances.

       If  the domain name includes escape characters or Punycode, ListHosted-
       ZonesByName alphabetizes the domain name using the escaped or Punycoded
       value,  which is the format that Amazon Route 53 saves in its database.
       For example, to create  a  hosted  zone  for  exmple.com,  you  specify
       ex344mple.com  for  the domain name. ListHostedZonesByName alphabetizes
       it as:
          com.ex\344mple.

       The labels are reversed and alphabetized using the escaped  value.  For
       more  information  about  valid domain name formats, including interna-
       tionalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route
       53 Developer Guide .

       Route 53 returns up to 100 items in each response. If you have a lot of
       hosted zones, use the MaxItems parameter to list them in groups  of  up
       to  100. The response includes values that help navigate from one group
       of MaxItems hosted zones to the next:

       o The DNSName and HostedZoneId elements in  the  response  contain  the
         values, if any, specified for the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters
         in the request that produced the current response.

       o The MaxItems element in the response contains the value, if any, that
         you specified for the maxitems parameter in the request that produced
         the current response.

       o If the value of IsTruncated in the response is true, there  are  more
         hosted zones associated with the current Amazon Web Services account.
         If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the last hosted  zone
         that  is associated with the current account. The NextDNSName element
         and NextHostedZoneId elements are omitted from the response.

       o The NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements in the response contain
         the  domain  name and the hosted zone ID of the next hosted zone that
         is associated with the current Amazon Web Services  account.  If  you
         want to list more hosted zones, make another call to ListHostedZones-
         ByName , and specify the value of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in
         the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters, respectively.

OPTIONS
       --dns-name (string)
          (Optional) For your first request to ListHostedZonesByName , include
          the dnsname parameter only if you want to specify the  name  of  the
          first  hosted zone in the response. If you don't include the dnsname
          parameter, Amazon Route 53 returns all of the hosted zones that were
          created  by the current Amazon Web Services account, in ASCII order.
          For subsequent requests, include both dnsname and  hostedzoneid  pa-
          rameters.  For  dnsname  , specify the value of NextDNSName from the
          previous response.

       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          (Optional) For your first request to ListHostedZonesByName , do  not
          include the hostedzoneid parameter.

          If you have more hosted zones than the value of maxitems , ListHost-
          edZonesByName returns only the first maxitems hosted zones.  To  get
          the  next  group of maxitems hosted zones, submit another request to
          ListHostedZonesByName and include both dnsname and hostedzoneid  pa-
          rameters.  For  the value of hostedzoneid , specify the value of the
          NextHostedZoneId element from the previous response.

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of hosted zones to be included  in  the  response
          body  for this request. If you have more than maxitems hosted zones,
          then the value of the IsTruncated element in the response  is  true,
          and the values of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId specify the first
          hosted zone in the next group of maxitems hosted zones.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       HostedZones -> (list)
          A  complex  type  that contains general information about the hosted
          zone.

          (structure)
              A complex type  that  contains  general  information  about  the
              hosted zone.

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when
                 you created it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the domain. For public hosted zones, this is  the
                 name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

                 For  information  about  how to specify characters other than
                 a-z , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify  international-
                 ized domain names, see CreateHostedZone .

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 The  value  that  you  specified for CallerReference when you
                 created the hosted zone.

              Config -> (structure)
                 A complex type that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
                 ments.  If  you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment ele-
                 ments from the request, the Config and Comment elements don't
                 appear in the response.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     Any  comments  that  you want to include about the hosted
                     zone.

                 PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                     A value that indicates whether this is a  private  hosted
                     zone.

              ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
                 The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

              LinkedService -> (structure)
                 If  the  hosted zone was created by another service, the ser-
                 vice that created the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is cre-
                 ated  by  another  service, you can't edit or delete it using
                 Route 53.

                 ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a
                     resource is created by another service, you can't edit or
                     delete it using Amazon Route 53.

                 Description -> (string)
                     If the health check or hosted zone was created by another
                     service, an optional description that can be provided  by
                     the  other service. When a resource is created by another
                     service, you can't edit or delete it using  Amazon  Route
                     53.

       DNSName -> (string)
          For  the  second  and  subsequent  calls  to ListHostedZonesByName ,
          DNSName is the value that you specified for the dnsname parameter in
          the request that produced the current response.

       HostedZoneId -> (string)
          The  ID  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
          created it.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are  more  hosted  zones  to  be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          maxitems hosted zones by  calling  ListHostedZonesByName  again  and
          specifying  the  values of NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId elements
          in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters.

       NextDNSName -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true, the value of NextDNSName is the name of  the
          first  hosted  zone in the next group of maxitems hosted zones. Call
          ListHostedZonesByName again and specify the value of NextDNSName and
          NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and hostedzoneid parameters, respec-
          tively.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       NextHostedZoneId -> (string)
          If IsTruncated is true , the value  of  NextHostedZoneId  identifies
          the  first  hosted  zone in the next group of maxitems hosted zones.
          Call  ListHostedZonesByName  again  and   specify   the   value   of
          NextDNSName and NextHostedZoneId in the dnsname and hostedzoneid pa-
          rameters, respectively.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the maxitems parameter in the  call
          to ListHostedZonesByName that produced the current response.
