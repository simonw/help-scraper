NAME
       get-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about a specified hosted zone including the four name
       servers assigned to the hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-hosted-zone
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that you want to get information about.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get information about a hosted zone

       The following get-hosted-zone command gets information about the hosted
       zone with an id of Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE:

          aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id Z1R8UBAEXAMPLE

OUTPUT
       HostedZone -> (structure)
          A complex type that contains general information about the specified
          hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the hosted zone when you
              created it.

          Name -> (string)
              The  name  of  the  domain. For public hosted zones, this is the
              name that you have registered with your DNS registrar.

              For information about how to specify characters other than a-z ,
              0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain
              names, see CreateHostedZone .

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The value that you specified for CallerReference when  you  cre-
              ated the hosted zone.

          Config -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that includes the Comment and PrivateZone ele-
              ments. If you omitted the HostedZoneConfig and Comment  elements
              from  the  request, the Config and Comment elements don't appear
              in the response.

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments that you want to include about the hosted zone.

              PrivateZone -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether this is a private hosted zone.

          ResourceRecordSetCount -> (long)
              The number of resource record sets in the hosted zone.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If the hosted zone was created by another service,  the  service
              that  created  the hosted zone. When a hosted zone is created by
              another service, you can't edit or delete it using Route 53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a re-
                 source is created by  another  service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              Description -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, an optional description that can be provided by  the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

       DelegationSet -> (structure)
          A complex type that lists the Amazon Route 53 name servers  for  the
          specified hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              The  ID  that  Amazon  Route 53 assigns to a reusable delegation
              set.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              The value that you specified for CallerReference when  you  cre-
              ated the reusable delegation set.

          NameServers -> (list)
              A  complex  type  that contains a list of the authoritative name
              servers for a hosted zone or for a reusable delegation set.

              (string)

       VPCs -> (list)
          A complex type that contains information about the VPCs that are as-
          sociated with the specified hosted zone.

          (structure)
              (Private  hosted zones only) A complex type that contains infor-
              mation about an Amazon VPC.

              If you associate a private hosted zone with an Amazon  VPC  when
              you  make  a  CreateHostedZone request, the following parameters
              are also required.

              VPCRegion -> (string)
                 (Private hosted zones only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
                 created in.
