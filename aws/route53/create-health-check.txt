CREATE-HEALTH-CHECK()                                    CREATE-HEALTH-CHECK()



NAME
       create-health-check -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new health check.

       For information about adding health checks to resource record sets, see
       HealthCheckId in ChangeResourceRecordSets .
          ELB Load Balancers

       If you're registering EC2 instances  with  an  Elastic  Load  Balancing
       (ELB)  load  balancer,  do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for
       the EC2 instances. When you register an EC2 instance with a  load  bal-
       ancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, which performs a
       similar function to a Route 53 health check.
          Private Hosted Zones

       You can associate health checks with failover resource record sets in a
       private hosted zone. Note the following:

       o Route  53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the health of
         an endpoint within a VPC by IP address, you must assign a  public  IP
         address to the instance in the VPC.

       o You can configure a health checker to check the health of an external
         resource that the instance relies on, such as a database server.

       o You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm with the  met-
         ric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of the
         alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatch metric that  checks
         the  status  of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add an alarm
         to the metric, and then create a health check that is  based  on  the
         state of the alarm. For information about creating CloudWatch metrics
         and alarms by using the CloudWatch console, see the Amazon CloudWatch
         User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --caller-reference (string)
          A  unique  string that identifies the request and that allows you to
          retry a failed CreateHealthCheck request without the risk of  creat-
          ing two identical health checks:

          o If you send a CreateHealthCheck request with the same CallerRefer-
            ence and settings as a previous request, and if the  health  check
            doesn't  exist,  Amazon  Route 53 creates the health check. If the
            health check does exist, Route 53 returns the settings for the ex-
            isting health check.

          o If you send a CreateHealthCheck request with the same CallerRefer-
            ence as a deleted health check, regardless of the settings,  Route
            53 returns a HealthCheckAlreadyExists error.

          o If you send a CreateHealthCheck request with the same CallerRefer-
            ence as an existing health  check  but  with  different  settings,
            Route 53 returns a HealthCheckAlreadyExists error.

          o If you send a CreateHealthCheck request with a unique CallerRefer-
            ence but settings identical to an existing health check, Route  53
            creates the health check.

          Route  53  does  not  store the CallerReference for a deleted health
          check indefinitely. The CallerReference for a deleted  health  check
          will be deleted after a number of days.

       --health-check-config (structure)
          A complex type that contains settings for a new health check.

          IPAddress -> (string)
              The IPv4 or IPv6 IP address of the endpoint that you want Amazon
              Route 53 to perform health checks on. If  you  don't  specify  a
              value  for  IPAddress  , Route 53 sends a DNS request to resolve
              the domain name that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName  at
              the  interval  that you specify in RequestInterval . Using an IP
              address returned by DNS, Route 53 then checks the health of  the
              endpoint.

              Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :

              o IPv4 address : four values between 0 and 255, separated by pe-
                riods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

              o IPv6 address : eight groups of four hexadecimal values,  sepa-
                rated       by       colons       (:),       for      example,
                2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345 . You can also shorten
                IPv6   addresses  as  described  in  RFC  5952,  for  example,
                2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

              If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create
              an  Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and
              specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress . This ensures that
              the IP address of your instance will never change.

              For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

              Constraints:  Route  53  can't check the health of endpoints for
              which the IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or mul-
              ticast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for which
              you can't create health checks, see the following documents:

              o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

              o RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space

              o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

              When the value of Type is CALCULATED or CLOUDWATCH_METRIC , omit
              IPAddress .

          Port -> (integer)
              The  port  on the endpoint that you want Amazon Route 53 to per-
              form health checks on.

              NOTE:
                 Don't specify a value for Port when you specify a  value  for
                 Type of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

          Type -> (string)
              The  type  of  health check that you want to create, which indi-
              cates how Amazon Route 53  determines  whether  an  endpoint  is
              healthy.

              WARNING:
                 You  can't change the value of Type after you create a health
                 check.

              You can create the following types of health checks:

              o HTTP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.  If  suc-
                cessful,  Route  53  submits  an HTTP request and waits for an
                HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

              o HTTPS : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If  suc-
                cessful,  Route  53  submits an HTTPS request and waits for an
                HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

              WARNING:
                 If you specify HTTPS for the value of  Type  ,  the  endpoint
                 must support TLS v1.0 or later.

              o HTTP_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.
                If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request  and  searches
                the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that
                you specify in SearchString .

              o HTTPS_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish  a  TCP  connec-
                tion.  If  successful,  Route  53 submits an HTTPS request and
                searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response  body  for  the
                string that you specify in SearchString .

              o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

              o CLOUDWATCH_METRIC  :  The  health  check  is associated with a
                CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is OK , the health
                check  is  considered  healthy.  If  the  state is ALARM , the
                health check is considered unhealthy.  If  CloudWatch  doesn't
                have  sufficient  data to determine whether the state is OK or
                ALARM , the health check status depends on the setting for In-
                sufficientDataHealthStatus  :  Healthy  , Unhealthy , or Last-
                KnownStatus .

              o CALCULATED : For health checks  that  monitor  the  status  of
                other  health  checks,  Route  53 adds up the number of health
                checks that Route 53 health checkers consider  to  be  healthy
                and compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold .

              o RECOVERY_CONTROL  :  The  health  check  is  assocated  with a
                Route53 Application Recovery Controller  routing  control.  If
                the  routing control state is ON , the health check is consid-
                ered healthy. If the state is OFF , the health check  is  con-
                sidered unhealthy.

              For  more  information,  see  How Route 53 Determines Whether an
              Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

          ResourcePath -> (string)
              The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route 53 to request  when
              performing  health  checks.  The path can be any value for which
              your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx when
              the    endpoint    is    healthy,    for   example,   the   file
              /docs/route53-health-check.html.  You  can  also  include  query
              string  parameters,  for  example, /welcome.html?language=jp&lo-
              gin=y .

          FullyQualifiedDomainName -> (string)
              Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on whether you specify a  value
              for IPAddress .
                 If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

              Amazon  Route  53  sends  health check requests to the specified
              IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value  of  FullyQualifiedDo-
              mainName  in  the  Host  header for all health checks except TCP
              health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of
              the  endpoint  on  which  you  want  Route  53 to perform health
              checks.

              When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is  how  it
              constructs the Host header:

              o If   you   specify  a  value  of  80  for  Port  and  HTTP  or
                HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the  value  of  Ful-
                lyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

              o If  you  specify  a  value  of  443  for  Port  and  HTTPS  or
                HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value  of  Ful-
                lyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

              o If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP
                for Type , Route 53  passes  FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port  to
                the endpoint in the Host header.

              If  you  don't  specify  a  value for FullyQualifiedDomainName ,
              Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the  Host  header
              in each of the preceding cases.
                 If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

              Route  53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for
              FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that  you  specify  for
              RequestInterval  . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Route
              53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

              NOTE:
                 If you don't specify a value for IPAddress ,  Route  53  uses
                 only  IPv4  to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's
                 no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you
                 specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName , the health check fails
                 with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

              If you want  to  check  the  health  of  weighted,  latency,  or
              failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the end-
              point only by FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend  that  you
              create  a  separate health check for each endpoint. For example,
              create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving  con-
              tent for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomain-
              Name  ,  specify  the  domain  name  of  the  server  (such   as
              us-east-2-www.example.com),  not the name of the resource record
              sets (www.example.com).

              WARNING:
                 In this configuration, if you create a health check for which
                 the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the
                 resource record sets and you then associate the health  check
                 with those resource record sets, health check results will be
                 unpredictable.

              In addition, if the value that you specify for Type  is  HTTP  ,
              HTTPS  ,  HTTP_STR_MATCH  , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route 53 passes
              the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as  it
              does  when  you  specify a value for IPAddress . If the value of
              Type is TCP , Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

          SearchString -> (string)
              If the value of Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or HTTPS_STR_MATCH ,  the
              string  that  you  want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the re-
              sponse body from the specified resource. If the  string  appears
              in the response body, Route 53 considers the resource healthy.

              Route  53  considers case when searching for SearchString in the
              response body.

          RequestInterval -> (integer)
              The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets
              a  response  from  your  endpoint and the time that it sends the
              next health check request. Each Route 53  health  checker  makes
              requests at this interval.

              WARNING:
                 You  can't change the value of RequestInterval after you cre-
                 ate a health check.

              If you don't specify a value for RequestInterval ,  the  default
              value is 30 seconds.

          FailureThreshold -> (integer)
              The  number  of  consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
              pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status of
              the  endpoint  from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For more
              information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an  End-
              point Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              If  you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold , the default
              value is three health checks.

          MeasureLatency -> (boolean)
              Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the  latency
              between  health checkers in multiple Amazon Web Services regions
              and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency  graphs  on
              the Health Checks page in the Route 53 console.

              WARNING:
                 You can't change the value of MeasureLatency after you create
                 a health check.

          Inverted -> (boolean)
              Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status of
              a  health  check,  for  example,  to consider a health check un-
              healthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

          Disabled -> (boolean)
              Stops Route 53 from performing health checks. When you disable a
              health check, here's what happens:

              o Health  checks  that  check  the health of endpoints: Route 53
                stops submitting requests  to  your  application,  server,  or
                other resource.

              o Calculated  health checks: Route 53 stops aggregating the sta-
                tus of the referenced health checks.

              o Health checks that monitor CloudWatch alarms: Route  53  stops
                monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

              After  you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the status
              of the health check to always be healthy. If you configured  DNS
              failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the correspond-
              ing resources. If you want to stop  routing  traffic  to  a  re-
              source, change the value of Inverted .

              Charges  for a health check still apply when the health check is
              disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pricing .

          HealthThreshold -> (integer)
              The number of child health checks that  are  associated  with  a
              CALCULATED  health  check  that  Amazon  Route  53 must consider
              healthy  for  the  CALCULATED  health  check  to  be  considered
              healthy. To specify the child health checks that you want to as-
              sociate   with   a   CALCULATED   health    check,    use    the
              ChildHealthChecks element.

              Note the following:

              o If  you  specify  a  number  greater  than the number of child
                health checks, Route 53 always considers this health check  to
                be unhealthy.

              o If you specify 0 , Route 53 always considers this health check
                to be healthy.

          ChildHealthChecks -> (list)
              (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that contains one
              ChildHealthCheck  element for each health check that you want to
              associate with a CALCULATED health check.

              (string)

          EnableSNI -> (boolean)
              Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send  the  value  of
              FullyQualifiedDomainName  to  the  endpoint  in the client_hello
              message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to  re-
              spond to HTTPS health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS
              certificate.

              Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name
              in the client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI, the status
              of the health check will be  SSL  alert  handshake_failure  .  A
              health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI
              is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS
              configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate
              is valid.

              The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain  name
              in  the  Common Name field and possibly several more in the Sub-
              ject Alternative Names field. One of the  domain  names  in  the
              certificate  should  match  the  value that you specify for Ful-
              lyQualifiedDomainName  .  If  the  endpoint  responds   to   the
              client_hello  message  with  a certificate that does not include
              the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName ,
              a  health  checker  will  retry the handshake. In the second at-
              tempt, the health  checker  will  omit  FullyQualifiedDomainName
              from the client_hello message.

          Regions -> (list)
              A  complex type that contains one Region element for each region
              from which you want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to check the
              specified endpoint.

              If you don't specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers auto-
              matically performs checks from  all  of  the  regions  that  are
              listed under Valid Values .

              If  you  update  a health check to remove a region that has been
              performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly continue to per-
              form checks from that region to ensure that some health checkers
              are always checking the endpoint (for example,  if  you  replace
              three regions with four different regions).

              (string)

          AlarmIdentifier -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you
              want Amazon Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether
              the specified health check is healthy.

              Region -> (string)
                 For the CloudWatch alarm that you want Route 53 health check-
                 ers to use to determine whether this health check is healthy,
                 the region that the alarm was created in.

                 For the current list of CloudWatch regions, see Amazon Cloud-
                 Watch endpoints and quotas in the Amazon Web Services General
                 Reference .

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon Route
                 53 health checkers to use to determine  whether  this  health
                 check is healthy.

                 NOTE:
                     Route  53  supports  CloudWatch alarms with the following
                     features:

                     o Standard-resolution  metrics.  High-resolution  metrics
                       aren't    supported.    For   more   information,   see
                       High-Resolution Metrics in the Amazon  CloudWatch  User
                       Guide .

                     o Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and Sample-
                       Count. Extended statistics aren't supported.

          InsufficientDataHealthStatus -> (string)
              When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to deter-
              mine  the  alarm state, the status that you want Amazon Route 53
              to assign to the health check:

              o Healthy : Route 53 considers the health check to be healthy.

              o Unhealthy : Route 53 considers the  health  check  to  be  un-
                healthy.

              o LastKnownStatus : Route 53 uses the status of the health check
                from the last time that CloudWatch had sufficient data to  de-
                termine  the  alarm  state. For new health checks that have no
                last known status, the default status for the health check  is
                healthy.

          RoutingControlArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Route 53 Application Re-
              covery Controller routing control.

              For more information about Route 53  Application  Recovery  Con-
              troller,  see Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Developer
              Guide. .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a health check

       The following create-health-check command creates a health check  using
       the caller reference 2014-04-01-18:47 and the JSON-formatted configura-
       tion in the file C:\awscli\route53\create-health-check.json:

          aws route53 create-health-check --caller-reference 2014-04-01-18:47 --health-check-config file://C:\awscli\route53\create-health-check.json

       JSON syntax:

          {
            "IPAddress": "IP address of the endpoint to check",
            "Port": port on the endpoint to check--required when Type is "TCP",
            "Type": "HTTP"|"HTTPS"|"HTTP_STR_MATCH"|"HTTPS_STR_MATCH"|"TCP",
            "ResourcePath": "path of the file that you want Amazon Route 53 to request--all Types except TCP",
            "FullyQualifiedDomainName": "domain name of the endpoint to check--all Types except TCP",
            "SearchString": "if Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, the string to search for in the response body from the specified resource",
            "RequestInterval": 10 | 30,
            "FailureThreshold": integer between 1 and 10
          }

       To add the health check to a Route 53  resource  record  set,  use  the
       change-resource-record-sets command.

       For  more  information,  see  Amazon  Route  53  Health  Checks and DNS
       Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       HealthCheck -> (structure)
          A complex type  that  contains  identifying  information  about  the
          health check.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier that Amazon Route 53 assigned to the health check
              when you created it. When you add or update  a  resource  record
              set,  you  use  this value to specify which health check to use.
              The value can be up to 64 characters long.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique string that you specified when you created  the  health
              check.

          LinkedService -> (structure)
              If  the health check was created by another service, the service
              that created the health check. When a health check is created by
              another  service, you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route
              53.

              ServicePrincipal -> (string)
                 If the health check or hosted zone  was  created  by  another
                 service,  the  service  that created the resource. When a re-
                 source is created by  another  service,  you  can't  edit  or
                 delete it using Amazon Route 53.

              Description -> (string)
                 If  the  health  check  or hosted zone was created by another
                 service, an optional description that can be provided by  the
                 other service. When a resource is created by another service,
                 you can't edit or delete it using Amazon Route 53.

          HealthCheckConfig -> (structure)
              A complex type that  contains  detailed  information  about  one
              health check.

              IPAddress -> (string)
                 The  IPv4  or  IPv6  IP address of the endpoint that you want
                 Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks  on.  If  you  don't
                 specify  a value for IPAddress , Route 53 sends a DNS request
                 to resolve the domain name that you  specify  in  FullyQuali-
                 fiedDomainName at the interval that you specify in RequestIn-
                 terval . Using an IP address returned by DNS, Route  53  then
                 checks the health of the endpoint.

                 Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress :

                 o IPv4  address : four values between 0 and 255, separated by
                   periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44 .

                 o IPv6 address : eight groups  of  four  hexadecimal  values,
                   separated      by      colons     (:),     for     example,
                   2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345  .  You  can   also
                   shorten  IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for exam-
                   ple, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345 .

                 If the endpoint is an EC2 instance,  we  recommend  that  you
                 create  an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 in-
                 stance, and specify the Elastic IP address  for  IPAddress  .
                 This  ensures that the IP address of your instance will never
                 change.

                 For more information, see FullyQualifiedDomainName .

                 Constraints: Route 53 can't check the health of endpoints for
                 which  the  IP address is in local, private, non-routable, or
                 multicast ranges. For more information about IP addresses for
                 which you can't create health checks, see the following docu-
                 ments:

                 o RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses

                 o RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved  IPv4  Prefix  for  Shared  Address
                   Space

                 o RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

                 When  the  value of Type is CALCULATED or CLOUDWATCH_METRIC ,
                 omit IPAddress .

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port on the endpoint that you want  Amazon  Route  53  to
                 perform health checks on.

                 NOTE:
                     Don't  specify  a value for Port when you specify a value
                     for Type of CLOUDWATCH_METRIC or CALCULATED .

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of health check that you want to create, which indi-
                 cates  how  Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is
                 healthy.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of Type  after  you  create  a
                     health check.

                 You can create the following types of health checks:

                 o HTTP  :  Route  53  tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits  for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 o HTTPS  :  Route  53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If
                   successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for
                   an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type , the endpoint
                     must support TLS v1.0 or later.

                 o HTTP_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP  connec-
                   tion.  If  successful, Route 53 submits an HTTP request and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o HTTPS_STR_MATCH : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connec-
                   tion. If successful, Route 53 submits an HTTPS request  and
                   searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the
                   string that you specify in SearchString .

                 o TCP : Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.

                 o CLOUDWATCH_METRIC : The health check is associated  with  a
                   CloudWatch  alarm.  If  the  state of the alarm is OK , the
                   health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM ,
                   the  health  check  is  considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch
                   doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state
                   is  OK  or  ALARM  , the health check status depends on the
                   setting for InsufficientDataHealthStatus :  Healthy  ,  Un-
                   healthy , or LastKnownStatus .

                 o CALCULATED  :  For health checks that monitor the status of
                   other health checks, Route 53 adds up the number of  health
                   checks that Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy
                   and compares that number with the value of  HealthThreshold
                   .

                 o RECOVERY_CONTROL  :  The  health  check is assocated with a
                   Route53 Application Recovery Controller routing control. If
                   the  routing control state is ON , the health check is con-
                   sidered healthy. If the state is OFF , the health check  is
                   considered unhealthy.

                 For  more information, see How Route 53 Determines Whether an
                 Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              ResourcePath -> (string)
                 The path, if any, that you want Amazon Route  53  to  request
                 when  performing health checks. The path can be any value for
                 which your endpoint will return an HTTP status code of 2xx or
                 3xx  when  the  endpoint  is  healthy,  for example, the file
                 /docs/route53-health-check.html. You can also  include  query
                 string parameters, for example, /welcome.html?language=jp&lo-
                 gin=y .

              FullyQualifiedDomainName -> (string)
                 Amazon Route 53 behavior depends on  whether  you  specify  a
                 value for IPAddress .
                     If you specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Amazon  Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified
                 IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of  FullyQualified-
                 DomainName  in  the  Host header for all health checks except
                 TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified  DNS
                 name  of  the  endpoint on which you want Route 53 to perform
                 health checks.

                 When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here  is  how
                 it constructs the Host header:

                 o If  you  specify  a  value  of  80  for  Port  and  HTTP or
                   HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53 passes the value of Ful-
                   lyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 o If  you  specify  a  value  of  443  for  Port and HTTPS or
                   HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type , Route 53  passes  the  value  of
                   FullyQualifiedDomainName   to  the  endpoint  in  the  Host
                   header.

                 o If you specify another value for Port and any value  except
                   TCP  for  Type  ,  Route  53  passes  FullyQualifiedDomain-
                   Name:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.

                 If you don't specify a value for  FullyQualifiedDomainName  ,
                 Route  53  substitutes  the  value  of  IPAddress in the Host
                 header in each of the preceding cases.
                     If you don't specify a value for  IPAddress :

                 Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that  you  specify
                 for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify
                 for RequestInterval . Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns,
                 Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  don't  specify  a value for IPAddress , Route 53
                     uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint.  If
                     there's  no  resource record set with a type of A for the
                     name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName ,  the
                     health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.

                 If  you  want  to  check  the health of weighted, latency, or
                 failover resource record sets and you choose to  specify  the
                 endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName , we recommend that
                 you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For ex-
                 ample,  create  a  health  check for each HTTP server that is
                 serving content for www.example.com. For the  value  of  Ful-
                 lyQualifiedDomainName , specify the domain name of the server
                 (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the  re-
                 source record sets (www.example.com).

                 WARNING:
                     In  this  configuration, if you create a health check for
                     which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName  matches  the
                     name  of  the resource record sets and you then associate
                     the health check with those resource record sets,  health
                     check results will be unpredictable.

                 In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP ,
                 HTTPS , HTTP_STR_MATCH , or HTTPS_STR_MATCH , Route 53 passes
                 the  value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as
                 it does when you specify a value for IPAddress . If the value
                 of Type is TCP , Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

              SearchString -> (string)
                 If  the  value of Type is HTTP_STR_MATCH or HTTPS_STR_MATCH ,
                 the string that you want Amazon Route 53 to search for in the
                 response  body from the specified resource. If the string ap-
                 pears in the response body, Route 53 considers  the  resource
                 healthy.

                 Route  53  considers  case when searching for SearchString in
                 the response body.

              RequestInterval -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds between the time that Amazon  Route  53
                 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends
                 the next health check request. Each Route 53  health  checker
                 makes requests at this interval.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  change the value of RequestInterval after you
                     create a health check.

                 If you don't specify a value for RequestInterval  ,  the  de-
                 fault value is 30 seconds.

              FailureThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of consecutive health checks that an endpoint must
                 pass or fail for Amazon Route 53 to change the current status
                 of  the endpoint from unhealthy to healthy or vice versa. For
                 more information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines  Whether
                 an Endpoint Is Healthy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide
                 .

                 If you don't specify a value for FailureThreshold ,  the  de-
                 fault value is three health checks.

              MeasureLatency -> (boolean)
                 Specify  whether  you want Amazon Route 53 to measure the la-
                 tency between health checkers in multiple Amazon Web Services
                 regions  and your endpoint, and to display CloudWatch latency
                 graphs on the Health Checks page in the Route 53 console.

                 WARNING:
                     You can't change the value of  MeasureLatency  after  you
                     create a health check.

              Inverted -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to invert the status
                 of a health check, for example, to consider  a  health  check
                 unhealthy when it otherwise would be considered healthy.

              Disabled -> (boolean)
                 Stops  Route  53 from performing health checks. When you dis-
                 able a health check, here's what happens:

                 o Health checks that check the health of endpoints: Route  53
                   stops  submitting  requests to your application, server, or
                   other resource.

                 o Calculated health checks: Route 53  stops  aggregating  the
                   status of the referenced health checks.

                 o Health  checks  that  monitor  CloudWatch  alarms: Route 53
                   stops monitoring the corresponding CloudWatch metrics.

                 After you disable a health check, Route 53 considers the sta-
                 tus  of the health check to always be healthy. If you config-
                 ured DNS failover, Route 53 continues to route traffic to the
                 corresponding  resources. If you want to stop routing traffic
                 to a resource, change the value of Inverted .

                 Charges for a health check still apply when the health  check
                 is  disabled. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Pric-
                 ing .

              HealthThreshold -> (integer)
                 The number of child health checks that are associated with  a
                 CALCULATED  health  check  that Amazon Route 53 must consider
                 healthy for the CALCULATED  health  check  to  be  considered
                 healthy.  To specify the child health checks that you want to
                 associate  with  a   CALCULATED   health   check,   use   the
                 ChildHealthChecks element.

                 Note the following:

                 o If  you  specify  a number greater than the number of child
                   health checks, Route 53 always considers this health  check
                   to be unhealthy.

                 o If  you  specify  0 , Route 53 always considers this health
                   check to be healthy.

              ChildHealthChecks -> (list)
                 (CALCULATED Health Checks Only) A complex type that  contains
                 one  ChildHealthCheck  element for each health check that you
                 want to associate with a CALCULATED health check.

                 (string)

              EnableSNI -> (boolean)
                 Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of
                 FullyQualifiedDomainName  to the endpoint in the client_hello
                 message during TLS negotiation. This allows the  endpoint  to
                 respond  to  HTTPS  health check requests with the applicable
                 SSL/TLS certificate.

                 Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include  the  host
                 name  in  the  client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI,
                 the status of the  health  check  will  be  SSL  alert  hand-
                 shake_failure  . A health check can also have that status for
                 other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the
                 error,  check  the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and
                 confirm that your certificate is valid.

                 The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint  includes  a  domain
                 name  in  the  Common Name field and possibly several more in
                 the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain  names
                 in  the  certificate  should match the value that you specify
                 for FullyQualifiedDomainName . If the  endpoint  responds  to
                 the client_hello message with a certificate that does not in-
                 clude the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDo-
                 mainName  , a health checker will retry the handshake. In the
                 second attempt, the health checker will omit  FullyQualified-
                 DomainName from the client_hello message.

              Regions -> (list)
                 A  complex type that contains one Region element for each re-
                 gion from which you want Amazon Route 53 health  checkers  to
                 check the specified endpoint.

                 If  you  don't  specify any regions, Route 53 health checkers
                 automatically performs checks from all of  the  regions  that
                 are listed under Valid Values .

                 If you update a health check to remove a region that has been
                 performing health checks, Route 53 will briefly  continue  to
                 perform  checks  from  that region to ensure that some health
                 checkers are always checking the endpoint  (for  example,  if
                 you replace three regions with four different regions).

                 (string)

              AlarmIdentifier -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that identifies the CloudWatch alarm that you
                 want Amazon Route 53 health  checkers  to  use  to  determine
                 whether the specified health check is healthy.

                 Region -> (string)
                     For  the  CloudWatch  alarm that you want Route 53 health
                     checkers to use to determine whether this health check is
                     healthy, the region that the alarm was created in.

                     For  the  current  list of CloudWatch regions, see Amazon
                     CloudWatch endpoints and quotas in the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                     vices General Reference .

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  CloudWatch alarm that you want Amazon
                     Route 53 health checkers to use to determine whether this
                     health check is healthy.

                     NOTE:
                        Route 53 supports CloudWatch alarms with the following
                        features:

                        o Standard-resolution metrics. High-resolution metrics
                          aren't   supported.   For   more   information,  see
                          High-Resolution Metrics  in  the  Amazon  CloudWatch
                          User Guide .

                        o Statistics: Average, Minimum, Maximum, Sum, and Sam-
                          pleCount. Extended statistics aren't supported.

              InsufficientDataHealthStatus -> (string)
                 When CloudWatch has insufficient data about the metric to de-
                 termine  the  alarm  state,  the  status that you want Amazon
                 Route 53 to assign to the health check:

                 o Healthy :  Route  53  considers  the  health  check  to  be
                   healthy.

                 o Unhealthy  :  Route 53 considers the health check to be un-
                   healthy.

                 o LastKnownStatus : Route 53 uses the status  of  the  health
                   check  from  the  last  time that CloudWatch had sufficient
                   data to determine the alarm state. For  new  health  checks
                   that  have no last known status, the default status for the
                   health check is healthy.

              RoutingControlArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Route  53  Application
                 Recovery Controller routing control.

                 For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Con-
                 troller, see Route 53 Application Recovery Controller  Devel-
                 oper Guide. .

          HealthCheckVersion -> (long)
              The  version  of  the health check. You can optionally pass this
              value in a call to UpdateHealthCheck to prevent overwriting  an-
              other change to the health check.

          CloudWatchAlarmConfiguration -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that contains information about the CloudWatch
              alarm that Amazon Route 53 is monitoring for this health check.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated  with,
                 the  number  of  periods  that  the metric is compared to the
                 threshold.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated  with,
                 the value the metric is compared with.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the arithmetic operation that is used for the comparison.

              Period -> (integer)
                 For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated  with,
                 the duration of one evaluation period in seconds.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The  name  of the CloudWatch metric that the alarm is associ-
                 ated with.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric  that  the  alarm  is  associated
                 with. For more information, see Amazon CloudWatch Namespaces,
                 Dimensions, and Metrics Reference in  the  Amazon  CloudWatch
                 User Guide .

              Statistic -> (string)
                 For  the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated with,
                 the statistic that is applied to the metric.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated  with,
                 a complex type that contains information about the dimensions
                 for the metric. For information, see Amazon CloudWatch  Name-
                 spaces,  Dimensions,  and  Metrics  Reference  in  the Amazon
                 CloudWatch User Guide .

                 (structure)
                     For the metric that the CloudWatch  alarm  is  associated
                     with,  a complex type that contains information about one
                     dimension.

                     Name -> (string)
                        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                        with, the name of one dimension.

                     Value -> (string)
                        For the metric that the CloudWatch alarm is associated
                        with, the value of one dimension.
