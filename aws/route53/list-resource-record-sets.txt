LIST-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()                        LIST-RESOURCE-RECORD-SETS()



NAME
       list-resource-record-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resource record sets in a specified hosted zone.
          ListResourceRecordSets  returns  up to 300 resource record sets at a
          time in ASCII order, beginning at a position specified by  the  name
          and type elements.

          Sort order

          ListResourceRecordSets  sorts results first by DNS name with the la-
          bels reversed, for example:

          com.example.www.

       Note the trailing dot, which can change the sort order when the  record
       name contains characters that appear before . (decimal 46) in the ASCII
       table. These characters include the following: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * +  ,
       -

       When  multiple  records  have the same DNS name, ListResourceRecordSets
       sorts results by the record type.
          Specifying where to start listing records

       You can use the name and type elements to specify the  resource  record
       set that the list begins with:
          If you do not specify Name or Type

       The  results  begin  with the first resource record set that the hosted
       zone contains.
          If you specify Name but not Type

       The results begin with the first resource record set in the list  whose
       name is greater than or equal to Name .
          If you specify Type but not Name

       Amazon Route 53 returns the InvalidInput error.
          If you specify both Name and Type

       The  results begin with the first resource record set in the list whose
       name is greater than or equal to Name , and whose type is greater  than
       or equal to Type .
          Resource record sets that are PENDING

       This  action  returns the most current version of the records. This in-
       cludes records that are PENDING , and that are not yet available on all
       Route 53 DNS servers.
          Changing resource record sets

       To  ensure that you get an accurate listing of the resource record sets
       for a hosted zone at a point in time, do not submit a ChangeResourceRe-
       cordSets  request  while you're paging through the results of a ListRe-
       sourceRecordSets request. If you do, some  pages  may  display  results
       without  the  latest changes while other pages display results with the
       latest changes.
          Displaying the next page of results

       If a ListResourceRecordSets command returns more than one page  of  re-
       sults,  the  value of IsTruncated is true . To display the next page of
       results, get the values of NextRecordName , NextRecordType ,  and  Nex-
       tRecordIdentifier  (if  any)  from  the  response.  Then submit another
       ListResourceRecordSets  request,   and   specify   those   values   for
       StartRecordName , StartRecordType , and StartRecordIdentifier .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-record-sets  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ResourceRecordSets

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted zone that contains  the  resource  record  sets
          that you want to list.

       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the resource record sets in a hosted zone

       The following list-resource-record-sets command lists summary  informa-
       tion  about  the  first  100 resource record sets in a specified hosted
       zone.:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE

       If the hosted zone contains more than 100 resource record sets,  or  if
       you  want  to  list them in groups smaller than 100, include the --max-
       items parameter. For example, to list resource record  sets  one  at  a
       time, use the following command:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --max-items 1

       To  view  information  about the next resource record set in the hosted
       zone, take the value of NextToken from the  response  to  the  previous
       command, and include it in the --starting-token parameter, for example:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --max-items 1 --starting-token Z3M3LMPEXAMPLE

       To  view  all  the  resource  record sets of a particular name, use the
       --query parameter to filter them out. For example:

          aws route53 list-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z2LD58HEXAMPLE --query "ResourceRecordSets[?Name == 'example.domain.']"

OUTPUT
       ResourceRecordSets -> (list)
          Information about multiple resource record sets.

          (structure)
              Information about the resource record set to create or delete.

              Name -> (string)
                 For ChangeResourceRecordSets requests, the name of the record
                 that  you  want  to  create,  update,  or delete. For ListRe-
                 sourceRecordSets responses, the name of a record in the spec-
                 ified hosted zone.
                     ChangeResourceRecordSets Only

                 Enter  a  fully qualified domain name, for example, www.exam-
                 ple.com . You can optionally include a trailing dot.  If  you
                 omit  the  trailing dot, Amazon Route 53 assumes that the do-
                 main name that you specify is  fully  qualified.  This  means
                 that Route 53 treats www.example.com (without a trailing dot)
                 and www.example.com. (with a trailing dot) as identical.

                 For information about how to specify  characters  other  than
                 a-z  , 0-9 , and - (hyphen) and how to specify international-
                 ized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in  the  Amazon
                 Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 You can use the asterisk (*) wildcard to replace the leftmost
                 label in a domain name, for example, *.example.com . Note the
                 following:

                 o The * must replace the entire label. For example, you can't
                   specify *prod.example.com or prod*.example.com .

                 o The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for  example,
                   marketing.*.example.com.

                 o If  you  include  * in any position other than the leftmost
                   label in a domain name, DNS treats it  as  an  *  character
                   (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.

                 WARNING:
                     You  can't  use  the * wildcard for resource records sets
                     that have a type of NS.

                 You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a  domain
                 name, for example, *.example.com . You can't use an * for one
                 of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com  .
                 In  addition,  the * must replace the entire label; for exam-
                 ple, you can't specify prod*.example.com .

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS record type. For information about  different  record
                 types and how data is encoded for them, see Supported DNS Re-
                 source Record Types in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                 Valid values for basic resource record sets: A | AAAA | CAA |

                        resource record sets, specify the same value  for  all
                        of the resource record sets in the group.

                        Valid  values  for  multivalue  answer resource record

                        NOTE:
                     SPF records were formerly used to verify the identity  of
                     the  sender of email messages. However, we no longer rec-
                     ommend that you create resource record sets for which the
                     value  of Type is SPF . RFC 7208, Sender Policy Framework
                     (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version  1
                     , has been updated to say, "...[I]ts existence and mecha-
                     nism defined in [RFC4408] have led to some interoperabil-
                     ity issues. Accordingly, its use is no longer appropriate
                     for SPF version 1; implementations are not to use it." In
                     RFC 7208, see section 14.1, The SPF DNS Record Type .

                 Values for alias resource record sets:

                 o Amazon  API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized
                   APIs:  A

                 o CloudFront distributions:  A   If IPv6 is enabled  for  the
                   distribution,  create  two  resource  record  sets to route
                   traffic to your distribution, one with a value of A and one
                   with a value of AAAA .

                 o Amazon API Gateway environment that has a regionalized sub-
                   domain : A

                 o ELB load balancers:  A | AAAA

                 o Amazon S3 buckets:  A

                 o Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoints  A

                 o Another resource record set in this  hosted  zone:  Specify
                   the  type  of  the resource record set that you're creating
                   the alias for. All values are supported except NS and SOA .

                 NOTE:
                     If you're creating an alias record that has the same name
                     as  the  hosted  zone (known as the zone apex), you can't
                     route traffic to a record for which the value of Type  is
                     CNAME  .  This  is because the alias record must have the
                     same type as the record you're routing  traffic  to,  and
                     creating a CNAME record for the zone apex isn't supported
                     even for an alias record.

              SetIdentifier -> (string)
                     Resource record sets that have  a  routing  policy  other
                     than simple: An identifier that differentiates among mul-
                     tiple resource record sets that have the same combination
                     of  name  and  type,  such  as multiple weighted resource
                     record sets named acme.example.com that have a type of A.
                     In  a  group  of  resource record sets that have the same
                     name and type, the value of SetIdentifier must be  unique
                     for each resource record set.

                 For  information about routing policies, see Choosing a Rout-
                 ing Policy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              Weight -> (long)
                     Weighted resource record sets only: Among resource record
                     sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type,
                     a value that determines the  proportion  of  DNS  queries
                     that  Amazon  Route  53 responds to using the current re-
                     source record set. Route 53 calculates  the  sum  of  the
                     weights  for  the resource record sets that have the same
                     combination of DNS name and type. Route 53 then  responds
                     to  queries  based on the ratio of a resource's weight to
                     the total. Note the following:

                 o You must specify a value for the Weight element  for  every
                   weighted resource record set.

                 o You  can  only  specify one ResourceRecord per weighted re-
                   source record set.

                 o You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource
                   record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type
                   elements as weighted resource record sets.

                 o You can create a maximum of 100  weighted  resource  record
                   sets  that  have the same values for the Name and Type ele-
                   ments.

                 o For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets,
                   if  you set Weight to 0 for a resource record set, Route 53
                   never responds to queries with  the  applicable  value  for
                   that  resource  record set. However, if you set Weight to 0
                   for all resource record sets that have the same combination
                   of  DNS  name  and type, traffic is routed to all resources
                   with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight  to  0
                   is different when you associate health checks with weighted
                   resource record sets. For more information, see Options for
                   Configuring   Route  53  Active-Active  and  Active-Passive
                   Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

              Region -> (string)
                     Latency-based resource record sets only: The  Amazon  EC2
                     Region  where you created the resource that this resource
                     record set refers to. The resource typically is an Amazon
                     Web  Services resource, such as an EC2 instance or an ELB
                     load balancer, and is referred to by an IP address  or  a
                     DNS domain name, depending on the record type.

                 NOTE:
                     Although  creating  latency  and  latency  alias resource
                     record sets in a private hosted zone is allowed, it's not
                     supported.

                 When  Amazon  Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name
                 and type for which you have created latency  resource  record
                 sets,  Route  53 selects the latency resource record set that
                 has the lowest latency between the end user and  the  associ-
                 ated  Amazon EC2 Region. Route 53 then returns the value that
                 is associated with the selected resource record set.

                 Note the following:

                 o You can only specify one  ResourceRecord  per  latency  re-
                   source record set.

                 o You  can  only  create  one latency resource record set for
                   each Amazon EC2 Region.

                 o You aren't required to create latency resource record  sets
                   for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Route 53 will choose the region
                   with the best latency from among the regions that you  cre-
                   ate latency resource record sets for.

                 o You can't create non-latency resource record sets that have
                   the same values for the Name and Type elements  as  latency
                   resource record sets.

              GeoLocation -> (structure)
                     Geolocation  resource  record  sets  only: A complex type
                     that lets you control how Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS
                     queries  based on the geographic origin of the query. For
                     example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed
                     to  a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111 , cre-
                     ate a resource record set with a Type of A and  a  Conti-
                     nentCode of AF .

                 NOTE:
                     Although  creating  geolocation and geolocation alias re-
                     source record sets in a private hosted zone  is  allowed,
                     it's not supported.

                 If  you  create separate resource record sets for overlapping
                 geographic regions (for example, one resource record set  for
                 a  continent  and  one  for a country on the same continent),
                 priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This  allows
                 you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and
                 to route queries for a country on that continent to a differ-
                 ent resource.

                 You  can't  create  two geolocation resource record sets that
                 specify the same geographic location.

                 The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic
                 locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource
                 record sets that have the same values for the Name  and  Type
                 elements.

                 WARNING:
                     Geolocation  works  by mapping IP addresses to locations.
                     However, some IP addresses aren't  mapped  to  geographic
                     locations,  so  even  if  you create geolocation resource
                     record sets that cover all  seven  continents,  Route  53
                     will  receive  some  DNS  queries  from locations that it
                     can't identify. We recommend that you create  a  resource
                     record  set for which the value of CountryCode is * . Two
                     groups of queries are routed to  the  resource  that  you
                     specify  in this record: queries that come from locations
                     for which you haven't created geolocation resource record
                     sets  and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to
                     a location. If you don't create a * resource record  set,
                     Route  53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from
                     those locations.

                 You can't create non-geolocation resource  record  sets  that
                 have the same values for the Name and Type elements as geolo-
                 cation resource record sets.

                 ContinentCode -> (string)
                     The two-letter code for the continent.

                     Amazon Route 53 supports the following continent codes:

                     o AF : Africa

                     o AN : Antarctica

                     o AS : Asia

                     o EU : Europe

                     o OC : Oceania

                     o NA : North America

                     o SA : South America

                     Constraint: Specifying ContinentCode  with  either  Coun-
                     tryCode or SubdivisionCode returns an InvalidInput error.

                 CountryCode -> (string)
                     For geolocation resource record sets, the two-letter code
                     for a country.

                     Amazon Route 53 uses the two-letter  country  codes  that
                     are specified in ISO standard 3166-1 alpha-2 .

                 SubdivisionCode -> (string)
                     For geolocation resource record sets, the two-letter code
                     for a state of the United States. Route 53  doesn't  sup-
                     port any other values for SubdivisionCode . For a list of
                     state abbreviations, see Appendix B: TwoLetter State  and
                     Possession Abbreviations on the United States Postal Ser-
                     vice website.

                     If you specify subdivisioncode , you must also specify US
                     for CountryCode .

              Failover -> (string)
                     Failover   resource   record   sets  only:  To  configure
                     failover, you add the Failover element  to  two  resource
                     record  sets.  For  one  resource record set, you specify
                     PRIMARY as the value for Failover ;  for  the  other  re-
                     source  record  set, you specify SECONDARY . In addition,
                     you include the HealthCheckId  element  and  specify  the
                     health check that you want Amazon Route 53 to perform for
                     each resource record set.

                 Except where noted, the following failover  behaviors  assume
                 that  you have included the HealthCheckId element in both re-
                 source record sets:

                 o When the primary resource record set is healthy,  Route  53
                   responds  to DNS queries with the applicable value from the
                   primary resource record set regardless of the health of the
                   secondary resource record set.

                 o When  the  primary resource record set is unhealthy and the
                   secondary resource record set is healthy, Route 53 responds
                   to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary
                   resource record set.

                 o When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy,  Route
                   53  responds  to DNS queries with the applicable value from
                   the primary resource record set regardless of the health of
                   the primary resource record set.

                 o If you omit the HealthCheckId element for the secondary re-
                   source record set, and if the primary resource  record  set
                   is  unhealthy, Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with
                   the applicable value from  the  secondary  resource  record
                   set.  This  is true regardless of the health of the associ-
                   ated endpoint.

                 You can't create non-failover resource record sets that  have
                 the  same  values  for the Name and Type elements as failover
                 resource record sets.

                 For failover alias resource record sets, you  must  also  in-
                 clude  the  EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to
                 true.

                 For more information about configuring failover for Route 53,
                 see  the  following  topics  in the Amazon Route 53 Developer
                 Guide :

                 o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone

              MultiValueAnswer -> (boolean)
                     Multivalue answer resource record sets only  :  To  route
                     traffic  approximately  randomly  to  multiple resources,
                     such as web servers, create one multivalue answer  record
                     for each resource and specify true for MultiValueAnswer .
                     Note the following:

                 o If you associate a health check with  a  multivalue  answer
                   resource  record  set,  Amazon  Route  53  responds  to DNS
                   queries with the corresponding IP  address  only  when  the
                   health check is healthy.

                 o If you don't associate a health check with a multivalue an-
                   swer record, Route 53 always considers  the  record  to  be
                   healthy.

                 o Route  53  responds to DNS queries with up to eight healthy
                   records; if you have eight or fewer healthy records,  Route
                   53  responds  to  all  DNS  queries  with  all  the healthy
                   records.

                 o If you have more than eight healthy records, Route  53  re-
                   sponds  to  different DNS resolvers with different combina-
                   tions of healthy records.

                 o When all records are unhealthy, Route 53  responds  to  DNS
                   queries with up to eight unhealthy records.

                 o If a resource becomes unavailable after a resolver caches a
                   response, client software typically tries another of the IP
                   addresses in the response.

                 You can't create multivalue answer alias records.

              TTL -> (long)
                 The  resource  record  cache  time to live (TTL), in seconds.
                 Note the following:

                 o If you're creating or updating  an  alias  resource  record
                   set,  omit  TTL . Amazon Route 53 uses the value of TTL for
                   the alias target.

                 o If you're associating  this  resource  record  set  with  a
                   health check (if you're adding a HealthCheckId element), we
                   recommend that you specify a TTL of 60 seconds or  less  so
                   clients respond quickly to changes in health status.

                 o All  of the resource record sets in a group of weighted re-
                   source record sets must have the same value for TTL .

                 o If a group of weighted resource record sets includes one or
                   more  weighted  alias  resource  record  sets for which the
                   alias target is an ELB load balancer, we recommend that you
                   specify  a  TTL  of  60  seconds  for  all of the non-alias
                   weighted resource record sets that have the same  name  and
                   type.  Values  other than 60 seconds (the TTL for load bal-
                   ancers) will change the effect of the values that you spec-
                   ify for Weight .

              ResourceRecords -> (list)
                 Information about the resource records to act upon.

                 NOTE:
                     If you're creating an alias resource record set, omit Re-
                     sourceRecords .

                 (structure)
                     Information specific to the resource record.

                     NOTE:
                        If you're creating an alias resource record set,  omit
                        ResourceRecord .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The  current  or  new  DNS record value, not to exceed
                        4,000 characters. In the case of a DELETE  action,  if
                        the  current value does not match the actual value, an
                        error is returned. For descriptions about how to  for-
                        mat  Value  for  different record types, see Supported
                        DNS Resource Record Types in the Amazon Route  53  De-
                        veloper Guide .

                        You  can  specify  more  than one value for all record
                        types except CNAME and SOA .

                        NOTE:
                            If you're creating an alias resource  record  set,
                            omit Value .

              AliasTarget -> (structure)
                     Alias  resource  record  sets only: Information about the
                     Amazon Web Services resource, such as a  CloudFront  dis-
                     tribution  or an Amazon S3 bucket, that you want to route
                     traffic to.

                 If you're creating resource records sets for a private hosted
                 zone, note the following:

                 o You  can't create an alias resource record set in a private
                   hosted zone to route traffic to a CloudFront distribution.

                 o For information about  creating  failover  resource  record

                        Another Route 53 resource record set  in  your  hosted
                        zone

                     Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias
                     resource record set can't reference a resource record set
                     in a different hosted zone.)

                            edge-optimized APIs

                     Specify  the applicable domain name for your API. You can
                     get  the  applicable  value   using   the   CLI   command
                     get-domain-names :

                     o For regional APIs, specify the value of regionalDomain-
                       Name .

                     o For edge-optimized APIs, specify the value of distribu-
                       tionDomainName  .  This  is  the name of the associated
                       CloudFront  distribution,  such  as  da1b2c3d4e5.cloud-
                       front.net .

                     NOTE:
                        The name of the record that you're creating must match
                        a custom domain name for your API, such  as  api.exam-
                        ple.com .

                        Amazon Virtual Private Cloud interface VPC endpoint

                     Enter  the  API endpoint for the interface endpoint, such
                     as vpce-123456789abcdef01-example-us-east-1a.elasticload-
                     balancing.us-east-1.vpce.amazonaws.com  .  For edge-opti-
                     mized APIs, this is the domain name for the corresponding
                     CloudFront distribution. You can get the value of DnsName
                     using the CLI command describe-vpc-endpoints .
                        CloudFront distribution

                     Specify the domain name that CloudFront assigned when you
                     created your distribution.

                     Your  CloudFront  distribution  must include an alternate
                     domain name that matches the name of the resource  record
                     set.  For example, if the name of the resource record set
                     is acme.example.com , your CloudFront  distribution  must
                     include  acme.example.com  as one of the alternate domain
                     names. For more information, see Using  Alternate  Domain
                     Names (CNAMEs) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     You  can't  create  a  resource  record  set in a private
                     hosted zone to route traffic to  a  CloudFront  distribu-
                     tion.

                     NOTE:
                        For failover alias records, you can't specify a Cloud-
                        Front distribution for both the primary and  secondary
                        records.  A distribution must include an alternate do-
                        main name that matches the name of  the  record.  How-
                        ever,  the primary and secondary records have the same
                        name, and you can't include the same alternate  domain
                        name in more than one distribution.

                        Elastic Beanstalk environment

                     If the domain name for your Elastic Beanstalk environment
                     includes the region that you deployed the environment in,
                     you can create an alias record that routes traffic to the
                     environment. For example,  the  domain  name  my-environ-
                     ment.*us-west-2*  .elasticbeanstalk.com is a regionalized
                     domain name.

                     WARNING:
                        For environments that were created before early  2016,
                        the  domain  name doesn't include the region. To route
                        traffic to these environments, you must create a CNAME
                        record instead of an alias record. Note that you can't
                        create a CNAME record for the root  domain  name.  For
                        example,  if  your domain name is example.com, you can
                        create a record that  routes  traffic  for  acme.exam-
                        ple.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment, but you
                        can't create a record that routes  traffic  for  exam-
                        ple.com to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

                     For Elastic Beanstalk environments that have regionalized
                     subdomains, specify the CNAME attribute for the  environ-
                     ment.  You can use the following methods to get the value
                     of the CNAME attribute:

                     o Amazon Web Services Management Console :  For  informa-
                       tion  about  how to get the value by using the console,
                       see Using Custom Domains with Elastic Beanstalk in  the
                       Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide .

                     o Elastic  Beanstalk  API  : Use the DescribeEnvironments
                       action to get the value of  the  CNAME  attribute.  For
                       more information, see DescribeEnvironments in the Elas-
                       tic Beanstalk API Reference .

                     o CLI : Use the describe-environments command to get  the
                       value of the CNAME attribute. For more information, see
                       describe-environments in the CLI Command Reference .

                       ELB load balancer

                     Specify the DNS name that is  associated  with  the  load
                     balancer.  Get  the DNS name by using the Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices Management Console, the ELB API, or the CLI.

                     o Amazon Web Services Management Console : Go to the  EC2
                       page,  choose  Load  Balancers  in the navigation pane,
                       choose the load balancer, choose the  Description  tab,
                       and  get  the  value  of the DNS name field.  If you're
                       routing traffic to a Classic  Load  Balancer,  get  the
                       value  that  begins  with dualstack . If you're routing
                       traffic to another type of load balancer, get the value
                       that applies to the record type, A or AAAA.

                     o Elastic  Load Balancing API : Use DescribeLoadBalancers
                       to get the value of DNSName . For more information, see
                       the applicable guide:

                       o Classic Load Balancers: DescribeLoadBalancers

                       o Application     and     Network    Load    Balancers:
                         DescribeLoadBalancers

                     o CLI : Use describe-load-balancers to get the  value  of
                       DNSName  .  For  more  information,  see the applicable
                       guide:

                       Global Accelerator accelerator

                     Specify the DNS name for your accelerator:

                     o Global  Accelerator  API:  To  get  the  DNS  name, use
                       DescribeAccelerator .

                     o CLI: To get the DNS name, use describe-accelerator .

                       Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a static website

                     Specify the domain name of the Amazon S3 website endpoint
                     that  you  created  the  bucket  in, for example, s3-web-
                     site.us-east-2.amazonaws.com . For more information about
                     valid  values,  see the table Amazon S3 Website Endpoints
                     in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .  For  more
                     information  about  using  S3  buckets  for websites, see
                     Getting Started with Amazon Route 53 in the Amazon  Route
                     53 Developer Guide.
                        Another Route 53 resource record set

                     Specify  the  value  of  the  Name element for a resource
                     record set in the current hosted zone.

                     NOTE:
                        If you're creating an alias record that has  the  same
                        name  as the hosted zone (known as the zone apex), you
                        can't specify the domain name for a record  for  which
                        the value of Type is CNAME . This is because the alias
                        record must have the same  type  as  the  record  that
                        you're routing traffic to, and creating a CNAME record
                        for the zone apex isn't supported even  for  an  alias
                        record.

                 EvaluateTargetHealth -> (boolean)
                        Applies  only  to  alias,  failover alias, geolocation
                        alias, latency  alias,  and  weighted  alias  resource
                        record  sets:  When  EvaluateTargetHealth is true , an
                        alias resource record set inherits the health  of  the
                        referenced  Amazon  Web  Services resource, such as an
                        ELB load balancer or another resource  record  set  in
                        the hosted zone.

                     Note the following:
                        CloudFront distributions

                     You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias
                     target is a CloudFront distribution.
                        Elastic Beanstalk environments that have  regionalized
                        subdomains

                     If  you  specify  an  Elastic  Beanstalk  environment  in
                     DNSName and the environment contains  an  ELB  load  bal-
                     ancer,  Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the
                     healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the
                     load  balancer. (An environment automatically contains an
                     ELB load balancer if it includes more than one Amazon EC2
                     instance.)  If  you  set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and
                     either no Amazon EC2 instances are healthy  or  the  load
                     balancer  itself is unhealthy, Route 53 routes queries to
                     other available resources that are healthy, if any.

                     If the environment contains a single Amazon EC2 instance,
                     there are no special requirements.
                        ELB load balancers

                     Health checking behavior depends on the type of load bal-
                     ancer:

                     o Classic Load Balancers : If you specify an ELB  Classic
                       Load  Balancer  in  DNSName  ,  Elastic  Load Balancing
                       routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances
                       that  are registered with the load balancer. If you set
                       EvaluateTargetHealth to true  and  either  no  EC2  in-
                       stances  are healthy or the load balancer itself is un-
                       healthy, Route 53 routes queries to other resources.

                     o Application and Network Load Balancers : If you specify
                       an ELB Application or Network Load Balancer and you set
                       EvaluateTargetHealth to true , Route 53 routes  queries
                       to  the load balancer based on the health of the target
                       groups that are associated with the load balancer:

                       o For an Application or Network  Load  Balancer  to  be
                         considered  healthy, every target group that contains
                         targets must contain at least one healthy target.  If
                         any target group contains only unhealthy targets, the
                         load balancer is considered unhealthy, and  Route  53
                         routes queries to other resources.

                       o A target group that has no registered targets is con-
                         sidered unhealthy.

                     NOTE:
                        When you create a load balancer,  you  configure  set-
                        tings   for  Elastic  Load  Balancing  health  checks;
                        they're not Route 53 health checks, but they perform a
                        similar function. Do not create Route 53 health checks
                        for the EC2 instances that you register  with  an  ELB
                        load balancer.

                        S3 buckets

                     There  are  no special requirements for setting Evaluate-
                     TargetHealth to true when  the  alias  target  is  an  S3
                     bucket.
                        Other records in the same hosted zone

                     If  the  Amazon Web Services resource that you specify in
                     DNSName is a record or a group of records (for example, a
                     group  of  weighted  records)  but  is  not another alias
                     record, we recommend that you associate  a  health  check
                     with all of the records in the alias target. For more in-
                     formation, see What Happens When You Omit Health  Checks?
                     in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

                     For  more  information  and examples, see Amazon Route 53
                     Health Checks and DNS Failover in the Amazon Route 53 De-
                     veloper Guide .

              HealthCheckId -> (string)
                 If  you  want  Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record
                 set in response to a DNS query only  when  the  status  of  a
                 health  check  is  healthy, include the HealthCheckId element
                 and specify the ID of the applicable health check.

                 Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is  healthy
                 based on one of the following:

                 o By  periodically  sending a request to the endpoint that is
                   specified in the health check

                 o By aggregating the status of a specified  group  of  health
                   checks (calculated health checks)

                 o By  determining  the  current  state  of a CloudWatch alarm
                   (CloudWatch metric health checks)

                 WARNING:
                     Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint that is
                     specified  in  the  resource record set, for example, the
                     endpoint specified by the IP address in  the  Value  ele-
                     ment.  When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource
                     record set, Route 53 checks the health  of  the  endpoint
                     that you specified in the health check.

                 For  more information, see the following topics in the Amazon
                 Route 53 Developer Guide :

                 o Configuring Failover in a Private Hosted Zone
                     When to Specify HealthCheckId

                 Specifying  a  value  for  HealthCheckId  is useful only when
                 Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets
                 to  respond to a DNS query, and you want Route 53 to base the
                 choice in part on the status of a health  check.  Configuring
                 health  checks  makes  sense only in the following configura-
                 tions:

                 o Non-alias resource record sets : You're checking the health
                   of  a group of non-alias resource record sets that have the
                   same routing policy,  name,  and  type  (such  as  multiple
                   weighted  records  named  www.example.com with a type of A)
                   and you specify health  check  IDs  for  all  the  resource
                   record  sets.   If  the  health check status for a resource
                   record set is healthy, Route 53 includes the  record  among
                   the  records  that  it responds to DNS queries with. If the
                   health check status for a resource record set is unhealthy,
                   Route  53  stops  responding to DNS queries using the value
                   for that resource record set. If the  health  check  status
                   for  all  resource  record  sets in the group is unhealthy,
                   Route 53 considers all resource record sets  in  the  group
                   healthy and responds to DNS queries accordingly.

                 o Alias resource record sets : You specify the following set-
                   tings:

                   o You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true  for  an  alias  re-
                     source record set in a group of resource record sets that
                     have the same routing policy, name,  and  type  (such  as
                     multiple  weighted  records  named www.example.com with a
                     type of A).

                   o You configure the alias  resource  record  set  to  route
                     traffic  to  a  non-alias resource record set in the same
                     hosted zone.

                   o You specify a health check ID for the non-alias  resource
                     record set.

                 If the health check status is healthy, Route 53 considers the
                 alias resource record set to  be  healthy  and  includes  the
                 alias  record  among  the  records  that  it  responds to DNS
                 queries with.

                 If the health check status is unhealthy, Route 53  stops  re-
                 sponding to DNS queries using the alias resource record set.

                 NOTE:
                        The  alias  resource record set can also route traffic
                        to a group of non-alias resource record sets that have
                        the  same routing policy, name, and type. In that con-
                        figuration, associate health checks with  all  of  the
                        resource  record  sets  in  the group of non-alias re-
                        source record sets.

                     Geolocation Routing

                 For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint  is  un-
                 healthy,  Route  53  looks  for a resource record set for the
                 larger, associated geographic region.  For  example,  suppose
                 you  have  resource  record  sets  for  a state in the United
                 States, for the entire United States, for North America,  and
                 a resource record set that has * for CountryCode is * , which
                 applies to all locations. If the endpoint for the  state  re-
                 source  record  set is unhealthy, Route 53 checks for healthy
                 resource record sets in the following order until it finds  a
                 resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy:

                 o The United States

                 o North America

                 o The default resource record set
                     Specifying the Health Check Endpoint by Domain Name

                 If  your  health  checks  specify the endpoint only by domain
                 name, we recommend that you create a  separate  health  check
                 for  each  endpoint.  For  example, create a health check for
                 each HTTP server that is serving content for  www.example.com
                 . For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName , specify the do-
                 main name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com ),
                 not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com ).

                 WARNING:
                     Health  check results will be unpredictable if you do the
                     following:

                     o Create a health check that has the same value for  Ful-
                       lyQualifiedDomainName  as the name of a resource record
                       set.

                     o Associate that health check with  the  resource  record
                       set.

              TrafficPolicyInstanceId -> (string)
                 When  you  create  a traffic policy instance, Amazon Route 53
                 automatically creates a resource record set. TrafficPolicyIn-
                 stanceId  is the ID of the traffic policy instance that Route
                 53 created this resource record set for.

                 WARNING:
                     To delete the resource record set that is associated with
                     a  traffic  policy  instance,  use DeleteTrafficPolicyIn-
                     stance . Route 53 will delete the resource record set au-
                     tomatically. If you delete the resource record set by us-
                     ing ChangeResourceRecordSets , Route 53 doesn't automati-
                     cally delete the traffic policy instance, and you'll con-
                     tinue to be charged for it even though it's no longer  in
                     use.

              CidrRoutingConfig -> (structure)
                 The  object  that  is specified in resource record set object
                 when you are linking a resource record set to  a  CIDR  loca-
                 tion.

                 A LocationName with an asterisk * can be used to create a de-
                 fault CIDR record. CollectionId is still required for default
                 record.

                 CollectionId -> (string)
                     The CIDR collection ID.

                 LocationName -> (string)
                     The CIDR collection location name.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether more resource record sets remain to be
          listed. If your results were truncated, you  can  make  a  follow-up
          pagination request by using the NextRecordName element.

       NextRecordName -> (string)
          If  the  results  were truncated, the name of the next record in the
          list.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true.

       NextRecordType -> (string)
          If the results were truncated, the type of the next  record  in  the
          list.

          This element is present only if IsTruncated is true.

       NextRecordIdentifier -> (string)
              Resource  record sets that have a routing policy other than sim-
              ple: If results were truncated for a given DNS  name  and  type,
              the value of SetIdentifier for the next resource record set that
              has the current DNS name and type.

          For information about routing policies, see Choosing a Routing  Pol-
          icy in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The maximum number of records you requested.
