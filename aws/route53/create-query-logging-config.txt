CREATE-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIG()                    CREATE-QUERY-LOGGING-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-query-logging-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a configuration for DNS query logging. After you create a query
       logging configuration, Amazon Route 53 begins to publish log data to an
       Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group.

       DNS  query logs contain information about the queries that Route 53 re-
       ceives for a specified public hosted zone, such as the following:

       o Route 53 edge location that responded to the DNS query

       o Domain or subdomain that was requested

       o DNS record type, such as A or AAAA

       o DNS response code, such as NoError or ServFail

         Log Group and Resource Policy

       Before you create a query logging configuration, perform the  following
       operations.

       NOTE:
          If  you create a query logging configuration using the Route 53 con-
          sole, Route 53 performs these operations automatically.

       o Create a CloudWatch Logs log group, and make note of the  ARN,  which
         you  specify  when you create a query logging configuration. Note the
         following:

         o You must create the log group in the us-east-1 region.

         o You must use the same Amazon Web Services account to create the log
           group  and the hosted zone that you want to configure query logging
           for.

         o When you create log groups for query logging, we recommend that you
           use a consistent prefix, for example:
           ``
           /aws/route53/hosted  zone name ``   In the next step, you'll create
           a resource policy, which controls access to one or more log  groups
           and  the associated Amazon Web Services resources, such as Route 53
           hosted zones. There's a limit on the number  of  resource  policies
           that you can create, so we recommend that you use a consistent pre-
           fix so you can use the same resource policy for all the log  groups
           that you create for query logging.

       o Create a CloudWatch Logs resource policy, and give it the permissions
         that Route 53 needs to create log streams and to send query  logs  to
         log  streams. For the value of Resource , specify the ARN for the log
         group that you created in the previous step. To use the same resource
         policy  for  all  the CloudWatch Logs log groups that you created for
         query logging configurations, replace the hosted zone name with  *  ,
         for                                                          example:
         arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:123412341234:log-group:/aws/route53/*

       NOTE:
              You can't use the CloudWatch console to create  or  edit  a  re-
              source  policy. You must use the CloudWatch API, one of the Ama-
              zon Web Services SDKs, or the CLI.

          Log Streams and Edge Locations

       When Route 53 finishes creating the configuration for  DNS  query  log-
       ging, it does the following:

       o Creates  a  log  stream  for an edge location the first time that the
         edge location responds to DNS queries for the specified hosted  zone.
         That  log stream is used to log all queries that Route 53 responds to
         for that edge location.

       o Begins to send query logs to the applicable log stream.

       The name of each log stream is in the following format:
          `` hosted zone ID /edge location code ``

       The edge location code is a three-letter code and  an  arbitrarily  as-
       signed  number, for example, DFW3. The three-letter code typically cor-
       responds with the International Air Transport Association airport  code
       for  an  airport  near  the  edge  location. (These abbreviations might
       change in the future.) For a list of edge locations, see "The Route  53
       Global Network" on the Route 53 Product Details page.
          Queries That Are Logged

       Query logs contain only the queries that DNS resolvers forward to Route
       53. If a DNS resolver has already cached the response to a query  (such
       as  the  IP  address for a load balancer for example.com), the resolver
       will continue to return the cached response. It doesn't forward another
       query  to  Route 53 until the TTL for the corresponding resource record
       set expires. Depending on how many DNS queries are submitted for a  re-
       source  record  set,  and depending on the TTL for that resource record
       set, query logs might contain information about only one query  out  of
       every  several thousand queries that are submitted to DNS. For more in-
       formation about how DNS works, see Routing  Internet  Traffic  to  Your
       Website or Web Application in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Log File Format

       For  a  list  of  the  values  in each query log and the format of each
       value, see Logging DNS Queries in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       For information about charges for query  logs,  see  Amazon  CloudWatch
       Pricing .
          How to Stop Logging

       If  you  want  Route  53 to stop sending query logs to CloudWatch Logs,
       delete the query  logging  configuration.  For  more  information,  see
       DeleteQueryLoggingConfig .

SYNOPSIS
            create-query-logging-config
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The  ID of the hosted zone that you want to log queries for. You can
          log queries only for public hosted zones.

       --cloud-watch-logs-log-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the log group that  you  want  to
          Amazon  Route  53  to  send query logs to. This is the format of the
          ARN:

          arn:aws:logs:region :account-id :log-group:log_group_name

          To get the ARN for a log group, you can use the CloudWatch  console,
          the  DescribeLogGroups  API action, the describe-log-groups command,
          or the applicable command in one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          query logs to.

          Id -> (string)

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the CloudWatch Logs log  group
