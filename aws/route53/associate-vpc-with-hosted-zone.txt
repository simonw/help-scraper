ASSOCIATE-VPC-WITH-HOSTED-ZONE()              ASSOCIATE-VPC-WITH-HOSTED-ZONE()



NAME
       associate-vpc-with-hosted-zone -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates an Amazon VPC with a private hosted zone.

       WARNING:
          To perform the association, the VPC and the private hosted zone must
          already exist. You can't convert a public hosted zone into a private
          hosted zone.

       NOTE:
          If  you want to associate a VPC that was created by using one Amazon
          Web Services account with a private hosted zone that was created  by
          using a different account, the Amazon Web Services account that cre-
          ated the private hosted zone must first submit  a  CreateVPCAssocia-
          tionAuthorization  request.  Then  the  account that created the VPC
          must submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request.

OPTIONS
       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The ID of the private hosted zone that you want to associate an Ama-
          zon VPC with.

          Note  that you can't associate a VPC with a hosted zone that doesn't
          have an existing VPC association.

       --vpc (structure)
          A complex type that contains information about the VPC that you want
          to associate with a private hosted zone.

          VPCRegion -> (string)
              (Private  hosted  zones  only) The region that an Amazon VPC was
              created in.

          VPCId -> (string)
              (Private hosted zones only) The ID of an Amazon VPC.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          VPCRegion=string,VPCId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "VPCRegion": "us-east-1"|"us-east-2"|"us-west-1"|"us-west-2"|"eu-west-1"|"eu-west-2"|"eu-west-3"|"eu-central-1"|"ap-east-1"|"me-south-1"|"us-gov-west-1"|"us-gov-east-1"|"us-iso-east-1"|"us-iso-west-1"|"us-isob-east-1"|"ap-southeast-1"|"ap-southeast-2"|"ap-southeast-3"|"ap-south-1"|"ap-northeast-1"|"ap-northeast-2"|"ap-northeast-3"|"eu-north-1"|"sa-east-1"|"ca-central-1"|"cn-north-1"|"af-south-1"|"eu-south-1",

          }

       --comment (string)
          Optional: A comment about the association request.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
