SYNOPSIS
            list-traffic-policies
          [--traffic-policy-id-marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --traffic-policy-id-marker (string)
          (Conditional) For your first request to ListTrafficPolicies ,  don't
          include the TrafficPolicyIdMarker parameter.

          If you have more traffic policies than the value of MaxItems , List-
          TrafficPolicies returns only the first MaxItems traffic policies. To
          get  the next group of policies, submit another request to ListTraf-
          ficPolicies . For the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker ,  specify  the
          value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker that was returned in the previous re-
          sponse.

       --max-items (string)
          (Optional) The maximum number of traffic policies that you want Ama-
          zon Route 53 to return in response to this request. If you have more
          than MaxItems traffic policies, the value of IsTruncated in the  re-
          sponse is true , and the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the ID of
          the first traffic policy that Route 53 will return if you submit an-
          other request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TrafficPolicySummaries -> (list)
          A list that contains one TrafficPolicySummary element for each traf-
          fic  policy  that was created by the current Amazon Web Services ac-
          count.

              A complex type that contains information about the  latest  ver-
              sion  of  one traffic policy that is associated with the current
              Amazon Web Services account.

              Id -> (string)
                 The ID that Amazon Route 53 assigned to  the  traffic  policy
                 when you created it.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  that you specified for the traffic policy when you
                 created it.

              Type -> (string)
                 The DNS type of the resource record sets that Amazon Route 53
                 creates  when  you  use  a traffic policy to create a traffic
                 policy instance.

              LatestVersion -> (integer)
                 The version number of the latest version of the traffic  pol-
                 icy.

              TrafficPolicyCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of traffic policies that are associated with the
                 current Amazon Web Services account.

       IsTruncated -> (boolean)
          A flag that indicates whether there are more traffic policies to  be
          listed. If the response was truncated, you can get the next group of
          traffic policies by submitting another  ListTrafficPolicies  request
          and specifying the value of TrafficPolicyIdMarker in the TrafficPol-
          icyIdMarker request parameter.

       TrafficPolicyIdMarker -> (string)
          If the value of IsTruncated is true , TrafficPolicyIdMarker  is  the
          ID of the first traffic policy in the next group of MaxItems traffic
          policies.

       MaxItems -> (string)
          The value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the List-
          TrafficPolicies request that produced the current response.
