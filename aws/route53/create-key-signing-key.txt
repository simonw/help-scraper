CREATE-KEY-SIGNING-KEY()                              CREATE-KEY-SIGNING-KEY()



NAME
       create-key-signing-key -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new key-signing key (KSK) associated with a hosted zone. You
       can only have two KSKs per hosted zone.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-key-signing-key
          --caller-reference <value>
          --hosted-zone-id <value>
          --key-management-service-arn <value>
          --name <value>
          --status <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --caller-reference (string)
          A unique string that identifies the request.

       --hosted-zone-id (string)
          The unique string (ID) used to identify a hosted zone.

       --key-management-service-arn (string)
          The Amazon resource name (ARN) for a customer  managed  key  in  Key
          Management Service (KMS). The KeyManagementServiceArn must be unique
          for each key-signing key (KSK) in a single hosted zone.  To  see  an
          example  of  KeyManagementServiceArn that grants the correct permis-
          sions for DNSSEC, scroll down to Example .

          You must configure the customer managed customer managed key as fol-
          lows:
              Status

          Enabled
              Key spec

          ECC_NIST_P256
              Key usage

          Sign and verify
              Key policy

          The key policy must give permission for the following actions:

          o DescribeKey

          o GetPublicKey

          o Sign

          The  key policy must also include the Amazon Route 53 service in the
          principal for your account. Specify the following:

          o "Service": "dnssec-route53.amazonaws.com"

          For more information about working with a customer  managed  key  in
          KMS, see Key Management Service concepts .

       --name (string)
          A  string used to identify a key-signing key (KSK). Name can include
          numbers, letters, and underscores (_). Name must be unique for  each
          key-signing key in the same hosted zone.

       --status (string)
          A string specifying the initial status of the key-signing key (KSK).
          You can set the value to ACTIVE or INACTIVE .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ChangeInfo -> (structure)
          A complex type that describes change information about changes  made
          to your hosted zone.

          Id -> (string)
              This  element  contains  an  ID  that  you use when performing a
              GetChange action to get detailed information about the change.

          Status -> (string)
              The current state of the request. PENDING  indicates  that  this
              request  has  not  yet  been  applied to all Amazon Route 53 DNS
              servers.

          SubmittedAt -> (timestamp)

              8601  format  and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example,
              the value 2017-03-27T17:48:16.751Z represents March 27, 2017  at

              o DescribeKey

              o GetPublicKey

              o Sign

              The  key policy must also include the Amazon Route 53 service in
              the principal for your account. Specify the following:

              o "Service": "dnssec-route53.amazonaws.com"

              For more information about working with the customer managed key
              in KMS, see Key Management Service concepts .

          Flag -> (integer)
              An  integer  that specifies how the key is used. For key-signing
              key (KSK), this value is always 257.

          SigningAlgorithmMnemonic -> (string)
              A string used to represent the  signing  algorithm.  This  value
              must follow the guidelines provided by RFC-8624 Section 3.1 .

          SigningAlgorithmType -> (integer)
              An  integer  used to represent the signing algorithm. This value
              must follow the guidelines provided by RFC-8624 Section 3.1 .

          DigestAlgorithmMnemonic -> (string)
              A string used to represent the delegation  signer  digest  algo-
              rithm.  This  value  must  follow  the  guidelines  provided  by
              RFC-8624 Section 3.3 .

          DigestAlgorithmType -> (integer)
              An integer used to represent the delegation signer digest  algo-
              rithm.  This  value  must  follow  the  guidelines  provided  by
              RFC-8624 Section 3.3 .

          KeyTag -> (integer)
              An integer used to identify the DNSSEC  record  for  the  domain
              name.  The  process  used to calculate the value is described in
              RFC-4034 Appendix B .

          DigestValue -> (string)
              A cryptographic digest of a DNSKEY resource record (RR).  DNSKEY
              records  are  used  to publish the public key that resolvers can
              use to verify DNSSEC signatures that are used to secure  certain
              kinds of information provided by the DNS system.

          PublicKey -> (string)
              The public key, represented as a Base64 encoding, as required by
              RFC-4034 Page 5 .

          DSRecord -> (string)
              A string that represents a delegation signer (DS) record.

          DNSKEYRecord -> (string)
              A string that represents a DNSKEY record.

          Status -> (string)
              A string that represents the current key-signing key (KSK)  sta-
              tus.

              Status can have one of the following values:
                 ACTIVE

              The KSK is being used for signing.
                 INACTIVE

              The KSK is not being used for signing.
                 DELETING

              The KSK is in the process of being deleted.
                 ACTION_NEEDED

              There is a problem with the KSK that requires you to take action
              to resolve. For example, the customer  managed  key  might  have
              been  deleted,  or  the permissions for the customer managed key
              might have been changed.
                 INTERNAL_FAILURE

              There was an error during a request. Before you can continue  to
              work  with  DNSSEC  signing, including actions that involve this
              KSK, you must correct the problem. For example, you may need  to
              activate or deactivate the KSK.

          StatusMessage -> (string)
              The  status  message  provided for the following key-signing key
              (KSK) statuses: ACTION_NEEDED or INTERNAL_FAILURE .  The  status
              message includes information about what the problem might be and
              steps that you can take to correct the issue.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date when the key-signing key (KSK) was created.

          LastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
              The last time that the key-signing key (KSK) was changed.

       Location -> (string)
          The unique URL representing the new key-signing key (KSK).
