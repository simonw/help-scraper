NAME
       get-traffic-policy-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a specified traffic policy instance.

       NOTE:
          After  you  submit  a  CreateTrafficPolicyInstance or an UpdateTraf-
          ficPolicyInstance request, there's a brief delay while Amazon  Route
          53  creates the resource record sets that are specified in the traf-
          fic policy definition. For more information, see the State  response
          element.

       NOTE:
          In  the Route 53 console, traffic policy instances are known as pol-
          icy records.

SYNOPSIS
            get-traffic-policy-instance
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the traffic policy instance that you want to get  informa-
          tion about.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
