LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()                            LIST-CLUSTER-OPERATIONS()



NAME
       list-cluster-operations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of all the operations that have been performed on the
       specified MSK cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-cluster-operations is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ClusterOperationInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-cluster-operations
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            TLS means that client-broker communication is  en-
                            abled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT  means that client-broker communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as
                            plaintext data.

                            PLAINTEXT  means  that client-broker communication
                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                        InCluster -> (boolean)

                            encrypted. When set to  false,  the  communication
                            happens in plaintext.

                        Type -> (string)

                            turned off. SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS  indicates  that
                            public access is turned on.

                            the possible values.

                            TLS means that client-broker communication is  en-
                            abled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT  means that client-broker communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as
                            plaintext data.

                            PLAINTEXT  means  that client-broker communication
                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                        InCluster -> (boolean)
                            When set to true, it indicates that data  communi-
                            cation  among  the  broker nodes of the cluster is
                            encrypted. When set to  false,  the  communication
                            happens in plaintext.

                            The default value is true.

                 ConnectivityInfo -> (structure)
                     Information about the broker access configuration.

                     PublicAccess -> (structure)
                        Public access control for brokers.

                        Type -> (string)
                            The value DISABLED indicates that public access is
                            turned off. SERVICE_PROVIDED_EIPS  indicates  that
                            public access is turned on.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the response of ListClusterOperations is truncated, it returns a
          NextToken in the response. This Nexttoken should be sent in the sub-
          sequent request to ListClusterOperations.
