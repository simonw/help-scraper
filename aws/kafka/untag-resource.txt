NAME
       untag-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the  tags  associated  with  the keys that are provided in the
       query.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            untag-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tag-keys <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the resource
          that's associated with the tags.

       --tag-keys (list)
          Tag  keys  must be unique for a given cluster. In addition, the fol-
          lowing restrictions apply:

          o Each tag key must be unique. If you add a tag with  a  key  that's
            already  in  use,  your  new tag overwrites the existing key-value
            pair.

          o You can't start a tag key with aws: because  this  prefix  is  re-
            served  for use by AWS. AWS creates tags that begin with this pre-
            fix on your behalf, but you can't edit or delete them.

          o Tag keys must be between 1 and 128 Unicode characters in length.

          o Tag keys must consist of the following  characters:  Unicode  let-
            ters, digits, white space, and the following special characters: _
            . / = + - @.
              (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
