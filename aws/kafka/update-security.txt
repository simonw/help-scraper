       Shorthand Syntax:

          Sasl={Scram={Enabled=boolean},Iam={Enabled=boolean}},Tls={CertificateAuthorityArnList=[string,string],Enabled=boolean},Unauthenticated={Enabled=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Sasl": {
              "Scram": {
                "Enabled": true|false
              },
              "Iam": {
                "Enabled": true|false
              }
            },
            "Tls": {
              "CertificateAuthorityArnList": ["string", ...],
              "Enabled": true|false
            },
            "Unauthenticated": {
              "Enabled": true|false
            }
          }

       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --current-version (string)
          The  version  of  the MSK cluster to update. Cluster versions aren't
          simple numbers. You can describe an MSK cluster to find its version.
          When this update operation is successful, it generates a new cluster
          version.

       --encryption-info (structure)
          Includes all encryption-related information.
              EncryptionAtRest -> (structure)
                 The data-volume encryption details.

                 DataVolumeKMSKeyId -> (string)
                     The ARN of the AWS KMS key for encrypting data  at  rest.
                     If  you  don't specify a KMS key, MSK creates one for you
                     and uses it.

          EncryptionInTransit -> (structure)
              The details for encryption in transit.

              ClientBroker -> (string)
                 Indicates the encryption setting for data in transit  between
                 clients and brokers. The following are the possible values.

                 TLS  means  that  client-broker communication is enabled with
                 TLS only.

                 TLS_PLAINTEXT means that client-broker communication  is  en-
                 abled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as plaintext data.

                 PLAINTEXT  means  that client-broker communication is enabled
                 in plaintext only.

                 The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

              InCluster -> (boolean)
                 When set to true, it indicates that data communication  among
                 the  broker  nodes  of  the cluster is encrypted. When set to
                 false, the communication happens in plaintext.

                 The default value is true.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EncryptionAtRest={DataVolumeKMSKeyId=string},EncryptionInTransit={ClientBroker=string,InCluster=boolean}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EncryptionAtRest": {
              "DataVolumeKMSKeyId": "string"
            },
            "EncryptionInTransit": {
              "ClientBroker": "TLS"|"TLS_PLAINTEXT"|"PLAINTEXT",
              "InCluster": true|false
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ClusterArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster.

       ClusterOperationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the cluster operation.
