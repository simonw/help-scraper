SYNOPSIS
            describe-cluster
          --cluster-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       ClusterInfo -> (structure)
          The cluster information.

          ActiveOperationArn -> (string)
              Arn of active cluster operation.

          BrokerNodeGroupInfo -> (structure)
              Information about the broker nodes.

              BrokerAZDistribution -> (string)
                 The  distribution  of broker nodes across Availability Zones.
                 This is an optional parameter. If you don't specify it,  Ama-
                 zon  MSK  gives it the value DEFAULT. You can also explicitly
                 set this parameter to the value DEFAULT. No other values  are
                 currently allowed.

                 Amazon  MSK  distributes  the  broker nodes evenly across the
                 Availability Zones that correspond to the subnets you provide
                 when you create the cluster.

              ClientSubnets -> (list)
                 The  list of subnets to connect to in the client virtual pri-
                 vate cloud (VPC). AWS creates elastic network interfaces  in-
                 side  these  subnets. Client applications use elastic network
                 interfaces to produce and consume data. Client subnets  can't
                 occupy the Availability Zone with ID use use1-az3.

                 (string)

              InstanceType -> (string)
                 The type of Amazon EC2 instances to use for Apache Kafka bro-
                 kers.   The   following   instance   types    are    allowed:
                 kafka.m5.large,       kafka.m5.xlarge,      kafka.m5.2xlarge,
                 kafka.m5.4xlarge, kafka.m5.12xlarge, and kafka.m5.24xlarge.

              SecurityGroups -> (list)
                 The AWS security groups to associate with the elastic network
                 interfaces  in order to specify who can connect to and commu-
                 nicate with the Amazon MSK cluster. If you  don't  specify  a
                 security  group,  Amazon  MSK uses the default security group
                 associated with the VPC.

                     values.

                     TLS  means  that  client-broker  communication is enabled
                     with TLS only.

                     enabled  for  both  TLS-encrypted,  as  well as plaintext
                     data.
