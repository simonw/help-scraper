LIST-CLUSTERS-V2()                                          LIST-CLUSTERS-V2()



NAME
       list-clusters-v2 -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the MSK clusters in the current Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-clusters-v2  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ClusterInfoList

SYNOPSIS
            list-clusters-v2
          [--cluster-name-filter <value>]
          [--cluster-type-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name-filter (string)
          Specify a prefix of the names of the clusters that you want to list.
          The  service lists all the clusters whose names start with this pre-
          fix.

       --cluster-type-filter (string)
          Specify either PROVISIONED or SERVERLESS.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     Information about the brokers.

                     BrokerAZDistribution -> (string)
                        The  distribution  of broker nodes across Availability
                        Zones. This is an optional  parameter.  If  you  don't
                        specify it, Amazon MSK gives it the value DEFAULT. You
                        can also explicitly set this parameter  to  the  value
                        DEFAULT. No other values are currently allowed.

                        Amazon  MSK distributes the broker nodes evenly across
                        the Availability Zones that correspond to the  subnets
                        you provide when you create the cluster.

                        tual private cloud (VPC). AWS creates elastic  network
                        interfaces  inside  these subnets. Client applications
                        use elastic network interfaces to produce and  consume
                        data.  Client  subnets  can't  be in Availability Zone
                        us-east-1e.

                        kafka.m5.2xlarge, kafka.m5.4xlarge, kafka.m5.12xlarge,

                        to and communicate with the Amazon MSK cluster. If you
                        don't  specify  a  security group, Amazon MSK uses the
                        default security group associated with the VPC.

                            TLS means that client-broker communication is  en-
                            abled with TLS only.

                            TLS_PLAINTEXT  means that client-broker communica-
                            tion is enabled for both TLS-encrypted, as well as

                            is enabled in plaintext only.

                            The default value is TLS_PLAINTEXT.

                        InCluster -> (boolean)

                            encrypted. When set to  false,  the  communication
                            happens in plaintext.
