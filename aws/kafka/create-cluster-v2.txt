OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster.

       --tags (map)
          A map of tags that you want the cluster to have.
              key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --provisioned (structure)
          Information about the provisioned cluster.
              BrokerNodeGroupInfo -> (structure)
                 Information about the brokers.

                 BrokerAZDistribution -> (string)
                     The  distribution  of  broker  nodes  across Availability
                     Zones. This is an optional parameter. If you don't  spec-
                     ify  it,  Amazon  MSK gives it the value DEFAULT. You can
                     also explicitly set this parameter to the value  DEFAULT.
                     No other values are currently allowed.

                     Amazon MSK distributes the broker nodes evenly across the
                     Availability Zones that correspond  to  the  subnets  you
                     provide when you create the cluster.

                 ClientSubnets -> (list)
                     The  list  of subnets to connect to in the client virtual
                     private cloud (VPC). AWS creates elastic  network  inter-
                     faces inside these subnets. Client applications use elas-
                     tic network  interfaces  to  produce  and  consume  data.
                     Client subnets can't occupy the Availability Zone with ID
                     use use1-az3.

                     network interfaces in order to specify who can connect to
                     and communicate with the Amazon MSK cluster. If you don't
                     specify a security group, Amazon MSK uses the default se-
                     curity group associated with the VPC.

                     values.

                     TLS  means  that  client-broker  communication is enabled
                     with TLS only.

                     enabled  for  both  TLS-encrypted,  as  well as plaintext
                     data.

                     PLAINTEXT means that client-broker communication  is  en-
                     abled in plaintext only.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
