DESCRIPTION
       Gets  recommendations  about  architecture  designs  for  improving re-

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-architecture-recommendations
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          --recovery-group-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The number of objects that you want to return with this call.

       --next-token (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       --recovery-group-name (string)
          The name of a recovery group.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LastAuditTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The  time  that  a  recovery group was last assessed for recommenda-
          tions, in UTC ISO-8601 format.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       Recommendations -> (list)
          A list of the recommendations for the customer's application.

          (structure)
              Recommendations that are provided to make  an  application  more
              recovery resilient.

              RecommendationText -> (string)
                 Text  of the recommendations that are provided to make an ap-
                 plication more recovery resilient.
