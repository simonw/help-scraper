GET-CELL-READINESS-SUMMARY()                      GET-CELL-READINESS-SUMMARY()



NAME
       get-cell-readiness-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  readiness  for  a  cell.  Aggregates the readiness of all the re-
       sources that are associated with the cell into a single value.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-cell-readiness-summary is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: ReadinessChecks

SYNOPSIS
            get-cell-readiness-summary
          --cell-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cell-name (string)
          The name of the cell.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token that identifies which batch of results you want to see.

       Readiness -> (string)
          The readiness at a cell level.

       ReadinessChecks -> (list)
          Summaries for the readiness checks that make up the cell.

          (structure)
              Summary  of  all  readiness  check statuses in a recovery group,
              paginated in GetRecoveryGroupReadinessSummary and  GetCellReadi-
              nessSummary.

              Readiness -> (string)
                 The readiness status of this readiness check.

              ReadinessCheckName -> (string)
                 The name of a readiness check.
