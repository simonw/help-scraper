INVOKE-ENDPOINT-ASYNC()                                INVOKE-ENDPOINT-ASYNC()



NAME
       invoke-endpoint-async -

DESCRIPTION
       After you deploy a model into production using Amazon SageMaker hosting
       services, your client applications use this API to get inferences  from
       the model hosted at the specified endpoint in an asynchronous manner.

       Inference  requests sent to this API are enqueued for asynchronous pro-
       cessing. The processing of the inference request may or  may  not  com-
       plete  before  the  you  receive a response from this API. The response
       from this API will not contain the result of the inference request  but
       contain information about where you can locate it.

       Amazon  SageMaker strips all POST headers except those supported by the
       API. Amazon SageMaker might add additional headers. You should not rely
       on the behavior of headers outside those enumerated in the request syn-
       tax.

       Calls to InvokeEndpointAsync are authenticated by using Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Signature Version 4. For information, see Authenticating Requests
       (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) in the Amazon S3  API  Refer-
       ence .

SYNOPSIS
            invoke-endpoint-async
          --endpoint-name <value>
          [--content-type <value>]
          [--accept <value>]
          [--custom-attributes <value>]
          [--inference-id <value>]
          --input-location <value>
          [--request-ttl-seconds <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  endpoint that you specified when you created the
          endpoint         using         the         `          CreateEndpoint
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateEndpoint.html`__
          API.

       --content-type (string)
          The MIME type of the input data in the request body.

       --accept (string)
          The desired MIME type of the inference in the response.

       --custom-attributes (string)
          Provides additional information about a  request  for  an  inference
          submitted to a model hosted at an Amazon SageMaker endpoint. The in-
          formation is an opaque value that is forwarded verbatim.  You  could
          use  this  value,  for example, to provide an ID that you can use to
          track a request or to provide other metadata that a service endpoint
          was  programmed  to  process. The value must consist of no more than
          1024 visible US-ASCII characters  as  specified  in  Section  3.3.6.
          Field   Value   Components   of   the  Hypertext  Transfer  Protocol
          (HTTP/1.1).

          The code in your model is responsible for setting  or  updating  any
          custom  attributes  in  the response. If your code does not set this
          value in the response, an empty value is returned. For example, if a
          custom attribute represents the trace ID, your model can prepend the
          custom attribute with Trace ID : in your post-processing function.

          This feature is currently supported in the Amazon Web Services  SDKs
          but not in the Amazon SageMaker Python SDK.

       --inference-id (string)
          The identifier for the inference request. Amazon SageMaker will gen-
          erate an identifier for you if none is specified.

       --input-location (string)
          The Amazon S3 URI where the inference request payload is stored.

       --request-ttl-seconds (integer)
          Maximum age in seconds a request can be in the queue  before  it  is
          marked as expired.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InferenceId -> (string)
          Identifier for an inference request. This will be the  same  as  the
          InferenceId  specified  in the input. Amazon SageMaker will generate
          an identifier for you if you do not specify one.

       OutputLocation -> (string)
          The Amazon S3 URI where the inference response payload is stored.
