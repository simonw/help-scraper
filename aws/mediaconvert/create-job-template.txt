OPTIONS
       --acceleration-settings (structure) Accelerated transcoding can signif-
       icantly speed up jobs with long, visually complex content. Outputs that
       use  this feature incur pro-tier pricing. For information about feature
       limitations, see the AWS  Elemental  MediaConvert  User  Guide.Mode  ->
       (string)
          Specify  the  conditions when the service will run your job with ac-
          celerated transcoding.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Mode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Mode": "DISABLED"|"ENABLED"|"PREFERRED"
          }

       --category (string) Optional. A category for the job template  you  are
       creating

       --description  (string) Optional. A description of the job template you
       are creating.

       --hop-destinations (list) Optional. Use queue hopping to  avoid  overly
       long  waits  in  the  backlog of the queue that you submit your job to.
       Specify an alternate queue and the maximum time that your job will wait
       in  the  initial  queue before hopping. For more information about this
       feature, see the AWS Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.(structure)
          Optional. Configuration for a destination queue to which the job can
          hop once a customer-defined minimum wait time has passed.

          Priority -> (integer)
              Optional.  When  you  set up a job to use queue hopping, you can
              specify a different relative priority for the job in the  desti-
              nation  queue.  If you don't specify, the relative priority will
              remain the same as in the previous queue.

          Queue -> (string)
              Optional unless the job is submitted on the default queue.  When
              you  set up a job to use queue hopping, you can specify a desti-
              nation queue. This queue cannot be the original queue  to  which
              the  job  is  submitted. If the original queue isn't the default
              queue and you don't specify the destination queue, the job  will
              move to the default queue.

          WaitMinutes -> (integer)
              Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Minimum wait
              time in minutes until the job can hop to the destination  queue.
              Valid range is 1 to 1440 minutes, inclusive.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Priority=integer,Queue=string,WaitMinutes=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Priority": integer,
              "Queue": "string",
              "WaitMinutes": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string) The name of the job template you are creating.

       --priority (integer) Specify the relative priority for this job. In any
       given queue, the service begins processing the  job  with  the  highest
       value  first. When more than one job has the same priority, the service
       begins processing the job that you submitted first. If you don't  spec-
       ify a priority, the service uses the default value 0.

       --queue  (string)  Optional. The queue that jobs created from this tem-
       plate are assigned to. If you don't specify this, jobs will go  to  the
       default queue.

       --settings  (structure)  JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode
       settings saved in the template that will be  applied  to  jobs  created
       from it.AdAvailOffset -> (integer)
              When  specified,  this  offset (in milliseconds) is added to the
              input Ad Avail PTS time.

          AvailBlanking -> (structure)
              Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or overlaid
              with  an  image,  and  audio  muted  during SCTE-35 triggered ad
              avails.

              AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                 Blanking image to be used. Leave empty for solid black.  Only
                 bmp and png images are supported.

          Esam -> (structure)
              Settings  for Event Signaling And Messaging (ESAM). If you don't
              do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

              ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                 Specifies an ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification XML as
                 per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the mani-
                 fest conditioning instructions that you provide in  the  set-
                 ting MCC XML (mccXml).

                 MccXml -> (string)
                     Provide  your  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML document inside your JSON job settings. Form the  XML
                     document as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder
                     will use the Manifest Conditioning  instructions  in  the
                     message that you supply.

              ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  stream distance, in milliseconds, between the
                 SCTE 35 messages that the transcoder places  and  the  splice
                 points  that  they refer to. If the time between the start of
                 the asset and the SCTE-35 message is less  than  this  value,
                 then  the  transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker at the begin-
                 ning of the stream.

              SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                 Specifies an ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML  as  per
                 OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.  The  transcoder  uses  the signal
                 processing instructions that you provide in the  setting  SCC
                 XML (sccXml).

                 SccXml -> (string)
                     Provide  your ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML docu-
                     ment inside your JSON job settings. Form the XML document
                     as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder will use
                     the signal processing instructions in  the  message  that
                     you  supply.  Provide your ESAM SignalProcessingNotifica-
                     tion XML document inside your JSON job settings. For your
                     MPEG2-TS  file  outputs, if you want the service to place
                     SCTE-35 markers at the insertion points  you  specify  in
                     the  XML  document,  you  must  also  enable SCTE-35 ESAM
                     (scte35Esam). Note that you can either  specify  an  ESAM
                     XML  document or enable SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do
                     both.

          ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
              If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services, enable
              this feature to specify what MediaConvert does with the Extended
              Data Services (XDS) packets. You can choose to pass through  XDS
              packets,  or  remove  them from the output. For more information
              about XDS, see EIA-608 Line Data Services, section  9.5.1.5  05h
              Content Advisory.

              CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                 The  action  to  take  on copy and redistribution control XDS
                 packets. If you  select  PASSTHROUGH,  packets  will  not  be
                 changed.  If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed in
                 output captions.

              VchipAction -> (string)
                 The action to take on content advisory XDS  packets.  If  you
                 select  PASSTHROUGH,  packets will not be changed. If you se-
                 lect STRIP, any packets will be removed in output captions.

          Inputs -> (list)
              Use Inputs (inputs) to  define  the  source  file  used  in  the
              transcode  job.  There  can only be one input in a job template.
              Using the API, you can include multiple inputs when  referencing
              a job template.

              (structure)
                 Specified video input in a template.

                 AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                     Use audio selector groups to combine multiple sidecar au-
                     dio inputs so that you can assign them to a single output
                     audio  tab (AudioDescription). Note that, if you're work-
                     ing with embedded audio, it's simpler to assign  multiple
                     input tracks into a single audio selector rather than use
                     an audio selector group.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use audio selector groups to combine multiple  sidecar
                        audio  inputs  so that you can assign them to a single
                        output audio tab  (AudioDescription).  Note  that,  if
                        you're  working  with  embedded audio, it's simpler to
                        assign multiple input tracks into a single  audio  se-
                        lector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                            Name of an Audio Selector within the same input to
                            include in the group.  Audio  selector  names  are
                            standardized,  based on their order within the in-
                            put (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio selector
                            name  parameter  can be repeated to add any number
                            of audio selectors to the group.

                            (string)

                 AudioSelectors -> (map)
                     Use Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify  a  track
                     or set of tracks from the input that you will use in your
                     outputs. You can use multiple Audio selectors per input.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify  a
                        track  or  set  of tracks from the input that you will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Selects  a  specific  language code from within an
                            audio source, using the ISO  639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                            three-letter language code

                        DefaultSelection -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting on one audio selector to set
                            it as the default for the job.  The  service  uses
                            this  default  for outputs where it can't find the
                            specified input audio. If you don't set a default,
                            those outputs have no audio.

                        ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                            Specifies audio data from an external file source.

                        HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  specific  to audio sources in an HLS al-
                            ternate rendition group.  Specify  the  properties
                            (renditionGroupId,  renditionName or renditionLan-
                            guageCode) to  identify  the  unique  audio  track
                            among  the alternative rendition groups present in
                            the HLS manifest. If no unique track is found,  or
                            multiple tracks match the properties provided, the
                            job  fails.  If  no  properties  in  hlsRendition-
                            GroupSettings  are  specified,  the  default audio
                            track within the video segment is chosen. If there
                            is  no audio within video segment, the alternative
                            audio with DEFAULT=YES is chosen instead.

                            RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                            RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify ISO 639-2 or ISO  639-3  code
                               in the language property

                            RenditionName -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify media name

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Selects  a  specific  language code from within an
                            audio source.

                        Offset -> (integer)
                            Specifies a time delta in milliseconds  to  offset
                            the audio from the input video.

                        Pids -> (list)
                            Selects a specific PID from within an audio source
                            (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                            (integer)

                        ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                            Use this setting for input  streams  that  contain
                            Dolby E, to have the service extract specific pro-
                            gram data from the track. To select multiple  pro-
                            grams,  create  multiple  selectors  with the same
                            Track and different Program numbers. In  the  con-
                            sole,  this setting is visible when you set Selec-
                            tor type to Track. Choose the program number  from
                            the dropdown list. If you are sending a JSON file,
                            provide the program ID, which is part of the audio
                            metadata.  If  your input file has incorrect meta-
                            data, you can choose All  channels  instead  of  a
                            program number to have the service ignore the pro-
                            gram IDs and  include  all  the  programs  in  the
                            track.

                        RemixSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  these  settings to reorder the audio channels
                            of one input to match those of another input. This
                            allows  you to combine the two files into a single
                            output, one after the other.

                            ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                               Channel mapping (ChannelMapping)  contains  the
                               group  of  fields  that hold the remixing value
                               for each channel, in dB. Specify  remix  values
                               to  indicate  how much of the content from your
                               input audio channel you want in your output au-
                               dio  channels.  Each instance of the InputChan-
                               nels or InputChannelsFineTune  array  specifies
                               these  values  for  one output channel. Use one
                               instance of this array for each output channel.
                               In  the  console,  each  array corresponds to a
                               column in the graphical depiction of  the  map-
                               ping  matrix.  The rows of the graphical matrix
                               correspond to input channels. Valid values  are

                               Specify  the number of audio channels from your
                               input that you want to use in your output. With
                               remixing,  you  might combine or split the data
                               in these channels, so the number of channels in
                               your  final  output  might be different. If you
                               are doing both input channel mapping and output
                               channel  mapping, the number of output channels
                               in your input mapping must be the same  as  the

                        SelectorType -> (string)
                            Specifies the type of the audio selector.

                        Tracks -> (list)
                            Identify a track from the input audio  to  include
                            in  this selector by entering the track index num-

                 CaptionSelectors -> (map)
                     Use captions selectors to specify the captions data  from
                     your  input  that you use in your outputs. You can use up
                     to 20 captions selectors per input.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Use captions selectors to specify  the  captions  data
                        from  your input that you use in your outputs. You can
                        use up to 20 captions selectors per input.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            The specific language to extract from source,  us-

                            field and/or PID to select the caption language to
                            extract. If input is DVB-Sub and output is Burn-in
                            or SMPTE-TT, complete this field and/or PID to se-
                            lect the caption language to extract. If input  is
                            DVB-Sub  that  is  being passed through, omit this
                            field (and PID field); there is no way to  extract
                            a specific language with pass-through captions.

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            The  specific  language to extract from source. If
                            input is SCTE-27, complete this field  and/or  PID
                            to  select the caption language to extract. If in-
                            put is DVB-Sub and output is Burn-in or  SMPTE-TT,
                            complete  this field and/or PID to select the cap-
                            tion language to extract. If input is DVB-Sub that
                            is  being passed through, omit this field (and PID
                            field); there is no way to extract a specific lan-

                        SourceSettings -> (structure)
                            If  your  input  captions are SCC, TTML, STL, SMI,
                            SRT, or IMSC in an xml file, specify  the  URI  of
                            the input captions source file. If your input cap-
                            tions are IMSC in an IMF package, use TrackSource-
                            Settings instead of FileSoureSettings.

                            AncillarySourceSettings -> (structure)

                                   Specify  whether this set of input captions
                                   appears in your outputs in both 608 and 708
                                   format.  If  you  choose  Upconvert (UPCON-

                                   data  in  two  ways: it passes the 608 data
                                   through using the 608  compatibility  bytes
                                   fields  of  the  708  wrapper,  and it also
                                   translates the 608 data into 708.

                                   By default, the service terminates any  un-
                                   terminated  captions at the end of each in-
                                   put. If you want the  caption  to  continue
                                   onto your next input, disable this setting.

                            DvbSubSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               DVB Sub Source Settings

                                   When   using   DVB-Sub   with   Burn-In  or
                                   SMPTE-TT, use this PID for the source  con-
                                   tent.  Unused  for DVB-Sub passthrough. All
                                   DVB-Sub content is passed through,  regard-
                                   less of selectors.

                               Source608ChannelNumber -> (integer)
                                   Specifies the 608/708 channel number within
                                   the  video track from which to extract cap-
                                   tions. Unused for passthrough.

                                   Specifies the video track  index  used  for
                                   extracting  captions.  The system only sup-
                                   ports one input video track, so this should
                                   always be set to '1'.

                                      Specify the numerator  of  the  fraction
                                      that  represents  the frame rate for the
                                      setting Caption source frame rate  (Cap-
                                      tionSourceFramerate).  Use  this setting
                                      along with the setting Framerate denomi-
                                      nator (framerateDenominator).

                               SourceFile -> (string)
                                   External caption file used for loading cap-
                                   tions. Accepted file extensions are  'scc',
                                   'ttml', 'dfxp', 'stl', 'srt', 'xml', 'smi',
                                   'webvtt', and 'vtt'.

                               TimeDelta -> (integer)
                                   Optional. Use this setting when you need to
                                   adjust  the  sync between your sidecar cap-
                                   tions and your video. For more information,
                                   see

                                   Enter a positive or negative number to mod-
                                   ify the times in the captions file. For ex-
                                   ample, type 15 to add 15 seconds to all the
                                   times in the captions file. Type -5 to sub-
                                   tract  5 seconds from the times in the cap-
                                   tions file. You can optionally specify your
                                   time  delta in milliseconds instead of sec-
                                   onds. When you do so, set the related  set-
                                   ting,  Time delta units (TimeDeltaUnits) to
                                   Milliseconds  (MILLISECONDS).  Note   that,
                                   when  you  specify  a  time delta for time-
                                   code-based caption sources, such as SCC and
                                   STL,  and  your time delta isn't a multiple
                                   of the input frame rate, MediaConvert snaps
                                   the  captions to the nearest frame. For ex-
                                   ample, when your input video frame rate  is
                                   25  fps  and  you  specify  1010ms for time
                                   delta, MediaConvert delays your captions by
                                   1000 ms.

                               TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                   When   you   use  the  setting  Time  delta
                                   (TimeDelta) to adjust the sync between your
                                   sidecar  captions  and your video, use this
                                   setting to specify the units for the  delta
                                   that  you specify. When you don't specify a
                                   value for  Time  delta  units  (TimeDeltaU-
                                   nits),  MediaConvert  uses  seconds  by de-
                                   fault.

                            SourceType -> (string)
                               Use Source (SourceType) to identify the  format
                               of  your  input  captions.  The  service cannot
                               auto-detect caption format.

                            TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings specific to Teletext caption  sources,
                               including Page number.

                               PageNumber -> (string)
                                   Use Page Number (PageNumber) to specify the
                                   three-digit hexadecimal  page  number  that
                                   will  be used for Teletext captions. Do not
                                   use this setting if you are passing through
                                   teletext from the input source to output.

                            TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific  to caption sources that are
                               specified by track number. Currently,  this  is
                               only  IMSC  captions in an IMF package. If your
                               caption source is IMSC 1.1 in  a  separate  xml
                               file,  use FileSourceSettings instead of Track-
                               SourceSettings.

                               TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting to select  a  single  cap-
                                   tions  track  from  a source. Track numbers
                                   correspond to the  order  in  the  captions
                                   source file. For IMF sources, track number-
                                   ing is based on the order that the captions
                                   appear  in  the  CPL. For example, use 1 to
                                   select the captions asset  that  is  listed
                                   first  in the CPL. To include more than one
                                   captions track in your job outputs,  create
                                   multiple  input captions selectors. Specify
                                   one track per selector.

                            WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings specific to WebVTT sources in HLS  al-
                               ternative  rendition group. Specify the proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode) to identify the unique subti-
                               tle  track  among  the  alternative   rendition
                               groups  present  in  the  HLS  manifest.  If no
                               unique track is found, or multiple tracks match
                               the  specified  properties,  the  job fails. If
                               there is only one subtitle track in the  rendi-
                               tion  group, the settings can be left empty and
                               the default subtitle track will be  chosen.  If
                               your  caption  source  is  a  sidecar file, use
                               FileSourceSettings instead of  WebvttHlsSource-
                               Settings.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Specify  ISO  639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                 Crop -> (structure)
                     Use Cropping selection (crop) to specify the  video  area
                     that  the service will include in the output video frame.
                     If you specify a value here, it will override  any  value
                     that you specify in the output setting Cropping selection
                     (crop).

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even  num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left  edge  of the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                 DeblockFilter -> (string)
                     Enable Deblock (InputDeblockFilter) to  produce  smoother
                     motion  in the output. Default is disabled. Only manually
                     controllable for MPEG2 and uncompressed video inputs.

                 DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                     Enable Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) to filter noise  from
                     the input. Default is disabled. Only applicable to MPEG2,
                     H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                 FilterEnable -> (string)
                     Specify how the transcoding service applies  the  denoise
                     and  deblock  filters.  You  must also enable the filters
                     separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter) and Deblock
                     (InputDeblockFilter).  *  Auto  - The transcoding service
                     determines whether to apply filtering, depending on input
                     type  and quality. * Disable - The input is not filtered.
                     This is true even if you use the API to  enable  them  in
                     (InputDeblockFilter)  and (InputDeblockFilter). * Force -
                     The input is filtered regardless of input type.

                 FilterStrength -> (integer)
                     Use Filter strength (FilterStrength) to adjust the magni-
                     tude the input filter settings (Deblock and Denoise). The
                     range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                 ImageInserter -> (structure)
                     Enable the image inserter feature to  include  a  graphic
                     overlay on your video. Enable or disable this feature for
                     each input individually. This setting is disabled by  de-
                     fault.

                     InsertableImages -> (list)
                        Specify  the  images  that you want to overlay on your
                        video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                        (structure)
                            These settings apply to a specific  graphic  over-
                            lay.  You  can  include  multiple overlays in your
                            job.

                            Duration -> (integer)
                               Specify the time, in milliseconds, for the  im-
                               age  to  remain on the output video. This dura-
                               tion includes fade-in  time  but  not  fade-out
                               time.

                            FadeIn -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length  of time, in milliseconds,
                               between the Start time that you specify for the
                               image insertion and the time that the image ap-
                               pears at full  opacity.  Full  opacity  is  the
                               level that you specify for the opacity setting.
                               If you don't specify a value for  Fade-in,  the
                               image will appear abruptly at the overlay start
                               time.

                            FadeOut -> (integer)
                               Specify the length of  time,  in  milliseconds,
                               between the end of the time that you have spec-
                               ified for the image overlay Duration  and  when
                               the overlaid image has faded to total transpar-
                               ency.  If  you  don't  specify  a   value   for
                               Fade-out,  the image will disappear abruptly at
                               the end of the inserted image duration.

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Specify the height of  the  inserted  image  in
                               pixels.  If  you  specify a value that's larger
                               than the video resolution height,  the  service
                               will  crop  your  overlaid image to fit. To use
                               the native height of the image, keep this  set-
                               ting blank.

                            ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                               Specify  the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 location
                               of the image that you want to  overlay  on  the
                               video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                            ImageX -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between the
                               inserted image and the left edge of  the  video
                               frame.  Required for any image overlay that you
                               specify.

                            ImageY -> (integer)
                               Specify the distance, in  pixels,  between  the
                               overlaid  image  and  the top edge of the video
                               frame. Required for any image overlay that  you
                               specify.

                            Layer -> (integer)
                               Specify how overlapping inserted images appear.
                               Images with higher values for Layer  appear  on
                               top of images with lower values for Layer.

                            Opacity -> (integer)
                               Use  Opacity  (Opacity)  to specify how much of
                               the underlying video shows through the inserted
                               image.  0  is  transparent  and  100  is  fully
                               opaque. Default is 50.

                            StartTime -> (string)
                               Specify the timecode of the frame that you want
                               the overlay to first appear on. This must be in
                               timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF or  HH:MM:SS;FF)  format.
                               Remember  to  take  into  account your timecode
                               source settings.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Specify the width of the inserted image in pix-
                               els.  If you specify a value that's larger than
                               the video resolution width,  the  service  will
                               crop your overlaid image to fit. To use the na-
                               tive width of  the  image,  keep  this  setting
                               blank.

                 InputClippings -> (list)
                     (InputClippings)  contains  sets  of  start and end times
                     that together specify a portion of the input to  be  used
                     in  the  outputs.  If  you provide only a start time, the
                     clip will be the entire input from that point to the end.
                     If  you  provide  only an end time, it will be the entire
                     input up to that point. When you specify  more  than  one
                     input  clip, the transcoding service creates the job out-
                     puts by stringing the clips together  in  the  order  you
                     specify them.

                     (structure)
                        To  transcode only portions of your input, include one
                        input clip for each part of your input that  you  want
                        in  your output. All input clips that you specify will
                        be included in every output of the job. For  more  in-
                        formation,                                         see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                        EndTimecode -> (string)
                            Set  End  timecode (EndTimecode) to the end of the
                            portion of the input you are clipping.  The  frame
                            corresponding  to  the  End  timecode value is in-
                            cluded in the clip. Start timecode or End timecode
                            may  be  left  blank, but not both. Use the format
                            HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is the  hour,
                            MM  is the minute, SS is the second, and FF is the
                            frame number. When choosing this value, take  into
                            account your setting for timecode source under in-
                            put settings (InputTimecodeSource).  For  example,
                            if  you  have  embedded  timecodes  that  start at
                            01:00:00:00 and you want your clip to end six min-
                            utes into the video, use 01:06:00:00.

                        StartTimecode -> (string)
                            Set  Start  timecode (StartTimecode) to the begin-
                            ning of the portion of the input you are clipping.
                            The  frame  corresponding  to  the  Start timecode
                            value is included in the clip. Start  timecode  or
                            End  timecode may be left blank, but not both. Use
                            the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH is
                            the  hour, MM is the minute, SS is the second, and
                            FF is the frame number. When choosing this  value,
                            take  into account your setting for Input timecode
                            source. For example, if you  have  embedded  time-
                            codes  that start at 01:00:00:00 and you want your
                            clip to begin five minutes  into  the  video,  use
                            01:05:00:00.

                 InputScanType -> (string)
                     When  you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF) input,
                     use this setting to flag the input as  PsF.  MediaConvert
                     doesn't  automatically  detect  PsF.  Therefore, flagging
                     your input as PsF results in better preservation of video
                     quality  when you do deinterlacing and frame rate conver-
                     sion. If you don't specify, the  default  value  is  Auto
                     (AUTO).  Auto  is the correct setting for all inputs that
                     are not PsF. Don't set this value to PsF when your  input
                     is  interlaced.  Doing  so creates horizontal interlacing
                     artifacts.

                 Position -> (structure)
                     Use Selection placement (position) to  define  the  video
                     area  in  your output frame. The area outside of the rec-
                     tangle that you specify here is black. If you  specify  a
                     value  here,  it will override any value that you specify
                     in the output setting Selection placement (position).  If
                     you specify a value here, this will override any AFD val-
                     ues in your input, even if you set Respond  to  AFD  (Re-
                     spondToAfd)  to Respond (RESPOND). If you specify a value
                     here, this will ignore anything that you specify for  the
                     setting Scaling Behavior (scalingBehavior).

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left edge of the video frame. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top edge of the video frame. Specify  only  even  num-
                        bers.

                 ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                     Use  Program (programNumber) to select a specific program
                     from within a multi-program transport stream.  Note  that
                     Quad  4K is not currently supported. Default is the first
                     program within the transport stream. If the  program  you
                     specify  doesn't  exist, the transcoding service will use
                     this default.

                 PsiControl -> (string)
                     Set PSI control (InputPsiControl)  for  transport  stream
                     inputs  to specify which data the demux process to scans.
                     * Ignore PSI - Scan all PIDs for audio and video.  *  Use
                     PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                 TimecodeSource -> (string)
                     Use this Timecode source setting, located under the input
                     settings (InputTimecodeSource), to specify how  the  ser-
                     vice  counts  input  video frames. This input frame count
                     affects only the behavior of features  that  apply  to  a
                     single  input  at a time, such as input clipping and syn-
                     chronizing some captions formats. Choose Embedded (EMBED-
                     DED)  to  use  the  timecodes in your input video. Choose
                     Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to start  the  first  frame  at
                     zero.  Choose  Specified  start (SPECIFIEDSTART) to start
                     the first frame at the timecode that you specify  in  the
                     setting  Start  timecode  (timecodeStart).  If  you don't
                     specify a value for Timecode source, the service will use
                     Embedded  by  default.  For  more information about time-
                     codes,                                                see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                 TimecodeStart -> (string)
                     Specify the timecode that you want the service to use for
                     this input's initial frame. To use this setting, you must
                     set the Timecode source setting, located under the  input
                     settings (InputTimecodeSource), to Specified start (SPEC-
                     IFIEDSTART). For more information  about  timecodes,  see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                 VideoSelector -> (structure)
                     Input video selectors contain the video settings for  the
                     input.  Each  of your inputs can have up to one video se-
                     lector.

                     AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless this input is  a  QuickTime
                        animation  with  an alpha channel. Use this setting to
                        create separate Key and Fill outputs. In each  output,
                        specify  which  part  of  the input MediaConvert uses.
                        Leave this setting at the  default  value  DISCARD  to
                        delete  the  alpha channel and preserve the video. Set
                        it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to delete the video  and  map  the
                        alpha channel to the luma channel of your outputs.

                     ColorSpace -> (string)
                        If your input video has accurate color space metadata,
                        or if you don't know about color space, leave this set
                        to the default value Follow (FOLLOW). The service will
                        automatically detect your input color space.  If  your
                        input  video  has  metadata indicating the wrong color
                        space, specify the accurate color space here. If  your
                        input  video is HDR 10 and the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering
                        Display Color Volume static metadata isn't present  in
                        your  video stream, or if that metadata is present but
                        not accurate, choose Force HDR 10  (FORCE_HDR10)  here
                        and  specify  correct values in the input HDR 10 meta-
                        data (Hdr10Metadata) settings.  For  more  information
                        about       MediaConvert       HDR      jobs,      see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/hdr.

                     ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                        There are two sources for color  metadata,  the  input
                        file  and  the  job  input  settings Color space (Col-
                        orSpace)  and  HDR  master  display  information  set-
                        tings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space usage setting
                        determines  which  takes  precedence.   Choose   Force
                        (FORCE)  to use color metadata from the input job set-
                        tings. If you don't specify values for those settings,
                        the  service  defaults to using metadata from your in-
                        put. FALLBACK -  Choose  Fallback  (FALLBACK)  to  use
                        color  metadata from the source when it is present. If
                        there's no color metadata in your input file, the ser-
                        vice defaults to using values you specify in the input
                        settings.

                     Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that  is
                        missing or inaccurate in your input video. Appropriate
                        values vary depending on the input video and  must  be
                        provided by a color grader. The color grader generates
                        these values during the HDR 10 mastering process.  The
                        valid range for each of these settings is 0 to 50,000.
                        Each increment represents 0.00002 in CIE1931 color co-
                        ordinate.  Related  settings  - When you specify these
                        values, you must also set Color space (ColorSpace)  to
                        HDR  10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values you
                        specify here take precedence over the  values  in  the
                        metadata  of  your  input  file, set Color space usage
                        (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether  color  metadata
                        is  included  in  an  output, set Color metadata (Col-
                        orMetadata). For more information  about  MediaConvert
                        HDR                      jobs,                     see

                        BluePrimaryX -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a  color  grader, using color grading tools. Range
                            is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents  0.00002
                            in  CIE1931  color coordinate. Note that this set-
                            ting is not for color correction.

                        MaxContentLightLevel -> (integer)
                            Maximum light level among all samples in the coded
                            video  sequence,  in  units of candelas per square
                            meter. This setting doesn't have a default  value;
                            you  must specify a value that is suitable for the
                            content.

                        MaxFrameAverageLightLevel -> (integer)
                            Maximum average light level of any  frame  in  the
                            coded  video  sequence,  in  units of candelas per
                            square meter. This setting doesn't have a  default
                            value;  you  must specify a value that is suitable
                            for the content.

                        MaxLuminance -> (integer)
                            Nominal maximum  mastering  display  luminance  in
                            units of of 0.0001 candelas per square meter.

                            units of of 0.0001 candelas per square meter

                        RedPrimaryX -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a  color  grader, using color grading tools. Range
                            is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents  0.00002
                            in  CIE1931  color coordinate. Note that this set-

                        WhitePointX -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a  color  grader, using color grading tools. Range
                            is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents  0.00002
                            in  CIE1931  color coordinate. Note that this set-
                            ting is not for color correction.

                        WhitePointY -> (integer)
                            HDR Master Display Information must be provided by
                            a  color  grader, using color grading tools. Range
                            is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents  0.00002

                            ting is not for color correction.

                     Pid -> (integer)
                        Use PID (Pid) to select specific video  data  from  an
                        input file. Specify this value as an integer; the sys-
                        tem  automatically  converts  it  to  the  hexidecimal
                        value.  For  example, 257 selects PID 0x101. A PID, or
                        packet identifier, is an identifier for a set of  data
                        in an MPEG-2 transport stream container.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Selects a specific program from within a multi-program
                        transport stream. Note that Quad 4K is  not  currently
                        supported.

                     Rotate -> (string)
                        Use  Rotate  (InputRotate)  to specify how the service
                        rotates your video. You can choose automatic  rotation
                        or specify a rotation. You can specify a clockwise ro-
                        tation of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.  If  your  input
                        video container is .mov or .mp4 and your input has ro-
                        tation metadata, you can choose Automatic to have  the
                        service  rotate  your  video according to the rotation
                        specified in the metadata. The rotation must be within
                        one degree of 90, 180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation
                        metadata specifies any  other  rotation,  the  service
                        will  default  to no rotation. By default, the service
                        does no rotation, even if your input video  has  rota-
                        tion  metadata. The service doesn't pass through rota-
                        tion metadata.

                     SampleRange -> (string)
                        If the sample range metadata in your  input  video  is
                        accurate,  or  if  you  don't know about sample range,
                        keep the default value, Follow (FOLLOW), for this set-
                        ting.  When  you do, the service automatically detects
                        your input sample range. If your input video has meta-
                        data  indicating  the  wrong sample range, specify the
                        accurate sample range here. When you do,  MediaConvert
                        ignores  any  sample  range  information  in the input
                        metadata. Regardless of whether MediaConvert uses  the
                        input  sample range or the sample range that you spec-
                        ify, MediaConvert uses the sample range for  transcod-
                        ing and also writes it to the output metadata.

          KantarWatermark -> (structure)
              Use  these settings only when you use Kantar watermarking. Spec-
              ify the values that MediaConvert uses to generate and place Kan-
              tar watermarks in your output audio. These settings apply to ev-
              ery output in your job. In addition to specifying these  values,
              you  also  need  to store your Kantar credentials in AWS Secrets
              Manager.        For        more         information,         see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 Provide an audio channel name from your Kantar audio license.

              ContentReference -> (string)
                 Specify a unique identifier for Kantar to use for this  piece
                 of content.

              CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                 Provide the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret where your
                 Kantar credentials are stored. Note  that  your  MediaConvert
                 service role must provide access to this secret. For more in-
                 formation,                                                see

                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html,
                 in the AWS Secrets Manager User Guide.

              FileOffset -> (double)
                 Optional. Specify an offset, in whole seconds, from the start
                 of  your  output  and the beginning of the watermarking. When
                 you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to zero.

              KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                 Provide your Kantar license ID number. You  should  get  this
                 number from Kantar.

              KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                 Provide  the  HTTPS endpoint to the Kantar server. You should
                 get this endpoint from Kantar.

              LogDestination -> (string)
                 Optional. Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want  Media-
                 Convert  to  store  your  Kantar watermark XML logs. When you
                 don't specify a bucket, MediaConvert doesn't save these logs.
                 Note  that your MediaConvert service role must provide access
                 to    this    location.    For    more    information,    see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

              Metadata3 -> (string)
                 You can optionally use this field to specify the first  time-
                 stamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking. Kantar suggests
                 that you be very cautious when using this Kantar feature, and
                 that  you  use  it only on channels that are managed specifi-
                 cally for use with this feature by your Audience  Measurement
                 Operator.  For  more  information about this feature, contact
                 Kantar technical support.

              Metadata4 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata5 -> (string)
                 Additional  metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar. Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata6 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata7 -> (string)
                 Additional  metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar. Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

              Metadata8 -> (string)
                 Additional metadata that MediaConvert sends to Kantar.  Maxi-
                 mum length is 50 characters.

          MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
              Overlay  motion graphics on top of your video. The motion graph-
              ics that you specify here appear on all outputs  in  all  output
              groups.         For         more         information,        see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

              Framerate -> (structure)
                 If  your  motion graphic asset is a .mov file, keep this set-
                 ting unspecified. If your motion graphic asset is a series of
                 .png  files,  specify the frame rate of the overlay in frames
                 per second, as a fraction. For example,  specify  24  fps  as
                 24/1.  Make  sure  that  the  number of images in your series
                 matches the frame rate and your  intended  overlay  duration.
                 For  example,  if you want a 30-second overlay at 30 fps, you
                 should have 900 .png images. This overlay frame rate  doesn't
                 need to match the frame rate of the underlying video.

                 FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                     The  bottom  of  the fraction that expresses your overlay
                     frame rate. For example, if your frame rate  is  24  fps,
                     set this value to 1.

                 FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                     The top of the fraction that expresses your overlay frame
                     rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps, set this
                     value to 24.

              Input -> (string)
                 Specify  the  .mov file or series of .png files that you want
                 to overlay on your video. For .png files,  provide  the  file
                 name  of  the  first  file  in the series. Make sure that the
                 names of the .png files  end  with  sequential  numbers  that
                 specify the order that they are played in. For example, over-
                 lay_000.png, overlay_001.png, overlay_002.png, and so on. The
                 sequence  must  start  at zero, and each image file name must
                 have the same number of digits. Pad your initial  file  names
                 with  enough  zeros to complete the sequence. For example, if
                 the first image is overlay_0.png, there can be only 10 images
                 in the sequence, with the last image being overlay_9.png. But
                 if the first image is overlay_00.png, there can be 100 images
                 in the sequence.

              InsertionMode -> (string)
                 Choose  the type of motion graphic asset that you are provid-
                 ing for your overlay. You can choose either a .mov file or  a
                 series of .png files.

              Offset -> (structure)
                 Use  Offset  to  specify the placement of your motion graphic
                 overlay on the video frame. Specify in pixels, from  the  up-
                 per-left corner of the frame. If you don't specify an offset,
                 the service scales your overlay  to  the  full  size  of  the
                 frame.  Otherwise, the service inserts the overlay at its na-
                 tive resolution and scales the size up or down with any video
                 scaling.

                 ImageX -> (integer)
                     Set  the distance, in pixels, between the overlay and the
                     left edge of the video frame.

                 ImageY -> (integer)
                     Set the distance, in pixels, between the overlay and  the
                     top edge of the video frame.

              Playback -> (string)
                 Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on a loop
                 or plays only once.

              StartTime -> (string)
                 Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use  timecode  format
                 (HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF). Make sure that the timecode you
                 provide here takes into account how  you  have  set  up  your
                 timecode configuration under both job settings and input set-
                 tings. The simplest way to do that is to set both to start at
                 0.  If you need to set up your job to follow timecodes embed-
                 ded in your source that don't start at zero, make  sure  that
                 you  specify  a  start  time that is after the first embedded
                 timecode. For  more  information,  see  https://docs.aws.ama-
                 zon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/setting-up-timecode.html  Find
                 job-wide and input timecode configuration  settings  in  your
                 JSON  job  settings  specification  at  settings>timecodeCon-
                 fig>source and settings>inputs>timecodeSource.

          NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
              Settings for your Nielsen configuration. If you don't do Nielsen
              measurement  and  analytics, ignore these settings. When you en-
              able Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfiguration),  MediaConvert
              enables PCM to ID3 tagging for all outputs in the job. To enable
              Nielsen configuration programmatically, include an  instance  of
              nielsenConfiguration in your JSON job specification. Even if you
              don't include any children of  nielsenConfiguration,  you  still
              enable the setting.

              BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                 Nielsen has discontinued the use of breakout code functional-
                 ity. If you must include this  property,  set  the  value  to
                 zero.

              DistributorId -> (string)
                 Use Distributor ID (DistributorID) to specify the distributor
                 ID that is assigned to your organization by Neilsen.

          NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
              Ignore these settings unless you are  using  Nielsen  non-linear
              watermarking.  Specify the values that MediaConvert uses to gen-
              erate and place Nielsen watermarks in your output audio. In  ad-
              dition  to specifying these values, you also need to set up your
              cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every output  in  your
              job.  The MediaConvert implementation is currently with the fol-
              lowing Nielsen versions: Nielsen  Watermark  SDK  Version  5.2.1
              Nielsen NLM Watermark Engine Version 1.2.7 Nielsen Watermark Au-
              thenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

              ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                 Choose the type of Nielsen watermarks that you want  in  your
                 outputs.  When  you  choose NAES 2 and NW (NAES2_AND_NW), you
                 must provide a value for the setting SID (sourceId). When you
                 choose  CBET (CBET), you must provide a value for the setting
                 CSID (cbetSourceId). When you choose NAES  2,  NW,  and  CBET
                 (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),  you must provide values for both of
                 these settings.

              AdiFilename -> (string)
                 Optional. Use this setting when you want the service  to  in-
                 clude  an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To pro-
                 vide an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide a URL  to
                 it   here.  The  URL  should  be  in  the  following  format:
                 S3://bucket/path/ADI-file. For  more  information  about  the
                 metadata  .zip  file,  see  the  setting Metadata destination
                 (metadataDestination).

              AssetId -> (string)
                 Use the asset ID that you  provide  to  Nielsen  to  uniquely
                 identify  this asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear wa-
                 termarking.

              AssetName -> (string)
                 Use the asset name that you provide to Nielsen for  this  as-
                 set. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

              CbetSourceId -> (string)
                 Use  the  CSID that Nielsen provides to you. This CBET source
                 ID should be unique to your Nielsen account but common to all
                 of  your  output assets that have CBET watermarking. Required
                 when you choose a value for the setting Watermark types  (Ac-
                 tiveWatermarkProcess) that includes CBET.

              EpisodeId -> (string)
                 Optional. If this asset uses an episode ID with Nielsen, pro-
                 vide it here.

              MetadataDestination -> (string)
                 Specify the Amazon S3 location where you want MediaConvert to
                 save  your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip file. This Amazon
                 S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the one where you  do
                 your  MediaConvert transcoding. If you want to include an ADI
                 file in this .zip file, use the setting  ADI  file  (adiFile-
                 name)  to specify it. MediaConvert delivers the Nielsen meta-
                 data .zip files only to your metadata destination  Amazon  S3
                 bucket. It doesn't deliver the .zip files to Nielsen. You are
                 responsible  for  delivering  the  metadata  .zip  files   to
                 Nielsen.

              SourceId -> (integer)
                 Use  the  SID  that  Nielsen  provides to you. This source ID
                 should be unique to your Nielsen account but common to all of
                 your  output  assets. Required for all Nielsen non-linear wa-
                 termarking. This ID should be unique to your Nielsen  account
                 but  common  to  all  of your output assets. Required for all
                 Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

              SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                 Required. Specify whether your source  content  already  con-
                 tains  Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this value
                 to Watermarked (WATERMARKED),  the  service  fails  the  job.
                 Nielsen requires that you add non-linear watermarking to only
                 clean content that doesn't already  have  non-linear  Nielsen
                 watermarks.

              TicServerUrl -> (string)
                 Specify  the  endpoint  for  the TIC server that you have de-
                 ployed and configured in the  AWS  Cloud.  Required  for  all
                 Nielsen  non-linear  watermarking. MediaConvert can't connect
                 directly to a TIC server. Instead, you must use  API  Gateway
                 to provide a RESTful interface between MediaConvert and a TIC
                 server that you deploy in your AWS account. For more informa-
                 tion  on  deploying  a TIC server in your AWS account and the
                 required API Gateway, contact Nielsen support.

              UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                 To create assets that have the same TIC values in each  audio
                 track,     keep     the     default    value    Share    TICs
                 (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK). To create assets that have unique  TIC
                 values  for  each  audio  track,  choose Use unique TICs (RE-
                 SERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

          OutputGroups -> (list)
              (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for  each  set  of
              outputs  that  share a common package type. All unpackaged files
              (MPEG-4, MPEG-2  TS,  Quicktime,  MXF,  and  no  container)  are
              grouped  in  a single output group as well. Required in (Output-
              Groups) is a group of settings that apply to  the  whole  group.
              This required object depends on the value you set for (Type) un-
              der (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings). Type, settings  object
              pairs are as follows. * FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS, FileGroupSettings *
              HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS, HlsGroupSettings *  DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,
              DashIsoGroupSettings   *   MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,   MsSmooth-
              GroupSettings * CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

              (structure)
                 Group of outputs

                 AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                     Use automated encoding to have MediaConvert  choose  your
                     encoding  settings  for  you, based on characteristics of
                     your input video.

                     AbrSettings -> (structure)
                        Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up the ren-
                        ditions  in  your  ABR  package for you automatically,
                        based on characteristics of  your  input  video.  This
                        feature  optimizes  video quality while minimizing the
                        overall size of your ABR package.

                        MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                            Optional. The maximum target bit rate used in your
                            automated  ABR stack. Use this value to set an up-
                            per limit on the bandwidth consumed by  the  high-
                            est-quality  rendition. This is the rendition that
                            is delivered to viewers with the fastest  internet
                            connections.  If you don't specify a value, Media-
                            Convert uses 8,000,000 (8 mb/s) by default.

                        MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                            Optional. The maximum number  of  renditions  that
                            MediaConvert  will  create  in  your automated ABR
                            stack. The number of renditions is determined  au-
                            tomatically,  based  on  analysis of each job, but
                            will never exceed this limit. When you set this to
                            Auto  in  the  console, which is equivalent to ex-
                            cluding it from your JSON job specification, Medi-
                            aConvert defaults to a limit of 15.

                        MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                            Optional.  The minimum target bitrate used in your
                            automated ABR stack. Use this value to set a lower
                            limit on the bitrate of video delivered to viewers
                            with slow internet connections. If you don't spec-
                            ify  a value, MediaConvert uses 600,000 (600 kb/s)
                            by default.

                 CustomName -> (string)
                     Use Custom Group Name (CustomName) to specify a name  for
                     the  output group. This value is displayed on the console
                     and can make your job settings JSON more  human-readable.
                     It does not affect your outputs. Use up to twelve charac-
                     ters that are either letters, numbers, spaces, or  under-
                     scores.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name of the output group

                 OutputGroupSettings -> (structure)
                     Output Group settings, including type

                     CmafGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your CMAF output package. For more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.
                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set    Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,     to
                        CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By  default,  the  service  creates  one top-level
                            .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top  -level  .mpd  DASH
                            manifest  for  each CMAF output group in your job.
                            These default manifests reference every output  in
                            the  output  group. To create additional top-level
                            manifests that reference a subset of  the  outputs
                            in  the output group, specify a list of them here.
                            For each additional manifest that you specify, the
                            service creates one HLS manifest and one DASH man-
                            ifest.

                            (structure)
                               Specify the details for each pair  of  HLS  and
                               DASH  additional  manifests  that  you want the
                               service to generate for this CMAF output group.
                               Each  pair of manifests can reference a differ-
                               ent subset of outputs in the group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify a name modifier  that  the  service
                                   adds  to  the name of this manifest to make
                                   it different from the  file  names  of  the
                                   other  main  manifests in the output group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your HLS group is film-name.m3u8.
                                   If you enter "-no-premium"  for  this  set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates  for  this   top-level   manifest   is
                                   film-name-no-premium.m3u8.  For  HLS output
                                   groups, specify a manifestNameModifier that
                                   is  different  from the nameModifier of the
                                   output. The service uses  the  output  name
                                   modifier to create unique names for the in-
                                   dividual variant manifests.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify the outputs that you want this  ad-
                                   ditional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        BaseUrl -> (string)
                            A partial URI prefix that will be put in the mani-
                            fest file at the top level BaseURL element. Can be
                            used if streams are delivered from a different URL
                            than the manifest file.

                        ClientCache -> (string)
                            Disable this setting only when your  workflow  re-
                            quires  the  #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Otherwise,
                            keep the default value Enabled (ENABLED) and  con-
                            trol  caching  in  your video distribution set up.
                            For example, use the Cache-Control http header.

                        CodecSpecification -> (string)
                            Specification to  use  (RFC-6381  or  the  default
                            RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify the S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify the base filename in the URI, the  service
                            will  use  the filename of the input file. If your
                            job has multiple  inputs,  the  service  uses  the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  associated  with  the  destination. Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional. Have  MediaConvert  automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts in this output group. When  you  don't
                                   use  this setting, S3 automatically applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings  for  how your job outputs are en-
                                   crypted as they are uploaded to Amazon S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).   By   de-
                                      fault, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses
                                      the  AWS  managed  customer  master  key
                                      (CMK)  associated  with Amazon S3 to en-
                                      crypt your data keys. You can optionally
                                      choose  to specify a different, customer
                                      managed CMK. Do  so  by  specifying  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key
                                      for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the encryption  con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS key. AWS KMS  uses  this  encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD) to support  authenticated  encryp-
                                      tion.  This  value  must be a base64-en-
                                      coded UTF-8 string  holding  JSON  which
                                      represents  a  string-string map. To use
                                      this  setting,   you   must   also   set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS

                                      Optionally,  specify the customer master
                                      key (CMK) that you want to  use  to  en-
                                      crypt  the data key that AWS uses to en-
                                      crypt your  output  content.  Enter  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the CMK.
                                      To use this setting, you must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side encryption to  AWS  KMS  but
                                      don't  specify  a CMK here, AWS uses the
                                      AWS managed CMK associated  with  Amazon
                                      S3.

                               service to use when encrypting your  CMAF  seg-
                               ments. Choose AES-CBC subsample (SAMPLE-AES) or
                               AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                            InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                               When you use  DRM  with  CMAF  outputs,  choose
                               whether  the service writes the 128-bit encryp-
                               tion initialization vector in the HLS and  DASH
                               manifests.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                               If  your  output  group type is CMAF, use these
                               settings  when  doing  DRM  encryption  with  a
                               SPEKE-compliant  key  provider.  If your output
                               group type is HLS, DASH, or  Microsoft  Smooth,
                               use the SpekeKeyProvider settings instead.

                               CertificateArn -> (string)
                                   If  you  want  your key provider to encrypt
                                   the content keys that it provides to Media-
                                   Convert, set up a certificate with a master
                                   key using AWS Certificate Manager.  Specify
                                   the   certificate's  Amazon  Resource  Name
                                   (ARN) here.

                        FragmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of  the  mp4
                            fragments.  When you don't specify a value, Media-
                            Convert defaults to 2. Related setting: Use  Frag-
                            ment  length  control  (FragmentLengthControl)  to
                            specify whether the encoder  enforces  this  value
                            strictly.

                        ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                            Specify  whether MediaConvert generates images for
                            trick play. Keep the default value,  None  (NONE),
                            to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose  Thumbnail
                            (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumbnails.  Choose
                            Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)
                            to generate tiled thumbnails  and  full-resolution
                            images of single frames. When you enable Write HLS
                            manifest (WriteHlsManifest), MediaConvert  creates
                            a  child  manifest for each set of images that you
                            generate and adds  corresponding  entries  to  the
                            parent  manifest. When you enable Write DASH mani-
                            fest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds an en-
                            try  in  the  .mpd manifest for each set of images
                            that you generate. A common application for  these
                            images  is  Roku  trick  mode.  The thumbnails and
                            full-frame images that MediaConvert  creates  with
                            this  feature are compatible with this Roku speci-

                            IntervalCadence -> (string)
                               The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating
                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)

                               age, in pixels. Leave blank to maintain  aspect
                               ratio  with  thumbnail  width. If following the
                               aspect ratio would lead to a total tile  height
                               greater  than  4096,  then  the job will be re-
                               jected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-

                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                               Width of each thumbnail within each tile image,
                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each column of  a  tile
                               image.  Set a value between 2 and 2048. Must be
                               divisible by 2.

                            TileWidth -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each row of a tile  im-
                               age. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the output manifest should use
                            floating point values for segment duration.

                        MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                            Minimum time of initially buffered media  that  is
                            needed to ensure smooth playout.

                        MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                            Keep  this  setting at the default value of 0, un-
                            less you are troubleshooting a  problem  with  how
                            devices  play back the end of your video asset. If
                            you know that player devices are  hanging  on  the
                            final  segment of your video because the length of
                            your final segment is too short, use this  setting
                            to specify a minimum final segment length, in sec-
                            onds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal
                            to  1  and less than your segment length. When you
                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For  example, your segment length is 3 seconds and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final segment length; when you set the minimum fi-
                            nal segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                            seconds.

                        MpdProfile -> (string)
                            Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand or
                            main. When you choose Main profile (MAIN_PROFILE),
                            the                 service                signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011 in your .mpd
                            DASH  manifest.  When you choose On-demand (ON_DE-
                            MAND_PROFILE),      the      service       signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011 in your
                            .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must also set
                            the output group setting Segment control (Segment-
                            Control) to Single file (SINGLE_FILE).

                        PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                            Use this  setting  only  when  your  output  video
                            stream has B-frames, which causes the initial pre-
                            sentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset  from  the
                            initial decode time stamp (DTS). Specify how Medi-
                            aConvert handles PTS when writing time  stamps  in
                            output  DASH  manifests.  Choose Match initial PTS
                            (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want MediaConvert  to
                            use the initial PTS as the first time stamp in the
                            manifest. Choose Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have
                            MediaConvert  ignore  the initial PTS in the video
                            stream and instead write the initial time stamp as
                            zero  in the manifest. For outputs that don't have
                            B-frames, the time stamps in your  DASH  manifests
                            start at zero regardless of your choice here.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file is
                            generated, which is internally segmented using the
                            Fragment  Length  and  Segment Length. When set to
                            SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment  files  will  be
                            created.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults  to  10.  Related  settings:  Use Segment
                            length control (SegmentLengthControl)  to  specify
                            whether  the encoder enforces this value strictly.
                            Use Segment control (CmafSegmentControl) to  spec-
                            ify  whether MediaConvert creates separate segment
                            files or one content file  that  has  metadata  to
                            mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to  have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Segment length  (SegmentLength).  This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for  video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                            When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration is
                            always rounded up to  the  nearest  integer  value
                            above  its  current  value in seconds. When set to
                            SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment  target  duration  is
                            rounded  up  to the nearest integer value if frac-
                            tion seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5  (>=
                            0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (<0.5). You
                            may need to use LEGACY if your client needs to en-
                            sure  that  the  target  duration is always longer
                            than the actual  duration  of  the  segment.  Some
                            older  players may experience interrupted playback
                            when the actual duration of a track in  a  segment
                            is longer than the target duration.

                        WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                            When  set  to ENABLED, a DASH MPD manifest will be
                            generated for this output.

                        WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                            When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will be
                            generated for this output.

                        WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                            When  you  enable Precise segment duration in DASH
                            manifests  (writeSegmentTimelineInRepresentation),
                            your  DASH  manifest  shows  precise segment dura-
                            tions. The segment  duration  information  appears
                            inside  the  SegmentTimeline  element, inside Seg-
                            mentTemplate at  the  Representation  level.  When
                            this  feature isn't enabled, the segment durations
                            in your DASH manifest are approximate. The segment
                            duration  information  appears in the duration at-
                            tribute of the SegmentTemplate element.

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By default, the service creates one .mpd DASH man-
                            ifest  for each DASH ISO output group in your job.
                            This default manifest references every  output  in
                            the  output group. To create additional DASH mani-
                            fests that reference a subset of  the  outputs  in
                            the output group, specify a list of them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the  details  for each additional DASH
                               manifest that you want the service to  generate
                               for this output group. Each manifest can refer-
                               ence a  different  subset  of  outputs  in  the
                               group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your DASH group is film-name.mpd.
                                   If  you  enter  "-no-premium" for this set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates   for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                   film-name-no-premium.mpd.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify the outputs that you want this  ad-

                                   (string)

                        AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting only when your audio codec is a
                            Dolby one (AC3, EAC3, or  Atmos)  and  your  down-
                            stream  workflow  requires that your DASH manifest
                            use the Dolby channel  configuration  tag,  rather
                            than  the MPEG one. For example, you might need to
                            use this to make dynamic ad insertion work.  Spec-
                            ify  which  audio  channel configuration scheme ID
                            URI MediaConvert writes  in  your  DASH  manifest.
                            Keep the default value, MPEG channel configuration
                            (MPEG_CHANNEL_CONFIGURATION), to have MediaConvert
                            write                                        this:
                            urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.   Choose
                            Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHANNEL_CONFIG-
                            URATION) to have MediaConvert write this  instead:
                            tag:dolby.com,2014:dash:audio_channel_configuration:2011.

                        BaseUrl -> (string)
                            A partial URI prefix that will be put in the mani-
                            fest (.mpd) file at the top level BaseURL element.
                            Can be used if streams are delivered from  a  dif-
                            ferent URL than the manifest file.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify the S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify the base filename in the URI, the  service
                            will  use  the filename of the input file. If your
                            job has multiple  inputs,  the  service  uses  the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  associated  with  the  destination. Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-

                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).   By   de-
                                      fault, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses
                                      the  AWS  managed  customer  master  key
                                      (CMK)  associated  with Amazon S3 to en-

                                      choose  to specify a different, customer
                                      managed CMK. Do  so  by  specifying  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key
                                      for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KMS key. AWS KMS  uses  this  encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data

                                      represents  a  string-string map. To use
                                      this  setting,   you   must   also   set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-

                                      Optionally,  specify the customer master
                                      key (CMK) that you want to  use  to  en-
                                      crypt  the data key that AWS uses to en-
                                      crypt your  output  content.  Enter  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the CMK.
                                      To use this setting, you must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-

                               with DRM  encryption.  Choose  Unencrypted  SEI
                               (UNENCRYPTED_SEI) only to correct problems with
                               playback on older devices. Otherwise, keep  the
                               default  setting  CENC  v1  (CENC_V1).  If  you
                               choose Unencrypted SEI, for  that  output,  the
                               service  will exclude the access unit delimiter
                               and will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)

                        FragmentLength -> (integer)
                            Length of  fragments  to  generate  (in  seconds).
                            Fragment  length  must be compatible with GOP size
                            and Framerate. Note that fragments will end on the
                            next keyframe after this number of seconds, so ac-
                            tual fragment length may be longer. When Emit Sin-
                            gle File is checked, the fragmentation is internal
                            to a single output file and it does not cause  the
                            creation  of  many output files as in other output
                            types.

                        ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                            Specify whether MediaConvert generates images  for
                            trick  play.  Keep the default value, None (NONE),
                            to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose  Thumbnail
                            (THUMBNAIL)  to  generate tiled thumbnails. Choose
                            Thumbnail and full frame (THUMBNAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)
                            to  generate  tiled thumbnails and full-resolution
                            images of single frames. MediaConvert adds an  en-
                            try  in  the  .mpd manifest for each set of images
                            that you generate. A common application for  these
                            images  is  Roku  trick  mode.  The thumbnails and

                            IntervalCadence -> (string)
                               The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating
                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                               Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile im-
                               age, in pixels. Leave blank to maintain  aspect
                               ratio  with  thumbnail  width. If following the
                               aspect ratio would lead to a total tile  height
                               greater  than  4096,  then  the job will be re-
                               jected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses to generate thumbnails. If the inter-
                               val you enter doesn't  align  with  the  output
                               frame  rate,  MediaConvert automatically rounds
                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)

                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)

                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For example, your segment length is 3 seconds  and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final segment length; when you set the minimum fi-
                            nal segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                            seconds.

                        MpdProfile -> (string)
                            Specify whether your DASH profile is on-demand  or
                            main. When you choose Main profile (MAIN_PROFILE),
                            the                service                 signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011 in your .mpd
                            DASH manifest. When you choose  On-demand  (ON_DE-
                            MAND_PROFILE),       the      service      signals
                            urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011 in your
                            .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must also set
                            the output group setting Segment control (Segment-
                            Control) to Single file (SINGLE_FILE).

                        PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  only  when  your  output video
                            stream has B-frames, which causes the initial pre-
                            sentation  time  stamp (PTS) to be offset from the
                            initial decode time stamp (DTS). Specify how Medi-
                            aConvert  handles  PTS when writing time stamps in
                            output DASH manifests. Choose  Match  initial  PTS
                            (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS)  when you want MediaConvert to
                            use the initial PTS as the first time stamp in the
                            manifest.  Choose  Zero-based (ZERO_BASED) to have
                            MediaConvert ignore the initial PTS in  the  video
                            stream and instead write the initial time stamp as
                            zero in the manifest. For outputs that don't  have
                            B-frames,  the  time stamps in your DASH manifests
                            start at zero regardless of your choice here.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single output  file  is
                            generated, which is internally segmented using the
                            Fragment Length and Segment Length.  When  set  to
                            SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment  files will be
                            created.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults to  30.  Related  settings:  Use  Segment
                            length  control  (SegmentLengthControl) to specify
                            whether the encoder enforces this value  strictly.
                            Use  Segment  control  (DashIsoSegmentControl)  to
                            specify whether MediaConvert creates separate seg-
                            ment  files  or one content file that has metadata
                            to mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment  length.  Choose Exact (EXACT) to have the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the  setting  Segment length (SegmentLength). This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP  (GOP_MULTIPLE)  to  have the encoder round up
                            the segment lengths to match the next  GOP  bound-
                            ary.

                        WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                            If you get an HTTP error in the 400 range when you
                            play back your DASH output,  enable  this  setting
                            and  run  your transcoding job again. When you en-
                            able this setting, the service writes precise seg-
                            ment  durations  in the DASH manifest. The segment
                            duration information appears inside  the  Segment-
                            Timeline  element,  inside  SegmentTemplate at the
                            Representation level. When you don't  enable  this
                            setting,  the  service  writes approximate segment
                            durations in your DASH manifest.

                     FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your File output group.  MediaCon-
                        vert  uses this group of settings to generate a single
                        standalone file, rather than a streaming package. When
                        you  work directly in your JSON job specification, in-
                        clude this object and any required children  when  you
                        set     Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,    to
                        FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use Destination (Destination) to  specify  the  S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify  the base filename in the URI, the service
                            will use the filename of the input file.  If  your
                            job  has  multiple  inputs,  the  service uses the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings associated  with  the  destination.  Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional.  Have  MediaConvert automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts  in  this output group. When you don't
                                   use this setting, S3 automatically  applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings for how your job outputs  are  en-
                                   crypted as they are uploaded to Amazon S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves, using a customer master  key
                                      (CMK),  and  then  stores  the encrypted
                                      data keys alongside your encrypted  con-
                                      tent.  Use this setting to specify which
                                      AWS service manages the  CMK.  For  sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).   By   de-
                                      fault, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses
                                      the  AWS  managed  customer  master  key
                                      (CMK) associated with Amazon S3  to  en-
                                      crypt your data keys. You can optionally
                                      choose to specify a different,  customer
                                      managed  CMK.  Do  so  by specifying the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  key
                                      for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the encryption con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS  key.  AWS  KMS uses this encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD)  to  support authenticated encryp-
                                      tion. This value must  be  a  base64-en-
                                      coded  UTF-8  string  holding JSON which
                                      represents a string-string map.  To  use
                                      this   setting,   you   must   also  set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the customer  master
                                      key  (CMK)  that  you want to use to en-
                                      crypt the data key that AWS uses to  en-
                                      crypt  your  output  content.  Enter the
                                      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  CMK.
                                      To  use  this setting, you must also set
                                      Server-side encryption  (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)       to      AWS      KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side  encryption  to  AWS KMS but
                                      don't specify a CMK here, AWS  uses  the
                                      AWS  managed  CMK associated with Amazon
                                      S3.

                     HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to your HLS output package. For  more
                        information,                                       see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/outputs-file-ABR.html.
                        When you work directly in your JSON job specification,
                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set Type, under OutputGroupSettings, to HLS_GROUP_SET-
                        TINGS.

                        AdMarkers -> (list)
                            Choose one or more ad  marker  types  to  decorate
                            your Apple HLS manifest. This setting does not de-
                            termine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the out-
                            puts themselves.

                            (string)

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By  default,  the  service  creates  one top-level
                            .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS  output  group  in
                            your  job.  This default manifest references every
                            output in the output group. To  create  additional
                            top-level manifests that reference a subset of the
                            outputs in the output group,  specify  a  list  of
                            them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the  details  for  each additional HLS
                               manifest that you want the service to  generate
                               for this output group. Each manifest can refer-
                               ence a  different  subset  of  outputs  in  the
                               group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make

                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your HLS group is film-name.m3u8.
                                   If  you  enter  "-no-premium" for this set-
                                   ting, then the file name the service gener-
                                   ates   for   this   top-level  manifest  is
                                   film-name-no-premium.m3u8. For  HLS  output
                                   groups, specify a manifestNameModifier that
                                   is different from the nameModifier  of  the
                                   output.  The  service  uses the output name
                                   modifier to create unique names for the in-
                                   dividual variant manifests.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify the S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify the base filename in the URI, the  service
                            will  use  the filename of the input file. If your
                            job has multiple  inputs,  the  service  uses  the
                            filename of the first input file.

                                   use  this setting, S3 automatically applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)

                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).   By   de-
                                      fault, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses
                                      the  AWS  managed  customer  master  key
                                      (CMK)  associated  with Amazon S3 to en-
                                      crypt your data keys. You can optionally
                                      choose  to specify a different, customer
                                      managed CMK. Do  so  by  specifying  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key
                                      for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the encryption  con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS key. AWS KMS  uses  this  encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD) to support  authenticated  encryp-
                                      tion.  This  value  must be a base64-en-
                                      coded UTF-8 string  holding  JSON  which
                                      represents  a  string-string map. To use
                                      this  setting,   you   must   also   set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the customer master
                                      key (CMK) that you want to  use  to  en-
                                      crypt  the data key that AWS uses to en-
                                      crypt your  output  content.  Enter  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the CMK.
                                      To use this setting, you must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side encryption to  AWS  KMS  but
                                      don't  specify  a CMK here, AWS uses the
                                      AWS managed CMK associated  with  Amazon
                                      S3.

                        DirectoryStructure -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  segments  should  be placed in
                            subdirectories.

                               This is a 128-bit,  16-byte  hex  value  repre-
                               sented  by  a 32-character text string. If this
                               parameter is not set  then  the  Initialization
                               Vector  will  follow  the segment number by de-
                               fault.

                            EncryptionMethod -> (string)

                            InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                               The  Initialization  Vector is a 128-bit number
                               used in conjunction with the key for encrypting
                               blocks.  If set to INCLUDE, Initialization Vec-
                               tor is listed in the manifest.  Otherwise  Ini-
                               tialization Vector is not in the manifest.

                            OfflineEncrypted -> (string)
                               Enable  this  setting  to insert the EXT-X-SES-
                               SION-KEY element into the master playlist. This
                               allows  for  offline Apple HLS FairPlay content
                               protection.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)

                            IntervalCadence -> (string)
                               The cadence MediaConvert follows for generating
                               thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,  MediaCon-
                               vert generates thumbnails for each IDR frame in
                               the output (matching the GOP cadence).  If  set
                               to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, MediaConvert generates thumb-
                               nails according to the interval you specify  in
                               thumbnailInterval.

                            ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                               Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile im-
                               age, in pixels. Leave blank to maintain  aspect
                               ratio  with  thumbnail  width. If following the
                               aspect ratio would lead to a total tile  height
                               greater  than  4096,  then  the job will be re-
                               jected. Must be divisible by 2.

                            ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                               Enter the interval, in seconds, that  MediaCon-
                               vert uses to generate thumbnails. If the inter-
                               val you enter doesn't  align  with  the  output
                               frame  rate,  MediaConvert automatically rounds
                               the interval to align  with  the  output  frame
                               rate.  For example, if the output frame rate is
                               29.97 frames per second and you enter 5, Media-
                               Convert  uses  a 150 frame interval to generate
                               thumbnails.

                            ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                               Width of each thumbnail within each tile image,
                               in pixels. Default is 312. Must be divisible by
                               8.

                            TileHeight -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each column of  a  tile
                               image.  Set a value between 2 and 2048. Must be
                               divisible by 2.

                            TileWidth -> (integer)
                               Number of thumbnails in each row of a tile  im-
                               age. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                        ManifestCompression -> (string)
                            When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                        ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the output manifest should use
                            floating point values for segment duration.

                        MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                            Keep this setting at the default value of  0,  un-
                            less  you  are  troubleshooting a problem with how
                            devices play back the end of your video asset.  If
                            you  know  that  player devices are hanging on the
                            final segment of your video because the length  of
                            your  final segment is too short, use this setting
                            to specify a minimum final segment length, in sec-
                            onds. Choose a value that is greater than or equal
                            to 1 and less than your segment length.  When  you
                            specify a value for this setting, the encoder will
                            combine any final segment that is shorter than the
                            length that you specify with the previous segment.
                            For example, your segment length is 3 seconds  and
                            your final segment is .5 seconds without a minimum
                            final segment length; when you set the minimum fi-
                            nal segment length to 1, your final segment is 3.5
                            seconds.

                        MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                            When set, Minimum  Segment  Size  is  enforced  by
                            looking  ahead and back within the specified range
                            for a nearby avail and extending the segment  size
                            if needed.

                        OutputSelection -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the .m3u8 manifest file should
                            be generated for this HLS output group.

                        ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                            Includes or excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME  tag
                            in  .m3u8  manifest files. The value is calculated
                            as follows: either the program date and  time  are
                            initialized  using  the  input timecode source, or
                            the time is initialized using the  input  timecode
                            source and the date is initialized using the time-
                            stamp_offset.

                        ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                            Period of insertion of EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME en-
                            try, in seconds.

                        SegmentControl -> (string)
                            When set to SINGLE_FILE, emits program as a single
                            media resource (.ts) file,  uses  #EXT-X-BYTERANGE
                            tags to index segment for playback.

                        SegmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify the length, in whole seconds, of each seg-
                            ment. When you don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            defaults  to  10.  Related  settings:  Use Segment
                            length control (SegmentLengthControl)  to  specify
                            whether  the encoder enforces this value strictly.
                            Use Segment control (HlsSegmentControl) to specify
                            whether   MediaConvert  creates  separate  segment
                            files or one content file  that  has  metadata  to
                            mark the segment boundaries.

                        SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            segment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to  have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Segment length  (SegmentLength).  This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                            Number of segments to write to a subdirectory  be-
                            fore  starting  a new one. directoryStructure must
                            be SINGLE_DIRECTORY for this setting  to  have  an
                            effect.

                        StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                            Include  or exclude RESOLUTION attribute for video
                            in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant manifest.

                        TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                            When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration is
                            always  rounded  up  to  the nearest integer value
                            above its current value in seconds.  When  set  to
                            SPEC\_COMPLIANT,  the  segment  target duration is
                            rounded up to the nearest integer value  if  frac-
                            tion  seconds are greater than or equal to 0.5 (>=
                            0.5) and rounded down if less than 0.5 (<0.5). You
                            may need to use LEGACY if your client needs to en-
                            sure that the target  duration  is  always  longer
                            than  the  actual  duration  of  the segment. Some
                            older players may experience interrupted  playback
                            when  the  actual duration of a track in a segment
                            is longer than the target duration.

                        TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                            Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                        include this object and any required children when you
                        set    Type,     under     OutputGroupSettings,     to
                        MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                        AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                            By default, the service creates one .ism Microsoft
                            Smooth  Streaming  manifest  for  each   Microsoft
                            Smooth  Streaming  output  group in your job. This
                            default manifest references every  output  in  the
                            output  group. To create additional manifests that
                            reference a subset of the outputs  in  the  output
                            group, specify a list of them here.

                            (structure)
                               Specify  the details for each additional Micro-
                               soft Smooth Streaming manifest  that  you  want
                               the  service to generate for this output group.
                               Each manifest can reference a different  subset
                               of outputs in the group.

                               ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                   Specify  a  name  modifier that the service
                                   adds to the name of this manifest  to  make
                                   it  different  from  the  file names of the
                                   other main manifests in the  output  group.
                                   For example, say that the default main man-
                                   ifest for your Microsoft  Smooth  group  is
                                   film-name.ismv.  If you enter "-no-premium"
                                   for this setting, then the  file  name  the
                                   service  generates for this top-level mani-
                                   fest is film-name-no-premium.ismv.

                               SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                   Specify the outputs that you want this  ad-
                                   ditional top-level manifest to reference.

                                   (string)

                        AudioDeduplication -> (string)
                            COMBINE_DUPLICATE_STREAMS combines identical audio
                            encoding settings across a Microsoft Smooth output
                            group into a single audio stream.

                        Destination -> (string)
                            Use  Destination  (Destination)  to specify the S3
                            output location and the output filename base. Des-
                            tination accepts format identifiers. If you do not
                            specify the base filename in the URI, the  service
                            will  use  the filename of the input file. If your
                            job has multiple  inputs,  the  service  uses  the
                            filename of the first input file.

                        DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  associated  with  the  destination. Will
                            vary based on the type of destination

                            S3Settings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with S3 destination

                               AccessControl -> (structure)
                                   Optional. Have  MediaConvert  automatically
                                   apply Amazon S3 access control for the out-
                                   puts in this output group. When  you  don't
                                   use  this setting, S3 automatically applies
                                   the default access control list PRIVATE.

                                   CannedAcl -> (string)
                                      Choose an Amazon S3 canned ACL for Medi-
                                      aConvert to apply to this output.

                               Encryption -> (structure)
                                   Settings  for  how your job outputs are en-
                                   crypted as they are uploaded to Amazon S3.

                                   EncryptionType -> (string)
                                      Specify how you want your data keys man-
                                      aged. AWS uses data keys to encrypt your
                                      content. AWS also encrypts the data keys
                                      themselves,  using a customer master key
                                      (CMK), and  then  stores  the  encrypted
                                      data  keys alongside your encrypted con-
                                      tent. Use this setting to specify  which
                                      AWS  service  manages  the CMK. For sim-
                                      plest   set   up,   choose   Amazon   S3
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If you want
                                      your master key to be managed by AWS Key
                                      Management Service (KMS), choose AWS KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).   By   de-
                                      fault, when you choose AWS KMS, KMS uses
                                      the  AWS  managed  customer  master  key
                                      (CMK)  associated  with Amazon S3 to en-
                                      crypt your data keys. You can optionally
                                      choose  to specify a different, customer
                                      managed CMK. Do  so  by  specifying  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the key
                                      for the setting KMS ARN (kmsKeyArn).

                                   KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                      Optionally, specify the encryption  con-
                                      text that you want to use alongside your
                                      KMS key. AWS KMS  uses  this  encryption
                                      context as additional authenticated data
                                      (AAD) to support  authenticated  encryp-
                                      tion.  This  value  must be a base64-en-
                                      coded UTF-8 string  holding  JSON  which
                                      represents  a  string-string map. To use
                                      this  setting,   you   must   also   set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).  For  more
                                      information  about  encryption  context,
                                      see:

                                   KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                      Optionally,  specify the customer master
                                      key (CMK) that you want to  use  to  en-
                                      crypt  the data key that AWS uses to en-
                                      crypt your  output  content.  Enter  the
                                      Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the CMK.
                                      To use this setting, you must  also  set
                                      Server-side  encryption (S3ServerSideEn-
                                      cryptionType)      to      AWS       KMS
                                      (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If you set
                                      Server-side encryption to  AWS  KMS  but
                                      don't  specify  a CMK here, AWS uses the
                                      AWS managed CMK associated  with  Amazon
                                      S3.

                            SpekeKeyProvider.

                            SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                               If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or Mi-
                               crosoft Smooth, use these settings  when  doing
                               DRM   encryption  with  a  SPEKE-compliant  key
                               provider. If your output group  type  is  CMAF,
                               use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings instead.

                               CertificateArn -> (string)
                                   If  you  want  your key provider to encrypt
                                   the content keys that it provides to Media-
                                   Convert, set up a certificate with a master
                                   key using AWS Certificate Manager.  Specify
                                   the   certificate's  Amazon  Resource  Name
                                   (ARN) here.

                               ResourceId -> (string)
                                   Specify   the   resource   ID   that   your
                                   SPEKE-compliant  key provider uses to iden-
                                   tify this content.

                               SystemIds -> (list)

                                   provide keys for encrypting your content.

                        FragmentLength -> (integer)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            fragment length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to have  the
                            encoder use the exact length that you specify with
                            the setting Fragment length (FragmentLength). This
                            might result in extra I-frames. Choose Multiple of
                            GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE) to have the  encoder  round  up
                            the  segment  lengths to match the next GOP bound-
                            ary.

                        FragmentLengthControl -> (string)
                            Specify how you want MediaConvert to determine the
                            fragment  length. Choose Exact (EXACT) to have the

                        ManifestEncoding -> (string)
                            Use  Manifest  encoding (MsSmoothManifestEncoding)
                            to specify the encoding format for the server  and
                            client manifest. Valid options are utf8 and utf16.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Type of output group (File group, Apple HLS, DASH ISO,
                        Microsoft Smooth Streaming, CMAF)

                 Outputs -> (list)
                     This object holds groups of encoding settings, one  group
                     of settings per output.

                     (structure)
                        Each  output  in  your job is a collection of settings
                        that describes how you want MediaConvert to  encode  a
                        single  output  file  or stream. For more information,

                               Convert  console. In your job JSON, an instance
                               of AudioDescription is equivalent to one  audio
                               tab in the console. Usually, one audio tab cor-
                               responds to one output audio  track.  Depending
                               on  how  you  set up your input audio selectors
                               and whether you use audio selector groups,  one
                               audio  tab  can correspond to a group of output
                               audio tracks.

                               AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                   When you mimic a multi-channel audio layout
                                   with  multiple mono-channel tracks, you can
                                   tag each channel layout manually. For exam-
                                   ple,  you would tag the tracks that contain
                                   your left, right,  and  center  audio  with
                                   Left  (L),  Right  (R), and Center (C), re-
                                   spectively. When you don't specify a value,
                                   MediaConvert  labels  your  track as Center
                                   (C) by default. To use  audio  layout  tag-
                                   ging,  your  output  must be in a QuickTime
                                   (.mov) container; your audio codec must  be
                                   AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you must set up your
                                   audio track to have only one channel.

                                   ChannelTag -> (string)
                                      You can add a tag for this  mono-channel
                                      audio  track to mimic its placement in a
                                      multi-channel layout.  For  example,  if
                                      this track is the left surround channel,
                                      choose Left surround (LS).

                                   TargetLkfs -> (double)
                                      When  you  use  Audio normalization (Au-
                                      dioNormalizationSettings),    optionally
                                      use  this  setting  to  specify a target
                                      loudness. If you don't specify  a  value
                                      here,  the  encoder  chooses a value for
                                      you, based on  the  algorithm  that  you
                                      choose for Algorithm (algorithm). If you
                                      choose  algorithm  1770-1,  the  encoder
                                      will choose -24 LKFS; otherwise, the en-
                                      coder will choose -23 LKFS.

                               AudioSourceName -> (string)
                                   Specifies which audio data to use from each
                                   input.  In  the  simplest  case, specify an
                                   "Audio Selector":#inputs-audio_selector  by
                                   name  based on its order within each input.
                                   For example if you specify "Audio  Selector
                                   3",  then  the third audio selector will be
                                   used from each input. If an input does  not
                                   have  an "Audio Selector 3", then the audio
                                   selector marked as "default" in that  input
                                   will be used. If there is no audio selector
                                   marked as "default", silence  will  be  in-
                                   serted  for the duration of that input. Al-
                                   ternatively, an "Audio Selector Group":#in-
                                   puts-audio_selector_group name may be spec-
                                   ified, with similar default/silence  behav-
                                   ior.  If no audio_source_name is specified,
                                   then "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen  au-
                                   tomatically.

                               AudioType -> (integer)
                                   Applies  only if Follow Input Audio Type is

                               AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                                   When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input con-
                                   tains  an  ISO  639  audio_type,  then that
                                   value is passed through to the  output.  If
                                   the  input  contains no ISO 639 audio_type,
                                   the value in Audio Type is included in  the
                                   output.  Otherwise  the value in Audio Type
                                   is included in the output. Note  that  this
                                   field and audioType are both ignored if au-

                                   Settings  related  to  audio  encoding. The
                                   settings in this group  vary  depending  on
                                   the  value  that  you choose for your audio
                                   codec.

                                      settings--VBR and CBR. To select one  of
                                      these  modes,  set  the value of Bitrate
                                      control mode (rateControlMode) to  "VBR"
                                      or  "CBR".  In VBR mode, you control the

                                      ity  (vbrQuality).  In CBR mode, you use
                                      the setting Bitrate (bitrate).  Defaults
                                      and valid values depend on the rate con-
                                      trol mode.

                                          bits per sample, to choose  the  en-
                                          coding quality for this audio track.

                                      Channels -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  number  of channels in
                                          this output audio track. Valid  val-
                                          ues are 1 and even numbers up to 64.
                                          For example, 1, 2, 4, 6, and so  on,
                                          up to 64.

                                      Format -> (string)
                                          The  service  defaults to using RIFF
                                          for WAV outputs. If your output  au-
                                          dio is likely to exceed 4 GB in file
                                          size, or if you otherwise  need  the
                                          extended support of the RF64 format,
                                          set your output WAV file  format  to
                                          RF64.

                                      SampleRate -> (integer)
                                          Sample rate in Hz.

                               CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Specify  the language for this audio output
                                   track. The service puts this language  code
                                   into  your  output audio track when you set
                                   Language code  control  (AudioLanguageCode-
                                   Control)  to  Use  configured  (USE_CONFIG-
                                   URED). The service also uses your specified
                                   custom  language code when you set Language
                                   code control (AudioLanguageCodeControl)  to
                                   Follow input (FOLLOW_INPUT), but your input
                                   file doesn't specify a language  code.  For
                                   all  outputs,  you  can use an ISO 639-2 or
                                   ISO 639-3 code. For streaming outputs,  you
                                   can  also  use  any  other code in the full
                                   RFC-5646 specification.  Streaming  outputs
                                   are  those that are in one of the following
                                   output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO,  Apple  HLS,
                                   or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                               LanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Indicates  the language of the audio output
                                   track. The ISO 639  language  specified  in
                                   the  'Language Code' drop down will be used
                                   when 'Follow Input Language  Code'  is  not
                                   selected  or  when  'Follow  Input Language
                                   Code' is selected but there is no  ISO  639
                                   language code specified by the input.

                               LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                                   Specify  which  source  for  language  code
                                   takes precedence for this audio track. When
                                   you choose Follow input (FOLLOW_INPUT), the
                                   service uses the language code from the in-
                                   put  track  if  it's present. If there's no
                                   languge code on the input track,  the  ser-
                                   vice  uses the code that you specify in the
                                   setting Language code (languageCode or cus-
                                   tomLanguageCode).  When you choose Use con-
                                   figured (USE_CONFIGURED), the service  uses
                                   the language code that you specify.

                               RemixSettings -> (structure)
                                   Advanced audio remixing settings.

                                   ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                      Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping)  con-
                                      tains the group of fields that hold  the
                                      remixing  value for each channel, in dB.
                                      Specify remix  values  to  indicate  how
                                      much  of the content from your input au-
                                      dio channel you want in your output  au-
                                      dio  channels.  Each instance of the In-
                                      putChannels or InputChannelsFineTune ar-
                                      ray  specifies these values for one out-
                                      put channel. Use one  instance  of  this
                                      array  for  each  output channel. In the
                                      console, each  array  corresponds  to  a
                                      column in the graphical depiction of the
                                      mapping matrix. The rows of the  graphi-
                                      cal matrix correspond to input channels.
                                      Valid values are within the  range  from
                                      -60  (mute)  through  6.  A setting of 0
                                      passes the input  channel  unchanged  to
                                      the  output  channel  (no attenuation or
                                      amplification). Use InputChannels or In-
                                      putChannelsFineTune   to   specify  your
                                      remix values. Don't use both.

                                      Specify the  number  of  audio  channels
                                      from  your input that you want to use in
                                      your output. With  remixing,  you  might
                                      combine or split the data in these chan-

                                      final  output might be different. If you
                                      are doing both input channel mapping and
                                      output  channel  mapping,  the number of

                                   mation in the output captions metadata.  If
                                   your  output  captions format is DVB-Sub or
                                   Burn in, the encoder uses this language in-

                                   instance of captions DestinationSettings is
                                   equivalent to one captions tab in the  con-
                                   sole. Usually, one captions tab corresponds
                                   to one output captions track. Depending  on
                                   your  output captions format, one tab might
                                   correspond to  a  set  of  output  captions
                                   tracks.    For    more   information,   see

                                      rather than a captions  format.  Burn-in
                                      writes  the  captions  directly  on your
                                      video frames, replacing pixels of  video

                                          the  alignment  parameter,  the font
                                          will be justified  (either  left  or

                                          your input  captions  specify.  When

                                          the  captions  file more accurately.
                                          Choose  proportional  (PROPORTIONAL)
                                          to  make the text easier to read for

                                          pixels  from the left of the output.

                                   video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In
                                   all other cases, keep  the  default  value,

                                   TION). When you choose  Match  video  dura-
                                   tion,  MediaConvert  pads  the output audio

                                   sure  that the total duration of each audio

                                   ration  of  the video stream. After padding
                                   or trimming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                   no  more  than  one  frame  longer than the
                                   video stream.  MediaConvert  applies  audio
                                   padding  or trimming only to the end of the
                                   last segment of the output. For unsegmented

                                   tween audio and video duration will  depend
                                   on your output audio codec.

                                   For  example,  if you specify "audio_aac_1"
                                   for Audio group ID, it appears in your man-

                                   List the audio rendition  groups  that  you
                                   want  included  with  this video rendition.
                                   Use a comma-separated  list.  For  example,
                                   say you want to include the audio rendition
                                   groups that have the audio group  IDs  "au-
                                   dio_aac_1"   and  "audio_dolby".  Then  you
                                   would specify this value:  "audio_aac_1,au-

                                   with  every  video  variant.  Each value in

                                   Use this setting to control the values that
                                   MediaConvert   puts   in  your  HLS  parent
                                   playlist to control how the  client  player
                                   selects  which  audio  track  to  play. The
                                   other options for  this  setting  determine
                                   the values that MediaConvert writes for the

                                   this rendition. You might use this manifest
                                   as part of a workflow that creates  preview
                                   functions for your video. MediaConvert adds
                                   both the I-frame only  child  manifest  and
                                   the  regular  child  manifest to the parent
                                   manifest. When you don't need  the  I-frame
                                   only child manifest, keep the default value
                                   Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                                   to  also appear in this output. Choose None
                                   (NONE) if  you  don't  want  those  SCTE-35
                                   markers in this output.

                            Container -> (string)

                            M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                               MPEG-2  TS  container  settings. These apply to
                               outputs in a File output group  when  the  out-
                               put's   container   (ContainerType)  is  MPEG-2
                               Transport Stream (M2TS). In these assets,  data
                               is  organized  by  the program map table (PMT).
                               Each transport stream program contains  subsets
                               of  data, including audio, video, and metadata.
                               Each of these subsets of data has  a  numerical
                               label  called  a  packet identifier (PID). Each
                               transport stream program corresponds to one Me-
                               diaConvert  output.  The PMT lists the types of
                               data in a program along with their  PID.  Down-
                               stream  systems and players use the program map
                               table to look up the PID for each type of  data
                               it  accesses  and  then uses the PIDs to locate
                               specific data within the asset.

                               AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                   Selects between the  DVB  and  ATSC  buffer
                                   models for Dolby Digital audio.

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify  this setting only when your output
                                   will be consumed by a downstream  repackag-
                                   ing  workflow  that  is  sensitive  to very
                                   small duration  differences  between  video
                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION).  When  you  choose Match video dura-
                                   tion, MediaConvert pads  the  output  audio
                                   streams  with  silence or trims them to en-
                                   sure that the total duration of each  audio
                                   stream is at least as long as the total du-
                                   ration of the video stream.  After  padding
                                   or  trimming,  the audio stream duration is
                                   no more than  one  frame  longer  than  the
                                   video  stream.  MediaConvert  applies audio
                                   padding or trimming only to the end of  the
                                   last segment of the output. For unsegmented
                                   outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only  to
                                   the  end of the file. When you keep the de-
                                   fault value, any  minor  discrepancies  be-
                                   tween  audio and video duration will depend
                                   on your output audio codec.

                               AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                   The number of audio frames  to  insert  for

                                   multiplex buffer model.  If  set  to  NONE,
                                   this   can   lead  to  lower  latency,  but
                                   low-memory devices may not be able to  play
                                   back the stream without interruptions.

                                   instances of the program map table (PMT) in
                                   the output transport stream.

                               PmtPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) for the
                                   program  map table (PMT) itself. Default is
                                   480.

                               PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) of  the
                                   private metadata stream. Default is 503.

                               ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                   Use Program number (programNumber) to spec-
                                   ify the program number used in the  program
                                   map table (PMT) for this output. Default is
                                   1. Program numbers and program  map  tables
                                   are  parts  of MPEG-2 transport stream con-
                                   tainers, used for organizing data.

                               RateMode -> (string)
                                   When set to CBR, inserts null packets  into
                                   transport stream to fill specified bitrate.
                                   When set to VBR, the bitrate  setting  acts
                                   as the maximum bitrate, but the output will
                                   not be padded up to that bitrate.

                               Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                                   Include this in your job  settings  to  put
                                   SCTE-35  markers  in your HLS and transport

                                   (sccXml).

                                   Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the SCTE-35
                                      stream in the transport stream generated
                                      by ESAM.

                               Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the packet identifier (PID) of the
                                   SCTE-35 stream in the transport stream.

                               Scte35Source -> (string)
                                   For  SCTE-35  markers  from  your   input--
                                   Choose  Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)  if  you
                                   want SCTE-35 markers that  appear  in  your
                                   input to also appear in this output. Choose
                                   None (NONE) if you don't want SCTE-35 mark-
                                   ers  in  this  output.  For SCTE-35 markers
                                   from an ESAM  XML  document--  Choose  None
                                   (NONE).  Also  provide  the  ESAM  XML as a

                               SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                                   Inserts segmentation markers at  each  seg-
                                   mentation_time  period.  rai_segstart  sets
                                   the Random  Access  Indicator  bit  in  the
                                   adaptation  field.  rai_adapt  sets the RAI
                                   bit and adds the current  timecode  in  the
                                   private  data  bytes.  psi_segstart inserts
                                   PAT and PMT tables at  the  start  of  seg-
                                   ments.  ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point in-

                               SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                   The  segmentation  style parameter controls
                                   how segmentation markers are inserted  into
                                   the  transport  stream.  With avails, it is
                                   possible that segments  may  be  truncated,
                                   which  can influence where future segmenta-
                                   tion markers are inserted. When a segmenta-
                                   tion  style  of "reset_cadence" is selected
                                   and a segment is truncated due to an avail,
                                   we  will  reset  the  segmentation cadence.
                                   This means the subsequent segment will have
                                   a  duration  of  of $segmentation_time sec-
                                   onds. When a segmentation style  of  "main-
                                   tain_cadence"  is selected and a segment is
                                   truncated due to an avail, we will not  re-
                                   set  the  segmentation  cadence. This means
                                   the subsequent segment will likely be trun-
                                   cated  as well. However, all segments after
                                   that will have  a  duration  of  $segmenta-
                                   tion_time  seconds. Note that EBP lookahead
                                   is a slight exception to this rule.

                               SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                   Specify the length,  in  seconds,  of  each
                                   segment.  Required unless markers is set to
                                   _none_.

                               TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the  packet  identifier  (PID)  for
                                   timed  metadata  in this output. Default is
                                   502.

                               TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                   Specify the ID for the transport stream it-
                                   self in the program map table for this out-
                                   put. Transport stream IDs and  program  map
                                   tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport stream
                                   containers, used for organizing data.

                               VideoPid -> (integer)
                                   Specify the packet identifier (PID) of  the
                                   elementary  video  stream  in the transport
                                   stream.

                            M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                               These settings relate to the  MPEG-2  transport
                               stream  (MPEG2-TS)  container  for the MPEG2-TS
                               segments in your HLS outputs.

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify this setting only when your  output
                                   will  be consumed by a downstream repackag-
                                   ing workflow  that  is  sensitive  to  very
                                   small  duration  differences  between video
                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION). In
                                   all other cases, keep  the  default  value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION). When you choose  Match  video  dura-
                                   tion,  MediaConvert  pads  the output audio
                                   streams with silence or trims them  to  en-
                                   sure  that the total duration of each audio
                                   stream is at least as long as the total du-
                                   ration  of  the video stream. After padding
                                   or trimming, the audio stream  duration  is
                                   no  more  than  one  frame  longer than the
                                   video stream.  MediaConvert  applies  audio
                                   padding  or trimming only to the end of the
                                   last segment of the output. For unsegmented
                                   outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only to
                                   the end of the file. When you keep the  de-
                                   fault  value,  any  minor discrepancies be-
                                   tween audio and video duration will  depend
                                   on your output audio codec.

                               AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  audio frames to insert for
                                   each PES packet.

                               AudioPids -> (list)
                                   Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  elementary
                                   audio  stream(s)  in  the transport stream.
                                   Multiple values are accepted,  and  can  be
                                   entered  in  ranges and/or by comma separa-

                                   If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO,  MediaConvert
                                   writes  captions and data packets with Pre-
                                   sentation Timestamp  (PTS)  values  greater
                                   than or equal to the first video packet PTS
                                   (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                                   ets  with  lesser PTS values). Keep the de-
                                   fault value (AUTO) to allow all PTS values.

                               MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                                   Specify the maximum time, in  milliseconds,

                                   audio and an equivalent ID3 tag will be in-
                                   serted in the output.

                               PatInterval -> (integer)

                               PcrControl -> (string)
                                   When  set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Program
                                   Clock Reference value is inserted for every
                                   Packetized  Elementary Stream (PES) header.
                                   This parameter is effective only  when  the
                                   PCR  PID  is the same as the video or audio
                                   elementary stream.

                               PcrPid -> (integer)

                                   B-frames will be  negative,  and  a  'cslg'
                                   (composition shift least greatest) box will
                                   be included per 14496-1 amendment  1.  This
                                   improves  compatibility  with Apple players
                                   and tools.

                               Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                   When  set  to  XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2  video

                                   fourcc codes. This increases  compatibility
                                   with Apple editors and players, but may de-
                                   crease compatibility  with  other  players.
                                   Only  applicable  when  the  video codec is
                                   MPEG2.

                               PaddingControl -> (string)
                                   To make this output compatible with Omenon,
                                   keep  the default value, OMNEON. Unless you
                                   need Omneon compatibility, set  this  value
                                   to  NONE.  When you keep the default value,
                                   OMNEON, MediaConvert increases  the  length
                                   of  the  edit  list  atom. This might cause
                                   file rejections when  a  recipient  of  the
                                   output  file  doesn't expct this extra pad-
                                   ding.

                               Reference -> (string)
                                   Always keep the  default  value  (SELF_CON-
                                   TAINED) for this setting.

                            Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                               These  settings  relate to your MP4 output con-
                               tainer. You can create audio only outputs  with
                               this   container.  For  more  information,  see

                               AudioDuration -> (string)
                                   Specify  this setting only when your output
                                   will be consumed by a downstream  repackag-
                                   ing  workflow  that  is  sensitive  to very
                                   small duration  differences  between  video
                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,
                                   Default codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURA-
                                   TION).  When  you  choose Match video dura-
                                   tion, MediaConvert pads  the  output  audio
                                   streams  with  silence or trims them to en-
                                   sure that the total duration of each  audio
                                   stream is at least as long as the total du-
                                   ration of the video stream.  After  padding
                                   or  trimming,  the audio stream duration is
                                   no more than  one  frame  longer  than  the
                                   video  stream.  MediaConvert  applies audio
                                   padding or trimming only to the end of  the
                                   last segment of the output. For unsegmented
                                   outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only  to
                                   the  end of the file. When you keep the de-
                                   fault value, any  minor  discrepancies  be-
                                   tween  audio and video duration will depend
                                   on your output audio codec.

                               CslgAtom -> (string)
                                   When enabled, file composition  times  will
                                   start  at  zero,  composition  times in the
                                   'ctts' (composition time to sample) box for
                                   B-frames  will  be  negative,  and a 'cslg'
                                   (composition shift least greatest) box will
                                   be  included  per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                                   improves compatibility with  Apple  players

                               CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                   Ignore  this  setting  unless compliance to
                                   the CTTS box version specification  matters
                                   in  your  workflow. Specify a value of 1 to
                                   set your CTTS box version  to  1  and  make
                                   your  output  compliant with the specifica-
                                   tion. When you specify a value  of  1,  you
                                   must  also  set CSLG atom (cslgAtom) to the
                                   value INCLUDE. Keep the default value 0  to
                                   set  your  CTTS  box version to 0. This can
                                   provide  backward  compatibility  for  some
                                   players and packagers.

                               FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                                   Inserts  a free-space box immediately after
                                   the moov box.

                               MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                   If set to  PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD,  the  MOOV
                                   atom  is  relocated to the beginning of the
                                   archive as required for  progressive  down-
                                   loading. Otherwise it is placed normally at
                                   the end.

                               Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                                   Overrides the "Major Brand"  field  in  the
                                   output file. Usually not necessary to spec-

                               AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                                   Optional. Choose Include (INCLUDE) to  have
                                   MediaConvert  mark  up  your  DASH manifest
                                   with elements for  embedded  608  captions.
                                   This  markup  isn't generally required, but
                                   some video players require it  to  discover
                                   and  play  embedded  608 captions. Keep the
                                   default value, Exclude (EXCLUDE), to  leave
                                   these  elements  out.  When you enable this

                                   Specify  this setting only when your output

                                   and audio. For this situation, choose Match
                                   video duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In
                                   all  other  cases,  keep the default value,

                                   on your output audio codec.

                               CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                                   Use this setting only in DASH output groups
                                   that include sidecar TTML or IMSC captions.
                                   You specify sidecar captions in a  separate
                                   output  from  your  audio and video. Choose
                                   Raw (RAW) for captions in a single XML file
                                   in   a  raw  container.  Choose  Fragmented

                                   the setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                               Scte35Source -> (string)
                                   Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35
                                   markers in your input  video  file.  Choose
                                   Passthrough   (PASSTHROUGH)   if  you  want
                                   SCTE-35 markers that appear in  your  input
                                   to  also appear in this output. Choose None
                                   (NONE) if  you  don't  want  those  SCTE-35
                                   markers in this output.

                            MxfSettings -> (structure)

                               AfdSignaling -> (string)
                                   Optional. When you have AFD  signaling  set
                                   up  in  your  output video stream, use this

                                   it  in  the  MXF wrapper. Choose Don't copy
                                   (NO_COPY) to exclude AFD signaling from the
                                   MXF  wrapper. Choose Copy from video stream
                                   (COPY_FROM_VIDEO) to copy  the  AFD  values
                                   from  the  video  stream for this output to
                                   the MXF wrapper. Regardless of which option
                                   you  choose,  the  AFD values remain in the

                                   DurationMode -> (string)
                                      To  create  an output that complies with
                                      the XAVC file format guidelines for  in-

                                   MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                                      Specify a value for  this  setting  only
                                      for  outputs that you set up with one of
                                      these two XAVC profiles: XAVC  HD  Intra
                                      CBG (XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG) or XAVC 4K Intra
                                      CBG  (XAVC_4K_INTRA_CBG).  Specify   the
                                      amount  of  space in each frame that the
                                      service  reserves  for  ancillary  data,
                                      such  as  teletext captions. The default
                                      value for this setting is 1492 bytes per
                                      frame. This should be sufficient to pre-
                                      vent overflow unless you  have  multiple
                                      pages  of teletext captions data. If you
                                      have a large amount  of  teletext  data,
                                      specify a larger number.

                        Extension -> (string)
                            Use  Extension (Extension) to specify the file ex-
                            tension for outputs in File output groups. If  you
                            do  not  specify a value, the service will use de-
                            fault extensions by container type  as  follows  *
                            MPEG-2  transport  stream, m2ts * Quicktime, mov *
                            MXF container, mxf * MPEG-4 container, mp4 *  WebM
                            container,  webm  * No Container, the service will
                            use codec extensions (e.g. AAC, H265, H265, AC3)

                        NameModifier -> (string)
                            Use Name modifier (NameModifier) to have the  ser-
                            vice  add a string to the end of each output file-
                            name. You specify the base  filename  as  part  of
                            your  destination  URI.  When  you create multiple
                            outputs in the same output  group,  Name  modifier
                            (NameModifier) is required. Name modifier also ac-
                            cepts format identifiers. For DASH ISO outputs, if
                            you  use the format identifiers $Number$ or $Time$
                            in one output, you must use them in the  same  way
                            in all outputs of the output group.

                        OutputSettings -> (structure)

                               AudioGroupId -> (string)
                                   Specifies the group to which the audio ren-
                                   dition belongs.

                               AudioOnlyContainer -> (string)
                                   Use this setting only  in  audio-only  out-
                                   puts. Choose MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS)
                                   to create a file in an MPEG2-TS  container.
                                   Keep  the  default  value  Automatic (AUTO-
                                   MATIC) to create an audio-only  file  in  a
                                   raw container. Regardless of the value that
                                   you specify here, if this output has video,
                                   the  service  will place the output into an
                                   MPEG2-TS container.

                               AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                                   List all the audio  groups  that  are  used
                                   with the video output stream. Input all the
                                   audio GROUP-IDs that are associated to  the

                                   manifest.  When  you don't need the I-frame
                                   only child manifest, keep the default value
                                   Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                               SegmentModifier -> (string)
                                   Use  this  setting  to  add  an identifying
                                   string to the filename of each segment. The
                                   service  adds  this string between the name
                                   modifier and segment index number. You  can
                                   use  format  identifiers in the string. For
                                   more            information,            see

                        Preset -> (string)
                            Use Preset (Preset) to specify a preset  for  your
                            transcoding settings. Provide the system or custom
                            preset name. You can specify either  Preset  (Pre-
                            set)  or  Container  settings (ContainerSettings),
                            but not both.

                        VideoDescription -> (structure)
                            VideoDescription contains a group of video  encod-
                            ing  settings.  The specific video settings depend
                            on the video codec that you choose for  the  prop-
                            erty  codec. Include one instance of VideoDescrip-
                            tion per output.

                            AfdSignaling -> (string)
                               This setting only applies to H.264, H.265,  and
                               MPEG2   outputs.   Use   Insert  AFD  signaling
                               (AfdSignaling) to specify whether  the  service
                               includes  AFD  values  in the output video data
                               and what those values are. * Choose None to re-
                               move  all AFD values from this output. * Choose
                               Fixed to ignore input AFD  values  and  instead
                               encode the value specified in the job. * Choose
                               Auto to calculate output AFD  values  based  on
                               the input AFD scaler data.

                            AntiAlias -> (string)
                               The  anti-alias filter is automatically applied
                               to all outputs. The service no  longer  accepts
                               the  value DISABLED for AntiAlias. If you spec-
                               ify that in your job, the service  will  ignore
                               the setting.

                            CodecSettings -> (structure)
                               Video  codec  settings,  (CodecSettings)  under
                               (VideoDescription), contains the group of  set-
                               tings  related  to video encoding. The settings
                               in this group vary depending on the value  that
                               you  choose  for  Video codec (Codec). For each
                               codec enum that you choose, define  the  corre-
                               sponding  settings  object. The following lists
                               the codec enum, settings object pairs.  *  AV1,
                               Av1Settings  *  AVC_INTRA,  AvcIntraSettings  *
                               FRAME_CAPTURE,  FrameCaptureSettings  *  H_264,

                               Av1Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required when you set Codec, under VideoDe-

                                   AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  strength  of  any adaptive
                                      quantization filters  that  you  enable.
                                      The  value  that you choose here applies
                                      to Spatial adaptive  quantization  (spa-
                                      tialAdaptiveQuantization).

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-
                                      tom,  specify your frame rate as a frac-
                                      tion. If you are creating your transcod-
                                      ing  job  specification  as  a JSON file
                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert  to  use  when increasing or de-
                                      creasing the frame  rate.  We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Specify  the GOP length (keyframe inter-
                                      val) in frames. With  AV1,  MediaConvert
                                      doesn't  support  GOP length in seconds.
                                      This value must be greater than zero and
                                      preferably  equal to 1 + ((numberBFrames
                                      + 1) * x), where x is an integer value.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For  ex-
                                      ample, enter five megabits per second as
                                      5000000. Required when Rate control mode
                                      is QVBR.

                                   NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (in-
                                   teger)
                                      Specify from the number of B-frames,  in
                                      the  range of 0-15. For AV1 encoding, we
                                      recommend using 7 or 15. Choose a larger
                                      number  for  a lower bitrate and smaller
                                      file size; choose a smaller  number  for
                                      better video quality.

                                   QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  quality-defined  variable
                                      bitrate encoding with the  H.265  codec.
                                      Use  these  settings  only  when you set
                                      QVBR for  Rate  control  mode  (RateCon-
                                      trolMode).

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          Rate control mode  (RateControlMode)
                                          to  QVBR. Specify the target quality
                                          level for this output.  MediaConvert
                                          determines  the right number of bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain  the video quality that you
                                          specify. When you keep  the  default
                                          value,  AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If you prefer to specify  a  quality
                                          level,   specify  a  number  from  1
                                          through 10. Use higher  numbers  for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly  lossless  compression.   The
                                          quality   level   for   most  broad-

                                      number of macroblock  rows.  For  inter-
                                      laced  pictures, this value must be less
                                      than or equal to half the number of mac-

                                      each frame based on spatial variation of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature,  the encoder uses fewer bits on
                                      areas that can sustain  more  distortion
                                      with  no  noticeable  visual degradation
                                      and uses more bits on  areas  where  any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example, complex textured blocks are en-
                                      coded  with  fewer  bits and smooth tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,
                                      though,  that  this feature doesn't take

                                          does   with  your  video.  When  you
                                          choose Multi-pass (MULTI_PASS), your
                                          video  quality  is  better  and your
                                          output  bitrate  is  more  accurate.
                                          That  is, the actual bitrate of your
                                          output is closer to the  target  bi-
                                          trate  defined in the specification.
                                          When you  choose  Single-pass  (SIN-
                                          GLE_PASS),  your  encoding  time  is
                                          faster. The default behavior is Sin-
                                          gle-pass (SINGLE_PASS).

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you

                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-

                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion, choose Optimized interlacing  (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to  create  a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output. Keep the default value, Ba-
                                      sic interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,  MediaConvert  performs   any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized  interlacing  and  you  set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable  for optimized interlacing, Me-
                                      diaConvert automatically falls  back  to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode)  to a value other than Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to 25 fps and resamples your au-
                                      dio to keep  it  synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced,  you  can  optionally enable hard
                                      telecine (HARD)  to  create  a  smoother
                                      picture.   When  you  keep  the  default
                                      value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does  a
                                      standard  frame rate conversion to 29.97
                                      without doing anything  with  the  field
                                      polarity to create a smoother picture.

                               Codec -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  video  codec.  This must be
                                   equal to one of the enum values defined  by
                                   the object VideoCodec.

                               FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value FRAME_CAPTURE.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Frame  capture  will  encode  the  first
                                      frame of the  output  stream,  then  one
                                      frame every framerateDenominator/framer-
                                      ateNumerator seconds. For example,  set-
                                      tings  of  framerateNumerator  =  1  and
                                      framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of  1/3
                                      frame per second) will capture the first
                                      frame, then 1 frame every 3s. Files will
                                      be  named  as  filename.n.jpg where n is
                                      the 0-based sequence number of each Cap-
                                      ture.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Frame  capture  will  encode  the  first
                                      frame of the  output  stream,  then  one
                                      frame every framerateDenominator/framer-
                                      ateNumerator seconds. For example,  set-
                                      tings  of  framerateNumerator  =  1  and
                                      framerateDenominator = 3 (a rate of  1/3
                                      frame per second) will capture the first
                                      frame, then 1 frame every 3s. Files will
                                      be named as filename.NNNNNNN.jpg where N
                                      is the  0-based  frame  sequence  number
                                      zero padded to 7 decimal places.

                                   MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                                      Maximum  number of captures (encoded jpg
                                      output files).

                                   Quality -> (integer)
                                      JPEG Quality -  a  higher  value  equals
                                      higher quality.

                               H264Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value H_264.

                                   AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for
                                      this setting to have MediaConvert  auto-

                                      tization for your  video  content.  When
                                      you want to apply your quantization set-
                                      tings manually, you must  set  H264Adap-
                                      tiveQuantization  to  a value other than
                                      Auto (AUTO). Use this setting to specify

                                      choose Auto (AUTO).

                                   CodecProfile -> (string)
                                      H.264 Profile.  High  4:2:2  and  10-bit

                                      Entropy encoding mode. Use  CABAC  (must
                                      be in Main or High profile) or CAVLC.

                                   FieldEncoding -> (string)
                                      The   video  encoding  method  for  your

                                      value,  PAFF,  to  have MediaConvert use
                                      PAFF encoding  for  interlaced  outputs.
                                      Choose Force field (FORCE_FIELD) to dis-

                                   FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Only  use  this  setting when you change
                                      the default value, AUTO, for the setting
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization.  When you keep
                                      all  defaults,  excluding  H264Adaptive-
                                      Quantization   and  all  other  adaptive
                                      quantization from your JSON job specifi-
                                      cation,  MediaConvert  automatically ap-
                                      plies the best types of quantization for
                                      your   video   content.   When  you  set
                                      H264AdaptiveQuantization  to   a   value
                                      other  than  AUTO, the default value for
                                      H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization is  Dis-
                                      abled  (DISABLED).  Change this value to
                                      Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop.
                                      I-frame  pop appears as a visual flicker
                                      that can arise when  the  encoder  saves
                                      bits  by  copying  some macroblocks many
                                      times from frame to frame, and then  re-
                                      freshes  them  at  the I-frame. When you
                                      enable this setting, the encoder updates
                                      these macroblocks slightly more often to
                                      smooth out the flicker. To manually  en-
                                      able or disable H264FlickerAdaptiveQuan-
                                      tization, you must set Adaptive  quanti-
                                      zation  (H264AdaptiveQuantization)  to a
                                      value other than AUTO.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Framerate  setting  to specify the frame
                                      rate for this output.  If  you  want  to
                                      keep  the  same  frame rate as the input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to  do  frame  rate conversion, choose a
                                      frame rate from  the  dropdown  list  or
                                      choose  Custom.  The framerates shown in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions  of  fractions. If you choose Cus-
                                      tom, specify your frame rate as a  frac-
                                      tion. If you are creating your transcod-
                                      ing job specification  as  a  JSON  file
                                      without  the  console, use FramerateCon-
                                      trol to specify which value the  service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose  INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if   you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if  you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  method that you want Media-
                                      Convert to use when  increasing  or  de-
                                      creasing  the  frame  rate. We recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.
                                      This  results  in  a smooth picture, but
                                      might introduce undesirable video  arti-
                                      facts.  For  complex  frame rate conver-
                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original   cadence,   use    FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator to specify the  de-
                                      nominator  of this fraction. In this ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal number for Framerate. In this  exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator of this fraction. In this  example,
                                      use  24000 for the value of FramerateNu-
                                      merator. When you use  the  console  for
                                      transcode  jobs that use frame rate con-
                                      version, provide the value as a  decimal
                                      number  for  Framerate. In this example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopBReference -> (string)
                                      If enable, use reference  B  frames  for
                                      GOP structures that have B frames > 1.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to  5. We recommend that you have
                                      the transcoder automatically choose this
                                      value  for  you based on characteristics
                                      of your input video. To enable this  au-
                                      tomatic behavior, keep the default value
                                      by leaving this setting out of your JSON
                                      job  specification.  In  the console, do
                                      this by keeping the default empty value.
                                      If  you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                      for segmented outputs,  don't  set  this
                                      value to 0.

                                   GopSize -> (double)

                                      using a whole number of frames or a dec-
                                      imal value of seconds. MediaConvert will
                                      interpret  this  value as frames or sec-
                                      onds depending on the value  you  choose
                                      for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                                      you want to allow MediaConvert to  auto-
                                      matically  determine GOP size, leave GOP
                                      size blank and set GOP mode  control  to
                                      Auto (AUTO). If your output group speci-
                                      fies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP  size
                                      blank  and  set GOP mode control to Auto
                                      in each output in your output group.

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify how  the  transcoder  determines
                                      GOP  size  for this output. We recommend
                                      that you have the  transcoder  automati-
                                      cally choose this value for you based on
                                      characteristics of your input video.  To
                                      enable  this  automatic behavior, choose
                                      Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                      Size)  blank.  By  default, if you don't
                                      specify GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                      MediaConvert  will  use automatic behav-
                                      ior. If your output group specifies HLS,
                                      DASH,  or  CMAF, set GOP mode control to
                                      Auto and leave GOP size  blank  in  each
                                      output  in your output group. To explic-
                                      itly  specify  the  GOP  length,  choose
                                      Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                      seconds (SECONDS) and then  provide  the
                                      GOP  length  in  the related setting GOP
                                      size (GopSize).

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage of  the  buffer  that  should
                                      initially be filled (HRD buffer model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer model) in
                                      bits. For example, enter  five  megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For ex-
                                      ample, enter five megabits per second as
                                      5000000. Required when Rate control mode
                                      is QVBR.

                                   MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting only when you also  en-
                                      able      Scene     change     detection
                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines  how the encoder manages the spac-
                                      ing between I-frames that it inserts  as
                                      part  of  the  I-frame  cadence  and the
                                      I-frames  that  it  inserts  for   Scene
                                      change  detection. We recommend that you
                                      have the transcoder automatically choose
                                      this value for you based on characteris-
                                      tics of your input video. To enable this
                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty value. When you explicitly specify
                                      a value for this  setting,  the  encoder
                                      determines   whether   to   skip  a  ca-
                                      dence-driven I-frame by  the  value  you
                                      set.  For  example, if you set Min I in-
                                      terval (minIInterval) to  5  and  a  ca-
                                      dence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                                      frames of a scene-change  I-frame,  then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame. In this way, one GOP is  shrunk
                                      slightly   and   one  GOP  is  stretched
                                      slightly.   When   the    cadence-driven
                                      I-frames    are    farther    from   the
                                      scene-change I-frame than the value  you
                                      set,   then   the   encoder  leaves  all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing  the  scene  change are smaller than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                   teger)
                                      This setting to determines the number of
                                      B-frames that MediaConvert puts  between
                                      reference frames in this output. We rec-
                                      ommend that you use  automatic  behavior
                                      to  allow  the  transcoder to choose the
                                      best value based on  characteristics  of
                                      your input video. In the console, choose
                                      AUTO to select this automatic  behavior.
                                      When  you  manually  edit  your JSON job
                                      specification, leave this setting out to
                                      choose automatic behavior. When you want
                                      to  specify  this   number   explicitly,
                                      choose a whole number from 0 through 7.

                                   NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                      Number  of  reference frames to use. The
                                      encoder may use more than  requested  if
                                      using  B-frames and/or interlaced encod-

                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value

                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In

                                      MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when Rate con-
                                          trol mode is QVBR and Quality tuning

                                          complexity  of your input video, the
                                          service limits the  average  bitrate
                                          of  the video part of this output to
                                          the value that you choose. That  is,
                                          the  total size of the video element
                                          is less than or equal to  the  value
                                          you  set multiplied by the number of
                                          seconds of encoded output.

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when  you  set

                                          to QVBR. Specify the target  quality
                                          level  for this output. MediaConvert
                                          determines the right number of  bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain the video quality that  you
                                          specify.  When  you keep the default
                                          value, AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks  a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If  you  prefer to specify a quality
                                          level,  specify  a  number  from   1
                                          through  10.  Use higher numbers for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly   lossless  compression.  The
                                          quality  level   for   most   broad-

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting to specify whether this
                                      output  has  a  variable  bitrate (VBR),
                                      constant bitrate  (CBR)  or  quality-de-

                                      ture, even if repeated.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when  your  output frame rate is half of
                                      your input frame rate.  In  this  situa-
                                      tion,  choose Optimized interlacing (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each progressive frame  from  the  input
                                      corresponds  to  an  interlaced field in
                                      the output. Keep the default value,  Ba-
                                      sic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,   MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized interlacing  and  you  set  your
                                      output  frame rate to a value that isn't
                                      suitable for optimized interlacing,  Me-
                                      diaConvert  automatically  falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use  optimized interlacing, you must set
                                      Telecine (telecine) to  None  (NONE)  or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode) to a value other than  Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SceneChangeDetect -> (string)

                                      quality and is enabled  by  default.  If
                                      this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                                      detection   (TRANSITION_DETECTION)   for
                                      further  video  quality improvement. For

                                   Slices -> (integer)
                                      Number of slices per  picture.  Must  be
                                      less than or equal to the number of mac-

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless your input
                                      frame rate is 23.976 or  24  frames  per
                                      second  (fps). Enable slow PAL to create
                                      a 25 fps output. When  you  enable  slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames to 25 fps and resamples your  au-
                                      dio  to  keep  it  synchronized with the
                                      video. Note that enabling  this  setting
                                      will  slightly  reduce  the  duration of
                                      your video. Required settings: You  must
                                      also  set  Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol)  to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Softness -> (integer)
                                      Ignore  this  setting unless you need to
                                      comply with  a  specification  that  re-
                                      quires  a  specific  value. If you don't
                                      have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                                      recommend  that  you adjust the softness
                                      of your output by using  a  lower  value
                                      for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or
                                      by  enabling  a  noise  reducer   filter
                                      (noiseReducerFilter).    The    Softness
                                      (softness) setting specifies the quanti-
                                      zation  matrices  that the encoder uses.
                                      Keep the  default  value,  0,  for  flat
                                      quantization.  Choose  the value 1 or 16
                                      to use the default JVT softening quanti-
                                      zation matricies from the H.264 specifi-
                                      cation. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to
                                      use   planar  interpolation.  Increasing
                                      values from 17 to 128 result in increas-
                                      ing  reduction  of  high-frequency data.
                                      The value 128  results  in  the  softest
                                      video.

                                      zation  for your video content. When you
                                      set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a  value
                                      other  than  AUTO, the default value for
                                      H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization  is  En-
                                      abled (ENABLED). Keep this default value
                                      to adjust quantization within each frame

                                      ture, the encoder uses fewer bits on ar-
                                      eas that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                      with  no  noticeable  visual degradation
                                      and uses more bits on  areas  where  any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example, complex textured blocks are en-
                                      coded  with  fewer  bits and smooth tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.

                                      reduce I-frame pop. I-frame pop  appears
                                      as  a visual flicker that can arise when
                                      the encoder saves bits by  copying  some

                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Framerate  setting  to specify the frame
                                      rate for this output.  If  you  want  to
                                      keep  the  same  frame rate as the input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to  do  frame  rate conversion, choose a
                                      frame rate from  the  dropdown  list  or
                                      choose  Custom.  The framerates shown in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions  of  fractions. If you choose Cus-
                                      tom, specify your frame rate as a  frac-
                                      tion. If you are creating your transcod-
                                      ing job specification  as  a  JSON  file
                                      without  the  console, use FramerateCon-
                                      trol to specify which value the  service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose  INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if   you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if  you
                                      want  the  service to use the frame rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  method that you want Media-
                                      Convert to use when  increasing  or  de-
                                      creasing  the  frame  rate. We recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.
                                      This  results  in  a smooth picture, but
                                      might introduce undesirable video  arti-
                                      facts.  For  complex  frame rate conver-
                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original   cadence,   use    FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator to specify the  de-
                                      nominator  of this fraction. In this ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal number for Framerate. In this  exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator of this fraction. In this  example,
                                      use  24000 for the value of FramerateNu-
                                      merator. When you use  the  console  for
                                      transcode  jobs that use frame rate con-
                                      version, provide the value as a  decimal
                                      number  for  Framerate. In this example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopBReference -> (string)
                                      If enable, use reference  B  frames  for
                                      GOP structures that have B frames > 1.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to  5. We recommend that you have
                                      the transcoder automatically choose this
                                      value  for  you based on characteristics
                                      of your input video. To enable this  au-
                                      tomatic behavior, keep the default value
                                      by leaving this setting out of your JSON
                                      job  specification.  In  the console, do
                                      this by keeping the default empty value.
                                      If  you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                      for segmented outputs,  don't  set  this
                                      value to 0.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Use  this  setting only when you set GOP
                                      mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to  Speci-
                                      fied, frames (FRAMES) or Specified, sec-
                                      onds (SECONDS). Specify the  GOP  length
                                      using a whole number of frames or a dec-
                                      imal value of seconds. MediaConvert will
                                      interpret  this  value as frames or sec-
                                      onds depending on the value  you  choose
                                      for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                                      you want to allow MediaConvert to  auto-
                                      matically  determine GOP size, leave GOP
                                      size blank and set GOP mode  control  to
                                      Auto (AUTO). If your output group speci-
                                      fies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP  size
                                      blank  and  set GOP mode control to Auto
                                      in each output in your output group.

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify how  the  transcoder  determines
                                      GOP  size  for this output. We recommend
                                      that you have the  transcoder  automati-
                                      cally choose this value for you based on
                                      characteristics of your input video.  To
                                      enable  this  automatic behavior, choose
                                      Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                      Size)  blank.  By  default, if you don't
                                      specify GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits),
                                      MediaConvert  will  use automatic behav-
                                      ior. If your output group specifies HLS,
                                      DASH,  or  CMAF, set GOP mode control to
                                      Auto and leave GOP size  blank  in  each
                                      output  in your output group. To explic-
                                      itly  specify  the  GOP  length,  choose
                                      Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                      seconds (SECONDS) and then  provide  the
                                      GOP  length  in  the related setting GOP
                                      size (GopSize).

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage of  the  buffer  that  should
                                      initially be filled (HRD buffer model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer model) in
                                      bits. For example, enter  five  megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For ex-
                                      ample, enter five megabits per second as
                                      5000000. Required when Rate control mode
                                      is QVBR.

                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines  how the encoder manages the spac-
                                      ing between I-frames that it inserts  as
                                      part  of  the  I-frame  cadence  and the
                                      I-frames  that  it  inserts  for   Scene
                                      change  detection. We recommend that you
                                      have the transcoder automatically choose
                                      this value for you based on characteris-
                                      tics of your input video. To enable this
                                      automatic  behavior,  keep  the  default
                                      value by leaving  this  setting  out  of
                                      your JSON job specification. In the con-
                                      sole, do this  by  keeping  the  default
                                      empty value. When you explicitly specify
                                      a value for this  setting,  the  encoder
                                      determines   whether   to   skip  a  ca-
                                      dence-driven I-frame by  the  value  you
                                      set.  For  example, if you set Min I in-
                                      terval (minIInterval) to  5  and  a  ca-
                                      dence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                                      frames of a scene-change  I-frame,  then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame. In this way, one GOP is  shrunk
                                      slightly   and   one  GOP  is  stretched
                                      slightly.   When   the    cadence-driven
                                      I-frames    are    farther    from   the
                                      scene-change I-frame than the value  you
                                      set,   then   the   encoder  leaves  all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing  the  scene  change are smaller than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio

                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In

                                      MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when Rate con-
                                          trol mode is QVBR and Quality tuning

                                          complexity of your input video,  the
                                          service  limits  the average bitrate
                                          of the video part of this output  to
                                          the  value that you choose. That is,
                                          the total size of the video  element
                                          is  less  than or equal to the value
                                          you set multiplied by the number  of
                                          seconds of encoded output.

                                      QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          Rate control mode  (RateControlMode)
                                          to  QVBR. Specify the target quality
                                          level for this output.  MediaConvert
                                          determines  the right number of bits
                                          to use for each part of the video to
                                          maintain  the video quality that you
                                          specify. When you keep  the  default
                                          value,  AUTO,  MediaConvert  picks a
                                          quality  level  for  you,  based  on
                                          characteristics of your input video.
                                          If you prefer to specify  a  quality
                                          level,   specify  a  number  from  1
                                          through 10. Use higher  numbers  for
                                          greater quality. Level 10 results in
                                          nearly  lossless  compression.   The
                                          quality   level   for   most  broad-

                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion, choose Optimized interlacing  (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to  create  a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output. Keep the default value, Ba-
                                      sic interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,  MediaConvert  performs   any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized  interlacing  and  you  set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable  for optimized interlacing, Me-
                                      diaConvert automatically falls  back  to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode)  to a value other than Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SceneChangeDetect -> (string)

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to 25 fps and resamples your au-
                                      dio to keep  it  synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep the  default  value,  Enabled  (EN-
                                      ABLED),  to  adjust  quantization within
                                      each frame based on spatial variation of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature, the encoder uses fewer bits  on
                                      areas  that  can sustain more distortion
                                      with no  noticeable  visual  degradation
                                      and  uses  more  bits on areas where any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example, complex textured blocks are en-
                                      coded with fewer bits  and  smooth  tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve   your   video   quality.  Note,
                                      though, that this feature  doesn't  take
                                      into  account  where the viewer's atten-
                                      tion is likely to  be.  If  viewers  are
                                      likely to be focusing their attention on
                                      a part of the screen with a lot of  com-
                                      plex  texture,  you might choose to dis-

                                      you  enable  spatial  adaptive quantiza-
                                      tion, set the value for Adaptive quanti-
                                      zation  (adaptiveQuantization) depending
                                      on your content.  For  homogeneous  con-
                                      tent,  such as cartoons and video games,
                                      set it to Low. For content with a  wider
                                      variety  of  textures, set it to High or
                                      Higher.

                                      is set to 29.970. This field works  with
                                      the Streams > Advanced > Preprocessors >
                                      Deinterlacer  field   (deinterlace_mode)

                                      Telecine. - Hard: produces 29.97i output
                                      from  23.976  input.  -  Soft:  produces
                                      23.976;  the player converts this output
                                      to 29.97i.

                                   TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep the  default  value,  Enabled  (EN-
                                      ABLED),  to  adjust  quantization within
                                      each frame based on  temporal  variation
                                      of  content  complexity. When you enable
                                      this feature,  the  encoder  uses  fewer
                                      bits  on  areas of the frame that aren't
                                      moving and uses more bits on complex ob-
                                      jects  with sharp edges that move a lot.
                                      For example, this feature  improves  the
                                      readability of text tickers on newscasts
                                      and scoreboards on sports  matches.  En-
                                      abling  this  feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,

                                      Enables temporal  layer  identifiers  in
                                      the  encoded  bitstream.  Up to 3 layers

                                      For these outputs,  the  service  stores
                                      parameter  set  NAL  units in the sample
                                      headers but not in the samples directly.
                                      For  MP4  outputs, when you choose HVC1,
                                      your output video might not  work  prop-
                                      erly  with  some  downstream systems and
                                      video players. The service  defaults  to
                                      marking  your  output as HEV1. For these
                                      outputs, the  service  writes  parameter
                                      set NAL units directly into the samples.

                               Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value MPEG2.

                                   AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  strength  of  any adaptive
                                      quantization filters  that  you  enable.
                                      The  value  that you choose here applies
                                      to the following settings: Spatial adap-
                                      tive  quantization (spatialAdaptiveQuan-
                                      tization), and Temporal adaptive quanti-
                                      zation (temporalAdaptiveQuantization).

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the average bitrate in bits per
                                      second. Required for VBR and CBR. For MS
                                      Smooth  outputs, bitrates must be unique
                                      when rounded down to the nearest  multi-
                                      ple of 1000.

                                   CodecLevel -> (string)
                                      Use  Level  (Mpeg2CodecLevel) to set the
                                      MPEG-2 level for the video output.

                                   CodecProfile -> (string)
                                      Use Profile (Mpeg2CodecProfile)  to  set
                                      the MPEG-2 profile for the video output.

                                   DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                                      Choose  Adaptive  to  improve subjective
                                      video quality for  high-motion  content.
                                      This will cause the service to use fewer
                                      B-frames (which infer information  based
                                      on  other  frames)  for high-motion por-
                                      tions of the video and more B-frames for
                                      low-motion  portions. The maximum number
                                      of B-frames is limited by the value  you
                                      provide for the setting B frames between
                                      reference frames  (numberBFramesBetween-
                                      ReferenceFrames).

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-
                                      tom,  specify your frame rate as a frac-
                                      tion. If you are creating your transcod-
                                      ing  job  specification  as  a JSON file
                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert  to  use  when increasing or de-
                                      creasing the frame  rate.  We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  relative frequency of open
                                      to closed GOPs in this output. For exam-
                                      ple, if you want to allow four open GOPs
                                      and then require a closed GOP, set  this
                                      value  to 5. When you create a streaming
                                      output, we recommend that you  keep  the
                                      default value, 1, so that players start-
                                      ing mid-stream receive an IDR  frame  as
                                      quickly  as  possible.  Don't  set  this
                                      value to 0; that would break output seg-
                                      menting.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      Specify  the interval between keyframes,
                                      in seconds or frames, for  this  output.
                                      Default:  12  Related settings: When you
                                      specify the GOP size in seconds, set GOP
                                      mode  control  (GopSizeUnits)  to Speci-
                                      fied,  seconds  (SECONDS).  The  default
                                      value  for  GOP  mode control (GopSizeU-
                                      nits) is Frames (FRAMES).

                                   GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                      Specify the units  for  GOP  size  (Gop-
                                      Size).  If  you  don't  specify  a value
                                      here, by default  the  encoder  measures
                                      GOP size in frames.

                                   HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                                      Percentage  of  the  buffer  that should
                                      initially be filled (HRD buffer model).

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                                      bits.  For  example, enter five megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose the scan line type for  the  out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a  progressive
                                      output,  regardless  of the scan type of
                                      your  input.   Use   Top   field   first
                                      (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom field first (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD) to create  an  output  that's
                                      interlaced  with the same field polarity
                                      throughout.  Use  Follow,  default   top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to  produce
                                      outputs  with the same field polarity as
                                      the source. For jobs that have  multiple
                                      inputs,  the output field polarity might
                                      change over the course  of  the  output.
                                      Follow  behavior  depends  on  the input
                                      scan type. If the source is  interlaced,
                                      the  output  will be interlaced with the
                                      same polarity  as  the  source.  If  the
                                      source  is  progressive, the output will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field  first,  depending on which of the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                      Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraDcPre-
                                      cision)  to  set  quantization precision
                                      for intra-block DC coefficients. If  you
                                      choose  the value auto, the service will
                                      automatically select the precision based
                                      on the per-frame compression ratio.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For ex-
                                      ample, enter five megabits per second as
                                      5000000.

                                   MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                      Use  this setting only when you also en-
                                      able     Scene     change      detection
                                      (SceneChangeDetect). This setting deter-
                                      mines how the encoder manages the  spac-
                                      ing  between I-frames that it inserts as
                                      part of  the  I-frame  cadence  and  the
                                      I-frames   that  it  inserts  for  Scene
                                      change detection.  When  you  specify  a
                                      value  for this setting, the encoder de-
                                      termines   whether   to   skip   a   ca-
                                      dence-driven  I-frame  by  the value you
                                      set. For example, if you set Min  I  in-
                                      terval  (minIInterval)  to  5  and a ca-
                                      dence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                                      frames  of  a scene-change I-frame, then
                                      the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                                      I-frame.  In this way, one GOP is shrunk
                                      slightly  and  one  GOP   is   stretched
                                      slightly.    When   the   cadence-driven
                                      I-frames   are    farther    from    the
                                      scene-change  I-frame than the value you
                                      set,  then  the   encoder   leaves   all
                                      I-frames in place and the GOPs surround-
                                      ing the scene change  are  smaller  than
                                      the usual cadence GOPs.

                                   NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (in-
                                   teger)
                                      Specify the number of B-frames that  Me-
                                      diaConvert puts between reference frames
                                      in this output. Valid values  are  whole
                                      numbers from 0 through 7. When you don't
                                      specify a value,  MediaConvert  defaults
                                      to 2.

                                   ParControl -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify how the service deter-
                                      mines the pixel aspect ratio  (PAR)  for
                                      this  output. The default behavior, Fol-
                                      low   source   (INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE),
                                      uses  the  PAR from your input video for
                                      your output. To specify a different  PAR
                                      in  the  console, choose any value other
                                      than Follow source. To specify a differ-
                                      ent PAR by editing the JSON job specifi-
                                      cation,  choose  SPECIFIED.   When   you
                                      choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting, you
                                      must also specify values for the  parNu-
                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                   ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.   Use   Quality  tuning  level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel) to choose  how  you
                                      want  to  trade  off  encoding speed for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior   is  faster,  lower  quality,  sin-
                                      gle-pass encoding.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      Use  Rate  control  mode  (Mpeg2RateCon-
                                      trolMode) to specify whether the bitrate
                                      is variable (vbr) or constant (cbr).

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when  your  output frame rate is half of
                                      your input frame rate.  In  this  situa-
                                      tion,  choose Optimized interlacing (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each progressive frame  from  the  input
                                      corresponds  to  an  interlaced field in
                                      the output. Keep the default value,  Ba-
                                      sic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,   MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized interlacing  and  you  set  your
                                      output  frame rate to a value that isn't
                                      suitable for optimized interlacing,  Me-
                                      diaConvert  automatically  falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use  optimized interlacing, you must set
                                      Telecine (telecine) to  None  (NONE)  or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode) to a value other than  Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                                      Enable  this  setting to insert I-frames
                                      at scene changes that the service  auto-
                                      matically  detects.  This improves video
                                      quality and is enabled by default.

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to 25 fps and resamples your au-
                                      dio to keep  it  synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Softness -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you  need  to
                                      comply  with  a  specification  that re-
                                      quires a specific value.  If  you  don't
                                      have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                                      recommend that you adjust  the  softness
                                      of  your  output  by using a lower value
                                      for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or
                                      by   enabling  a  noise  reducer  filter
                                      (noiseReducerFilter).    The    Softness
                                      (softness) setting specifies the quanti-
                                      zation matrices that the  encoder  uses.

                                   SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep  the  default  value,  Enabled (EN-
                                      ABLED), to  adjust  quantization  within
                                      each frame based on spatial variation of
                                      content complexity. When you enable this
                                      feature,  the encoder uses fewer bits on
                                      areas that can sustain  more  distortion
                                      with  no  noticeable  visual degradation
                                      and uses more bits on  areas  where  any
                                      small distortion will be noticeable. For
                                      example, complex textured blocks are en-
                                      coded  with  fewer  bits and smooth tex-
                                      tured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                                      Enabling this feature will almost always
                                      improve  your   video   quality.   Note,

                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases

                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  scan line type for the out-
                                      put. Keep the default value, Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE)  to  create  a progressive
                                      output, regardless of the scan  type  of
                                      your   input.   Use   Top   field  first
                                      (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first  (BOT-
                                      TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's
                                      interlaced with the same field  polarity
                                      throughout.   Use  Follow,  default  top
                                      (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                      bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce
                                      outputs with the same field polarity  as
                                      the  source. For jobs that have multiple
                                      inputs, the output field polarity  might
                                      change  over  the  course of the output.
                                      Follow behavior  depends  on  the  input
                                      scan  type. If the source is interlaced,
                                      the output will be interlaced  with  the
                                      same  polarity  as  the  source.  If the
                                      source is progressive, the  output  will
                                      be  interlaced  with  top  field  bottom
                                      field first, depending on which  of  the
                                      Follow options you choose.

                                   ParControl -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify how the service deter-
                                      mines the pixel aspect ratio  (PAR)  for
                                      this  output. The default behavior, Fol-
                                      low   source   (INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE),
                                      uses  the  PAR from your input video for
                                      your output. To specify a different  PAR
                                      in  the  console, choose any value other
                                      than Follow source. To specify a differ-
                                      ent PAR by editing the JSON job specifi-
                                      cation,  choose  SPECIFIED.   When   you
                                      choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting, you
                                      must also specify values for the  parNu-
                                      merator and parDenominator settings.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                   ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On  the  con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify  an  output pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                                      that is different from your input  video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For example, for D1/DV NTSC  widescreen,
                                      you  would  specify  the ratio 40:33. In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when your output frame rate is  half  of
                                      your  input  frame  rate. In this situa-
                                      tion, choose Optimized interlacing  (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to  create  a better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each  progressive  frame  from the input
                                      corresponds to an  interlaced  field  in
                                      the  output. Keep the default value, Ba-
                                      sic interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,  MediaConvert  performs   any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized  interlacing  and  you  set your
                                      output frame rate to a value that  isn't
                                      suitable  for optimized interlacing, Me-
                                      diaConvert automatically falls  back  to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                                      Telecine  (telecine)  to  None (NONE) or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode)  to a value other than Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore this setting  unless  your  input
                                      frame  rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per
                                      second (fps). Enable slow PAL to  create
                                      a  25  fps  output. When you enable slow
                                      PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                                      frames  to 25 fps and resamples your au-
                                      dio to keep  it  synchronized  with  the
                                      video.  Note  that enabling this setting
                                      will slightly  reduce  the  duration  of
                                      your  video. Required settings: You must
                                      also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON
                                      job  specification,  set  (framerateCon-
                                      trol) to (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumera-
                                      tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                                      1.

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced,  you  can  optionally enable hard
                                      telecine (HARD)  to  create  a  smoother
                                      picture.   When  you  keep  the  default
                                      value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does  a
                                      standard  frame rate conversion to 29.97
                                      without doing anything  with  the  field
                                      polarity to create a smoother picture.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in
                                      the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                                      tions of fractions. If you  choose  Cus-

                                      without the console,  use  FramerateCon-
                                      trol  to specify which value the service
                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                                      merator and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose the method that you  want  Media-
                                      Convert  to  use  when increasing or de-
                                      creasing the frame  rate.  We  recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.
                                      This results in a  smooth  picture,  but
                                      might  introduce undesirable video arti-
                                      facts. For complex  frame  rate  conver-
                                      sions,  especially  if your source video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original    cadence,   use   FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Choose the scan line type for
                                      this output.  If  you  don't  specify  a
                                      value,  MediaConvert  will create a pro-
                                      gressive output.

                                   ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                      Use this setting for interlaced outputs,
                                      when  your  output frame rate is half of
                                      your input frame rate.  In  this  situa-
                                      tion,  choose Optimized interlacing (IN-
                                      TERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                                      quality interlaced output. In this case,
                                      each progressive frame  from  the  input
                                      corresponds  to  an  interlaced field in
                                      the output. Keep the default value,  Ba-
                                      sic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for all
                                      other output frame rates. With basic in-
                                      terlacing,   MediaConvert  performs  any
                                      frame rate conversion first and then in-
                                      terlaces the frames. When you choose Op-
                                      timized interlacing  and  you  set  your
                                      output  frame rate to a value that isn't
                                      suitable for optimized interlacing,  Me-
                                      diaConvert  automatically  falls back to
                                      basic interlacing. Required settings: To
                                      use  optimized interlacing, you must set
                                      Telecine (telecine) to  None  (NONE)  or
                                      Soft (SOFT). You can't use optimized in-
                                      terlacing for hard telecine outputs. You
                                      must also set Interlace mode (interlace-
                                      Mode) to a value other than  Progressive
                                      (PROGRESSIVE).

                                   SlowPal -> (string)
                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless your input
                                      frame rate is 23.976 or  24  frames  per
                                      second  (fps). Enable slow PAL to create
                                      a 25 fps output by relabeling the  video
                                      frames  and  resampling your audio. Note
                                      that enabling this setting will slightly
                                      reduce  the  duration of your video. Re-
                                      lated settings: You must also set  Fram-
                                      erate to 25. In your JSON job specifica-
                                      tion, set (framerateControl) to  (SPECI-
                                      FIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25 and
                                      (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                                   Telecine -> (string)
                                      When you do frame rate  conversion  from
                                      23.976  frames per second (fps) to 29.97
                                      fps, and your output scan type is inter-
                                      laced,  you  can  optionally enable hard
                                      telecine (HARD)  to  create  a  smoother
                                      picture.   When  you  keep  the  default
                                      value, None (NONE), MediaConvert does  a
                                      standard  frame rate conversion to 29.97
                                      without doing anything  with  the  field
                                      polarity to create a smoother picture.

                                   Vc3Class -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  VC3  class  to  choose the

                                      erateDenominator) and Resolution (height
                                      and width), determine  your  output  bi-
                                      trate.  For example, say that your video
                                      resolution is 1920x1080 and your framer-
                                      ate is 29.97. Then Class 145 (CLASS_145)
                                      gives you an output with  a  bitrate  of
                                      approximately  145  Mbps  and  Class 220
                                      (CLASS_220) gives you and output with  a
                                      bitrate  of  approximately 220 Mbps. VC3
                                      class also specifies the color bit depth
                                      of your output.

                               Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to
                                      keep the same frame rate  as  the  input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a

                                      uses for the frame rate for this output.
                                      Choose   INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if  you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      from  the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                      want the service to use the  frame  rate
                                      you specify in the settings FramerateNu-

                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically

                                      (FRAMEFORMER) to  do  motion-compensated
                                      interpolation.  FrameFormer  chooses the
                                      best conversion method frame  by  frame.
                                      Note  that  using  FrameFormer increases
                                      the transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify
                                      the  frame rate as a fraction. For exam-
                                      ple, 24000 /  1001  =  23.976  fps.  Use
                                      FramerateDenominator  to specify the de-
                                      nominator of this fraction. In this  ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for  transcode  jobs that use frame rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify

                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for

                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      GOP   Length   (keyframe   interval)  in
                                      frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      Optional. Size  of  buffer  (HRD  buffer
                                      model)  in bits. For example, enter five
                                      megabits as 5000000.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you set qual-
                                      ityTuningLevel  to MULTI_PASS. Optional.
                                      Specify the maximum bitrate in bits/sec-
                                      ond.  For  example,  enter five megabits
                                      per second as 5000000. The  default  be-
                                      havior  uses twice the target bitrate as
                                      the maximum bitrate.

                                   ParControl -> (string)

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-

                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                      Optional.  Use  Quality   tuning   level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how you
                                      want to trade  off  encoding  speed  for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior is faster, lower quality, multi-pass
                                      encoding.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      With the VP8 codec, you can use only the

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If  you  are  using the console, use the
                                      Framerate setting to specify  the  frame
                                      rate  for  this  output.  If you want to

                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to do frame rate  conversion,  choose  a
                                      frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or
                                      choose Custom. The framerates  shown  in

                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as  60  fps  to  30 fps. For numerically
                                      complex conversions, you can use  inter-
                                      polate  (INTERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter.

                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal  number for Framerate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateNumerator to specify the numer-
                                      ator  of this fraction. In this example,
                                      use 24000 for the value of  FramerateNu-
                                      merator.  When  you  use the console for
                                      transcode jobs that use frame rate  con-
                                      version,  provide the value as a decimal
                                      number for Framerate. In  this  example,
                                      specify 23.976.

                                   GopSize -> (double)
                                      GOP   Length   (keyframe   interval)  in
                                      frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                   HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                      Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                                      bits.  For  example, enter five megabits
                                      as 5000000.

                                   MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless you set qual-
                                      ityTuningLevel  to MULTI_PASS. Optional.
                                      Specify the maximum bitrate in bits/sec-
                                      ond.  For  example,  enter five megabits
                                      per second as 5000000. The  default  be-
                                      havior  uses twice the target bitrate as
                                      the maximum bitrate.

                                   ParControl -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify how the service deter-
                                      mines  the  pixel  aspect ratio for this
                                      output. The default behavior is  to  use
                                      the  same pixel aspect ratio as your in-
                                      put video.

                                   ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-
                                      ify an output pixel aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                                      that  is different from your input video
                                      PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parDenomina-
                                      tor is 33.

                                   ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                      Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio
                                      (parControl)  to  SPECIFIED. On the con-
                                      sole,  this  corresponds  to  any  value
                                      other than Follow source. When you spec-

                                      For  example, for D1/DV NTSC widescreen,
                                      you would specify the  ratio  40:33.  In
                                      this example, the value for parNumerator
                                      is 40.

                                   QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Use  Quality   tuning   level
                                      (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how you
                                      want to trade  off  encoding  speed  for
                                      output video quality. The default behav-
                                      ior is faster, lower quality, multi-pass
                                      encoding.

                                   RateControlMode -> (string)
                                      With the VP9 codec, you can use only the
                                      variable  bitrate  (VBR)  rate   control
                                      mode.

                               XavcSettings -> (structure)
                                   Required   when   you   set  (Codec)  under
                                   (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)  to  the
                                   value XAVC.

                                   AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                      Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for
                                      this setting to have MediaConvert  auto-
                                      matically  apply the best types of quan-
                                      tization for your  video  content.  When
                                      you want to apply your quantization set-
                                      tings manually, you  must  set  Adaptive
                                      quantization (adaptiveQuantization) to a
                                      value other than Auto (AUTO).  Use  this
                                      setting  to  specify the strength of any
                                      adaptive quantization filters  that  you
                                      enable.  If  you don't want MediaConvert
                                      to do any adaptive quantization in  this
                                      transcode,  set Adaptive quantization to
                                      Off (OFF). Related settings:  The  value
                                      that you choose here applies to the fol-

                                   EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                                      Optional.  Choose a specific entropy en-
                                      coding mode only when you want to  over-
                                      ride XAVC recommendations. If you choose
                                      the value auto,  MediaConvert  uses  the
                                      mode that the XAVC file format specifies
                                      given this output's operating point.

                                   FramerateControl -> (string)
                                      If you are using the  console,  use  the
                                      Frame  rate setting to specify the frame
                                      rate for this output.  If  you  want  to
                                      keep  the  same  frame rate as the input
                                      video, choose Follow source. If you want
                                      to  do  frame  rate conversion, choose a
                                      frame rate from the dropdown  list.  The
                                      framerates  shown  in  the dropdown list
                                      are decimal approximations of fractions.
                                      If you are creating your transcoding job

                                      console, use FramerateControl to specify
                                      which value the  service  uses  for  the
                                      frame  rate for this output. Choose INI-
                                      TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the ser-
                                      vice  to use the frame rate from the in-
                                      put. Choose SPECIFIED if  you  want  the
                                      service  to  use the frame rate that you
                                      specify in the settings FramerateNumera-
                                      tor and FramerateDenominator.

                                   FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                      Choose  the  method that you want Media-
                                      Convert to use when  increasing  or  de-
                                      creasing  the  frame  rate. We recommend
                                      using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLICATE_DROP)
                                      for numerically simple conversions, such
                                      as 60 fps to  30  fps.  For  numerically
                                      complex  conversions, you can use inter-
                                      polate (INTERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.
                                      This  results  in  a smooth picture, but
                                      might introduce undesirable video  arti-
                                      facts.  For  complex  frame rate conver-
                                      sions, especially if your  source  video
                                      has  already  been  converted  from  its
                                      original   cadence,   use    FrameFormer
                                      (FRAMEFORMER)  to  do motion-compensated
                                      interpolation. FrameFormer  chooses  the
                                      best  conversion  method frame by frame.
                                      Note that  using  FrameFormer  increases
                                      the  transcoding  time and incurs a sig-
                                      nificant add-on cost.

                                   FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                      When you use the API for transcode  jobs
                                      that  use frame rate conversion, specify
                                      the frame rate as a fraction. For  exam-
                                      ple,  24000  /  1001  =  23.976 fps. Use
                                      FramerateDenominator to specify the  de-
                                      nominator  of this fraction. In this ex-
                                      ample, use 1001 for the value of Framer-
                                      ateDenominator. When you use the console
                                      for transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                      conversion, provide the value as a deci-
                                      mal number for Frame rate. In this exam-
                                      ple, specify 23.976.

                                   FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                      When  you use the API for transcode jobs
                                      that use frame rate conversion,  specify

                                      from  17 to 128 result in increasing re-
                                      duction  of  high-frequency  data.   The

                                      will be noticeable. For example, complex
                                      textured  blocks  are encoded with fewer
                                      bits and smooth textured blocks are  en-

                                          The best  way  to  set  up  adaptive
                                          quantization  is to keep the default

                                          I-frame  pop  appears  as  a  visual
                                          flicker that can arise when the  en-

                                          setting,  the  encoder updates these
                                          macroblocks slightly more  often  to
                                          smooth out the flicker. This setting

                                          to zero, MediaConvert calculates the

                                          Specify  the size of the buffer that
                                          MediaConvert uses in the HRD  buffer
                                          model  for this output. Specify this
                                          value in bits;  for  example,  enter
                                          five  megabits  as 5000000. When you
                                          don't set this value, or you set  it
                                          to zero, MediaConvert calculates the
                                          default by doubling the  bitrate  of
                                          this output point.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs with the same field po-
                                          larity as the source. For jobs  that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-
                                          ior depends on the input scan  type.
                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      Slices -> (integer)
                                          Number  of  slices per picture. Must
                                          be less than or equal to the  number
                                          of  macroblock  rows for progressive
                                          pictures, and less than or equal  to
                                          half  the  number of macroblock rows
                                          for interlaced pictures.

                                      Telecine -> (string)
                                          Ignore this setting unless  you  set
                                          Frame  rate  (framerateNumerator di-
                                          vided  by  framerateDenominator)  to
                                          29.970.  If  your input framerate is
                                          23.976, choose Hard  (HARD).  Other-
                                          wise,  keep  the  default value None
                                          (NONE). For  more  information,  see
                                          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-telecine-and-inverse-telecine.html.

                            ColorMetadata -> (string)
                               Choose Insert (INSERT) for this setting to  in-
                               clude color metadata in this output. Choose Ig-
                               nore (IGNORE) to exclude  color  metadata  from
                               this  output. If you don't specify a value, the
                               service sets this to Insert by default.

                            Crop -> (structure)
                               Use Cropping selection (crop)  to  specify  the
                               video area that the service will include in the
                               output video frame.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Width  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               X -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle  and  the  left  edge  of  the video
                                   frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               Y -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle and the top edge of the video frame.
                                   Specify only even numbers.

                            DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                               Applies only to 29.97 fps  outputs.  When  this
                               feature   is  enabled,  the  service  will  use
                               drop-frame timecode on outputs. If  it  is  not
                               possible to use drop-frame timecode, the system
                               will fall back to non-drop-frame. This  setting
                               is  enabled  by default when Timecode insertion
                               (TimecodeInsertion) is enabled.

                            FixedAfd -> (integer)
                               Applies only if you set  AFD  Signaling(AfdSig-
                               naling)  to Fixed (FIXED). Use Fixed (FixedAfd)
                               to specify a four-bit AFD value which the  ser-
                               vice  will  write  on  all frames of this video
                               output.

                            Height -> (integer)
                               Use the Height (Height) setting to  define  the
                               video  resolution height for this output. Spec-
                               ify in pixels. If you  don't  provide  a  value
                               here, the service will use the input height.

                            Position -> (structure)
                               Use  Selection  placement  (position) to define
                               the video area in your output frame.  The  area
                               outside  of the rectangle that you specify here
                               is black.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Width  of rectangle in pixels. Specify only
                                   even numbers.

                               X -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle  and  the  left  edge  of  the video
                                   frame. Specify only even numbers.

                               Y -> (integer)
                                   The distance, in pixels, between  the  rec-
                                   tangle and the top edge of the video frame.
                                   Specify only even numbers.

                            RespondToAfd -> (string)
                               Use Respond to AFD  (RespondToAfd)  to  specify
                               how the service changes the video itself in re-
                               sponse to AFD values in the input. * Choose Re-
                               spond  to  clip the input video frame according
                               to the AFD value, input display  aspect  ratio,
                               and  output  display  aspect  ratio.  *  Choose
                               Passthrough to include the input AFD values. Do
                               not  choose  this  when  AfdSignaling is set to
                               (NONE).  A  preferred  implementation  of  this
                               workflow  is  to set RespondToAfd to (NONE) and
                               set AfdSignaling to (AUTO). *  Choose  None  to
                               remove all input AFD values from this output.

                            ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                               Specify  how  the  service handles outputs that
                               have a different aspect ratio  from  the  input
                               aspect   ratio.   Choose   Stretch   to  output
                               (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have the service stretch
                               your  video  image to fit. Keep the setting De-
                               fault (DEFAULT) to have the  service  letterbox
                               your  video instead. This setting overrides any
                               value that you specify for the  setting  Selec-
                               tion placement (position) in this output.

                            Sharpness -> (integer)
                               Use  Sharpness  (Sharpness)  setting to specify
                               the strength  of  anti-aliasing.  This  setting
                               changes the width of the anti-alias filter ker-
                               nel used for scaling. Sharpness only applies if
                               your  output  resolution is different from your
                               input resolution. 0 is the softest setting, 100
                               the  sharpest, and 50 recommended for most con-
                               tent.

                            TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                               Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes
                               outputs.  Only  enable  Timecode insertion when
                               the input frame rate is identical to the output
                               frame  rate.  To include timecodes in this out-
                               put, set Timecode  insertion  (VideoTimecodeIn-
                               sertion)  to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out,
                               set it to DISABLED. Default is  DISABLED.  When
                               the  service inserts timecodes in an output, by
                               default, it uses any  embedded  timecodes  from
                               the  input.  If  none  are present, the service
                               will set the  timecode  for  the  first  output
                               frame to zero. To change this default behavior,
                               adjust the settings under  Timecode  configura-
                               tion  (TimecodeConfig).  In  the console, these
                               settings are located under Job > Job settings >
                               Timecode  configuration. Note - Timecode source
                               under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does
                               not  affect  the timecodes that are inserted in
                               the output. Source under Job settings  >  Time-

                                   Filter -> (string)
                                      Use  Noise reducer filter (NoiseReducer-
                                      Filter) to select one of  the  following

                                          filter.   Higher   values    produce
                                          stronger filtering.

                                   SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)

                                      Speed -> (integer)
                                          The  speed  of  the  filter, from -2
                                          (lower speed) to 3  (higher  speed),
                                          with 0 being the nominal value.

                                      Strength -> (integer)
                                          Relative  strength of noise reducing
                                          filter.   Higher   values    produce
                                          stronger filtering.

                                   TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)

                                      AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                                          Use Aggressive mode for content that
                                          has  complex  motion.  Higher values
                                          produce stronger temporal filtering.
                                          This  filters  highly complex scenes
                                          more aggressively and creates better

                                      PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                                          When you set Noise reducer (noiseRe-
                                          ducer) to Temporal  (TEMPORAL),  the
                                          sharpness of your output is reduced.
                                          You can optionally use Post temporal
                                          sharpening  (PostTemporalSharpening)
                                          to apply sharpening to the edges  of
                                          your  output.  The default behavior,
                                          Auto (AUTO), allows  the  transcoder
                                          to determine whether to apply sharp-
                                          ening, depending on your input  type
                                          and  quality. When you set Post tem-

                                          ABLED),  specify how much sharpening
                                          is  applied  using   Post   temporal
                                          sharpening  strength  (PostTemporal-
                                          SharpeningStrength). Set Post tempo-
                                          ral  sharpening  to  Disabled  (DIS-
                                          ABLED) to not apply sharpening.

                                          strength       (PostTemporalSharpen-
                                          ingStrength) to define the amount of
                                          sharpening the transcoder applies to
                                          your   output.   Set  Post  temporal
                                          sharpening strength to Low (LOW), or
                                          leave  blank,  to apply a low amount
                                          of  sharpening.  Set  Post  temporal
                                          sharpening    strength   to   Medium
                                          (MEDIUM) to apply medium  amount  of
                                          sharpening. Set Post temporal sharp-
                                          ening strength to High (HIGH) to ap-
                                          ply a high amount of sharpening.

                                      Speed -> (integer)
                                          The speed of the filter (higher num-
                                          ber is faster). Low setting  reduces
                                          bit  rate  at  the cost of transcode
                                          time,    high    setting    improves
                                          transcode  time  at  the cost of bit

                                          a unique ID for each asset  you  wa-
                                          termark,  and keep a record of which
                                          ID you have assigned to each  asset.
                                          Neither  Nagra nor MediaConvert keep
                                          track of  the  relationship  between
                                          output  files  and your IDs. For OTT
                                          Streaming, create two  adaptive  bi-
                                          trate  (ABR)  stacks for each asset.
                                          Do this by  setting  up  two  output
                                          groups.  For  one  output group, set
                                          the value of Payload ID (payload) to
                                          0  in  every  output.  For the other
                                          output group, set Payload  ID  (pay-
                                          load) to 1 in every output.

                                      Preset -> (string)
                                          Enter one of the watermarking preset
                                          strings that Nagra provides you. Re-

                                          Guard File Marker watermarking (Nex-
                                          GuardWatermarkingSettings)  in  your
                                          job.

                                      Strength -> (string)
                                          Optional. Ignore this setting unless
                                          Nagra support directs you to specify
                                          a value. When you  don't  specify  a
                                          value  here,  the Nagra NexGuard li-
                                          brary uses its default value.

                               TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                   Settings for burning  the  output  timecode
                                   and specified prefix into the output.

                                   FontSize -> (integer)
                                      Use Font Size (FontSize) to set the font
                                      size of any  burned-in  timecode.  Valid
                                      values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                   Position -> (string)
                                      Use   Position  (Position)  under  under
                                      Timecode  burn-in  (TimecodeBurnIn)   to
                                      specify the location the burned-in time-
                                      code on output video.

                                   Prefix -> (string)
                                      Use Prefix (Prefix) to place ASCII char-
                                      acters  before  any  burned-in timecode.
                                      For example, a prefix of "EZ-" will  re-
                                      sult  in  the timecode "EZ-00:00:00:00".
                                      Provide either the characters themselves
                                      or  the ASCII code equivalents. The sup-
                                      ported  range  of  characters  is   0x20
                                      through  0x7e.  This  includes  letters,
                                      numbers, and all special characters rep-
                                      resented on a standard English keyboard.

                            Width -> (integer)
                               Use  Width  (Width) to define the video resolu-
                               tion width, in pixels, for this output. If  you
                               don't  provide  a  value here, the service will
                               use the input width.

          TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
              These  settings  control  how  the  service  handles   timecodes
              throughout the job. These settings don't affect input clipping.

              Anchor -> (string)
                 If you use an editing platform that relies on an anchor time-
                 code, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a timecode that
                 will  match  the input video frame to the output video frame.
                 Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or
                 (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores frame rate conversion.
                 System behavior for Anchor Timecode varies depending on  your
                 setting  for Source (TimecodeSource). * If Source (TimecodeS-
                 ource) is set to Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART), the  first
                 input frame is the specified value in Start Timecode (Start).
                 Anchor Timecode (Anchor) and Start Timecode (Start) are  used
                 calculate  output  timecode.  * If Source (TimecodeSource) is
                 set to Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) the first frame is 00:00:00:00.
                 *  If  Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Embedded (EMBEDDED),
                 the first frame is the timecode  value  on  the  first  input
                 frame of the input.

              Source -> (string)
                 Use  Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are handled
                 within this job. To make sure that your  video,  audio,  cap-
                 tions,  and markers are synchronized and that time-based fea-
                 tures, such as image inserter,  work  correctly,  choose  the
                 Timecode  source  option  that matches your assets. All time-
                 codes  are  in   a   24-hour   format   with   frame   number
                 (HH:MM:SS:FF).  * Embedded (EMBEDDED) - Use the timecode that
                 is in the input video. If no  embedded  timecode  is  in  the
                 source,  the service will use Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) instead.
                 * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the timecode  of  the  initial
                 frame  to  00:00:00:00.  * Specified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) -
                 Set the timecode of the initial frame to a value  other  than
                 zero. You use Start timecode (Start) to provide this value.

              Start -> (string)
                 Only  use  when  you set Source (TimecodeSource) to Specified
                 start (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start timecode (Start) to specify
                 the  timecode  for the initial frame. Use 24-hour format with
                 frame number, (HH:MM:SS:FF) or (HH:MM:SS;FF).

              TimestampOffset -> (string)
                 Only applies to outputs that support program-date-time stamp.
                 Use Timestamp offset (TimestampOffset) to overwrite the time-
                 code date without affecting the time and frame  number.  Pro-
                 vide  the new date as a string in the format "yyyy-mm-dd". To
                 use Time stamp offset,  you  must  also  enable  Insert  pro-
                 gram-date-time  (InsertProgramDateTime)  in  the  output set-
                 tings. For example, if the date part  of  your  timecodes  is
                 2002-1-25  and  you  want to change it to one year later, set
                 Timestamp offset (TimestampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

          TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
              Enable Timed metadata insertion (TimedMetadataInsertion) to  in-
              clude  ID3  tags  in any HLS outputs. To include timed metadata,
              you must enable it here, enable it in each output container, and
              specify  tags  and timecodes in ID3 insertion (Id3Insertion) ob-
              jects.

              Id3Insertions -> (list)
                 Id3Insertions contains the array of Id3Insertion instances.

                 (structure)
                     To insert ID3 tags in your output,  specify  two  values.
                     Use  ID3  tag (Id3) to specify the base 64 encoded string
                     and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time when  the
                     tag  should  be  inserted. To insert multiple ID3 tags in
                     your output, create multiple instances of  ID3  insertion
                     (Id3Insertion).

                     Id3 -> (string)
                        Use ID3 tag (Id3) to provide a tag value in base64-en-
                        code format.

                     Timecode -> (string)
                        Provide  a  Timecode  (TimeCode)  in  HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                        HH:MM:SS;FF format.

       --tags (map) The tags that you want to add to the resource. You can tag
       resources with a key-value pair or with only a key.key -> (string)
          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a job template

       The following create-job-template example creates a job  template  with
       the  transcoding  settings  that  are  specified  in  the file job-tem-
       plate.json that resides on your system.

          aws mediaconvert create-job-template \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --name JobTemplate1 \
              --cli-input-json file://~/job-template.json

       If you create your job template JSON file by using get-job-template and
       then  modifying  the  file, remove the JobTemplate object, but keep the
       Settings child object inside it. Also, make sure to remove the  follow-
       ing  key-value  pairs:  LastUpdated,  Arn, Type, and CreatedAt. You can
       specific the category, description, name, and queue either in the  JSON
       file or at the command line.

       To  get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       If  your request is successful, the service returns the JSON specifica-
       tion for the job template that you created.

       For more information, see Working with AWS Elemental  MediaConvert  Job
       Templates in the AWS Elemental MediaConvert User Guide.

          can use to quickly create a job.

          AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
              Accelerated transcoding can significantly  speed  up  jobs  with
              long, visually complex content.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specify  the  conditions  when  the service will run your job
                 with accelerated transcoding.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          Category -> (string)
              An optional category you create to organize your job templates.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for Job template creation.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description you create for each job template.

          HopDestinations -> (list)
              Optional list of hop destinations.

              (structure)
                 Optional.  Configuration for a destination queue to which the
                 job can hop once a customer-defined  minimum  wait  time  has
                 passed.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Optional. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can specify a different relative priority for the job  in
                     the destination queue. If you don't specify, the relative
                     priority will remain the same as in the previous queue.

                 Queue -> (string)
                     Optional unless the  job  is  submitted  on  the  default
                     queue.  When  you  set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be the
                     original  queue  to  which  the  job is submitted. If the
                     original queue isn't the  default  queue  and  you  don't
                     specify  the  destination queue, the job will move to the
                     default queue.

                 WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                     Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Mini-
                     mum  wait  time  in  minutes until the job can hop to the
                     destination queue. Valid range is 1 to 1440 minutes,  in-
                     clusive.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamp  in  epoch seconds when the Job template was last
              updated.

          Name -> (string)
              A name you create for each  job  template.  Each  name  must  be
              unique within your account.

          Priority -> (integer)
              Relative priority on the job.

          Queue -> (string)
              Optional. The queue that jobs created from this template are as-
              signed to. If you don't specify this, jobs will go  to  the  de-
              fault queue.

          Settings -> (structure)
              JobTemplateSettings contains all the transcode settings saved in
              the template that will be applied to jobs created from it.

              AdAvailOffset -> (integer)
                 When specified, this offset (in milliseconds) is added to the
                 input Ad Avail PTS time.

              AvailBlanking -> (structure)
                 Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or over-
                 laid with an image, and audio muted during SCTE-35  triggered
                 ad avails.

                 AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                     Blanking  image  to be used. Leave empty for solid black.
                     Only bmp and png images are supported.

              Esam -> (structure)
                 Settings for Event Signaling And  Messaging  (ESAM).  If  you
                 don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                 ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses
                     the  manifest  conditioning instructions that you provide
                     in the setting MCC XML (mccXml).

                     MccXml -> (string)
                        Provide your ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML  document  inside your JSON job settings. Form the
                        XML document  as  per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.  The
                        transcoder will use the Manifest Conditioning instruc-
                        tions in the message that you supply.

                 ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                     Specifies the stream distance, in  milliseconds,  between
                     the  SCTE  35 messages that the transcoder places and the
                     splice points that they refer to. If the time between the
                     start  of  the asset and the SCTE-35 message is less than
                     this value, then the transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker
                     at the beginning of the stream.

                 SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as per
                     OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the signal
                     processing  instructions  that you provide in the setting
                     SCC XML (sccXml).

                     SccXml -> (string)
                        Provide  your  ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML
                        document  inside  your JSON job settings. Form the XML
                        document   as   per   OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.   The
                        transcoder will use the signal processing instructions
                        in the message that you supply. Provide your ESAM Sig-
                        nalProcessingNotification  XML  document  inside  your
                        JSON job settings. For your MPEG2-TS file outputs,  if
                        you  want  the service to place SCTE-35 markers at the
                        insertion points you specify in the XML document,  you
                        must  also enable SCTE-35 ESAM (scte35Esam). Note that
                        you can either specify an ESAM XML document or  enable
                        SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

              ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                 If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services, en-
                 able this feature to specify what MediaConvert does with  the
                 Extended  Data Services (XDS) packets. You can choose to pass
                 through XDS packets, or remove them from the output. For more
                 information  about  XDS, see EIA-608 Line Data Services, sec-
                 tion 9.5.1.5 05h Content Advisory.

                 CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on copy and redistribution control XDS
                     packets.  If  you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be
                     changed. If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed
                     in output captions.

                 VchipAction -> (string)
                     The  action  to  take on content advisory XDS packets. If
                     you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be  changed.  If
                     you  select  STRIP, any packets will be removed in output
                     captions.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Use Inputs (inputs) to define the source  file  used  in  the
                 transcode job. There can only be one input in a job template.
                 Using the API, you can include multiple inputs when referenc-
                 ing a job template.

                 (structure)
                     Specified video input in a template.

                     AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                        Use  audio selector groups to combine multiple sidecar
                        audio inputs so that you can assign them to  a  single
                        output  audio  tab  (AudioDescription).  Note that, if
                        you're working with embedded audio,  it's  simpler  to
                        assign  multiple  input tracks into a single audio se-
                        lector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use audio  selector  groups  to  combine  multiple
                            sidecar  audio  inputs so that you can assign them
                            to a single output audio  tab  (AudioDescription).
                            Note  that, if you're working with embedded audio,
                            it's simpler to assign multiple input tracks  into
                            a  single  audio selector rather than use an audio
                            selector group.

                            AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                               Name of an Audio Selector within the same input
                               to  include  in the group. Audio selector names
                               are standardized, based on their  order  within
                               the input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio
                               selector name parameter can be repeated to  add
                               any number of audio selectors to the group.

                               (string)

                     AudioSelectors -> (map)
                        Use  Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify a
                        track or set of tracks from the input  that  you  will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify  a
                            track  or  set  of  tracks from the input that you
                            will use in your outputs. You can use multiple Au-
                            dio selectors per input.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source, using the ISO 639-2 or ISO  639-3
                               three-letter language code

                            DefaultSelection -> (string)
                               Enable  this  setting  on one audio selector to
                               set it as the default for the job. The  service
                               uses  this  default  for outputs where it can't
                               find the specified input audio.  If  you  don't
                               set a default, those outputs have no audio.

                            ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                               Specifies  audio  data  from  an  external file
                               source.

                            HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings specific to audio sources  in  an  HLS
                               alternate  rendition group. Specify the proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode)  to identify the unique audio
                               track among the  alternative  rendition  groups
                               present in the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                               is found, or multiple tracks match the  proper-
                               ties  provided, the job fails. If no properties
                               in hlsRenditionGroupSettings are specified, the
                               default audio track within the video segment is
                               chosen. If there is no audio within video  seg-
                               ment, the alternative audio with DEFAULT=YES is
                               chosen instead.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify ISO 639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                            LanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source.

                            Offset -> (integer)
                               Specifies a time delta in milliseconds to  off-
                               set the audio from the input video.

                            Pids -> (list)
                               Selects  a  specific  PID  from within an audio
                               source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                               (integer)

                            ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                               Use this setting for input streams that contain
                               Dolby  E,  to have the service extract specific
                               program data from the track. To select multiple
                               programs,  create  multiple  selectors with the
                               same Track and different  Program  numbers.  In
                               the  console,  this setting is visible when you
                               set Selector type to Track. Choose the  program
                               number from the dropdown list. If you are send-
                               ing a JSON file, provide the program ID,  which
                               is  part  of  the audio metadata. If your input
                               file has incorrect metadata, you can choose All
                               channels  instead  of  a program number to have
                               the service ignore the program IDs and  include
                               all the programs in the track.

                            RemixSettings -> (structure)
                               Use  these  settings to reorder the audio chan-
                               nels of one input to match those of another in-
                               put.  This  allows you to combine the two files
                               into a single output, one after the other.

                               ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                   Channel mapping  (ChannelMapping)  contains
                                   the  group of fields that hold the remixing
                                   value for  each  channel,  in  dB.  Specify
                                   remix  values  to  indicate how much of the
                                   content from your input audio  channel  you
                                   want  in  your  output audio channels. Each
                                   instance of the InputChannels or InputChan-
                                   nelsFineTune  array  specifies these values
                                   for one output channel. Use one instance of
                                   this  array for each output channel. In the
                                   console, each array corresponds to a column
                                   in  the  graphical depiction of the mapping
                                   matrix. The rows of  the  graphical  matrix
                                   correspond  to input channels. Valid values
                                   are  within  the  range  from  -60   (mute)
                                   through  6. A setting of 0 passes the input
                                   channel unchanged to the output channel (no
                                   attenuation   or  amplification).  Use  In-
                                   putChannels  or  InputChannelsFineTune   to
                                   specify your remix values. Don't use both.

                                   OutputChannels -> (list)
                                      In  your JSON job specification, include
                                      one child of OutputChannels for each au-
                                      dio  channel  that you want in your out-
                                      put. Each child should contain  one  in-
                                      stance  of  InputChannels  or InputChan-
                                      nelsFineTune.

                                      (structure)
                                          OutputChannel mapping settings.

                                          InputChannels -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values when they are inte-
                                             gers, such as -10, 0, or 4.

                                          InputChannelsFineTune -> (list)
                                             Use this setting to specify  your
                                             remix  values  when  they  have a
                                             decimal   component,   such    as
                                             -10.312,  0.08, or 4.9. MediaCon-
                                             vert rounds your remixing  values
                                             to the nearest thousandth.

                                             (double)

                               ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  number of audio channels from
                                   your input that you want  to  use  in  your
                                   output. With remixing, you might combine or
                                   split the data in these  channels,  so  the
                                   number  of  channels  in  your final output
                                   might be different. If you are  doing  both
                                   input  channel  mapping  and output channel
                                   mapping, the number of output  channels  in
                                   your  input mapping must be the same as the
                                   number of input  channels  in  your  output
                                   mapping.

                                   Specify the number of channels in this out-
                                   put after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2,  4,
                                   6,  8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If
                                   you are doing both  input  channel  mapping
                                   and  output  channel mapping, the number of
                                   output channels in your input mapping  must
                                   be the same as the number of input channels
                                   in your output mapping.

                            SelectorType -> (string)
                               Specifies the type of the audio selector.

                            Tracks -> (list)
                               Identify a track from the input  audio  to  in-
                               clude  in  this  selector by entering the track
                               index number. To include several  tracks  in  a
                               single  audio selector, specify multiple tracks
                               as  follows.  Using  the   console,   enter   a
                               comma-separated  list. For examle, type "1,2,3"
                               to include tracks 1 through 3.  Specifying  di-
                               rectly in your JSON job file, provide the track
                               numbers in an  array.  For  example,  "tracks":
                               [1,2,3].

                               using the ISO 639-2 or ISO  639-3  three-letter
                               language  code.  If  input is SCTE-27, complete
                               this field and/or PID  to  select  the  caption
                               language  to  extract.  If input is DVB-Sub and
                               output is Burn-in or  SMPTE-TT,  complete  this
                               field and/or PID to select the caption language
                               to extract. If input is DVB-Sub that  is  being
                               passed   through,  omit  this  field  (and  PID
                               field); there is no way to extract  a  specific
                               language with pass-through captions.

                            LanguageCode -> (string)

                                      modify  the  times in the captions file.
                                      For example, type 15 to add  15  seconds
                                      to  all  the times in the captions file.
                                      Type -5 to subtract 5 seconds  from  the
                                      times  in the captions file. You can op-

                                      liseconds  instead  of seconds. When you
                                      do so, set  the  related  setting,  Time

                                      liseconds  (MILLISECONDS).  Note   that,
                                      when  you specify a time delta for time-

                                      est frame. For example, when your  input
                                      video frame rate is 25 fps and you spec-
                                      ify 1010ms for time delta,  MediaConvert
                                      delays your captions by 1000 ms.

                                   TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                      When  you  use  the  setting  Time delta
                                      (TimeDelta) to adjust the  sync  between
                                      your  sidecar  captions  and your video,
                                      use this setting to  specify  the  units
                                      for the delta that you specify. When you
                                      don't specify a  value  for  Time  delta
                                      units   (TimeDeltaUnits),   MediaConvert
                                      uses seconds by default.

                               SourceType -> (string)
                                   Use Source  (SourceType)  to  identify  the
                                   format  of your input captions. The service
                                   cannot auto-detect caption format.

                               TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to   Teletext   caption
                                   sources, including Page number.

                                   PageNumber -> (string)
                                      Use  Page Number (PageNumber) to specify
                                      the three-digit hexadecimal page  number
                                      that will be used for Teletext captions.
                                      Do not use this setting if you are pass-
                                      ing  through  teletext  from  the  input
                                      source to output.

                               TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings specific to caption  sources  that
                                   are  specified  by track number. Currently,
                                   this is only IMSC captions in an IMF  pack-
                                   age.  If your caption source is IMSC 1.1 in
                                   a separate xml file, use FileSourceSettings
                                   instead of TrackSourceSettings.

                                   TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting to select a single cap-
                                      tions track from a source. Track numbers
                                      correspond  to the order in the captions
                                      source file. For IMF sources, track num-
                                      bering  is  based  on the order that the
                                      captions appear in the CPL. For example,
                                      use  1 to select the captions asset that
                                      is listed first in the CPL.  To  include
                                      more than one captions track in your job
                                      outputs, create multiple input  captions
                                      selectors.  Specify one track per selec-
                                      tor.

                               WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings specific to WebVTT sources in  HLS
                                   alternative  rendition  group.  Specify the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or  renditionLanguageCode)  to identify the
                                   unique subtitle track among the alternative
                                   rendition  groups  present in the HLS mani-
                                   fest. If no unique track is found, or  mul-
                                   tiple  tracks  match  the specified proper-
                                   ties, the job fails. If there is  only  one
                                   subtitle  track in the rendition group, the
                                   settings can be left empty and the  default
                                   subtitle track will be chosen. If your cap-
                                   tion source is a sidecar  file,  use  File-
                                   SourceSettings  instead of WebvttHlsSource-
                                   Settings.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                                   RenditionName -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify media name

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use  Cropping  selection  (crop)  to specify the video
                        area that the service will include in the output video
                        frame.  If  you specify a value here, it will override
                        any value that you specify in the output setting Crop-
                        ping selection (crop).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DeblockFilter -> (string)
                        Enable   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter)   to   produce
                        smoother motion in the output.  Default  is  disabled.
                        Only  manually controllable for MPEG2 and uncompressed
                        video inputs.

                     DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                        Enable Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter)  to  filter  noise
                        from  the  input. Default is disabled. Only applicable
                        to MPEG2, H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                     FilterEnable -> (string)
                        Specify how the transcoding service  applies  the  de-
                        noise  and  deblock  filters. You must also enable the
                        filters separately, with Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)
                        and   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter).  *  Auto  -  The
                        transcoding service determines whether to  apply  fil-
                        tering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable
                        - The input is not filtered. This is true even if  you
                        use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and
                        (InputDeblockFilter). * Force - The input is  filtered
                        regardless of input type.

                     FilterStrength -> (integer)
                        Use  Filter  strength  (FilterStrength)  to adjust the
                        magnitude the input filter settings (Deblock  and  De-
                        noise). The range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay on your video. Enable or disable this  feature
                        for  each input individually. This setting is disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify the images that you  want  to  overlay  on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These  settings  apply  to  a  specific graphic
                               overlay. You can include multiple  overlays  in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the time, in milliseconds, for the
                                   image to remain on the output  video.  This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify for the image insertion  and  the  time
                                   that  the  image  appears  at full opacity.
                                   Full opacity is the level that you  specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for Fade-in, the image will ap-
                                   pear abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the end of the time that  you
                                   have  specified for the image overlay Dura-
                                   tion and when the overlaid image has  faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear  abruptly  at  the end of the inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the  video  resolution  height,
                                   the  service  will crop your overlaid image
                                   to fit. To use the native height of the im-
                                   age, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion of the image that you want to  overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the  overlaid image and the top edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify how overlapping inserted images ap-
                                   pear. Images with higher values  for  Layer
                                   appear  on  top of images with lower values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use Opacity (Opacity) to specify  how  much
                                   of  the  underlying video shows through the
                                   inserted image. 0 is transparent and 100 is
                                   fully opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify  the timecode of the frame that you
                                   want the overlay to first appear  on.  This
                                   must   be   in   timecode  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF) format. Remember to take  into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the width of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service will crop your  overlaid  image  to
                                   fit.  To use the native width of the image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                     InputClippings -> (list)
                        (InputClippings) contains sets of start and end  times
                        that  together  specify  a  portion of the input to be
                        used in the outputs. If you provide only a start time,
                        the  clip  will be the entire input from that point to
                        the end. If you provide only an end time, it  will  be
                        the  entire  input  up to that point. When you specify
                        more than one input clip, the transcoding service cre-
                        ates  the  job outputs by stringing the clips together
                        in the order you specify them.

                        (structure)
                            To transcode only portions of your input,  include
                            one  input  clip  for each part of your input that
                            you want in your output. All input clips that  you
                            specify  will  be  included in every output of the
                            job.      For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                            EndTimecode -> (string)
                               Set End timecode (EndTimecode) to  the  end  of
                               the  portion of the input you are clipping. The
                               frame corresponding to the End  timecode  value
                               is  included in the clip. Start timecode or End
                               timecode may be left blank, but not  both.  Use
                               the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH
                               is the hour, MM is the minute, SS is  the  sec-
                               ond,  and FF is the frame number. When choosing
                               this value, take into account your setting  for
                               timecode  source  under  input settings (Input-
                               TimecodeSource). For example, if you  have  em-
                               bedded  timecodes that start at 01:00:00:00 and
                               you want your clip to end six minutes into  the
                               video, use 01:06:00:00.

                            StartTimecode -> (string)
                               Set  Start  timecode (StartTimecode) to the be-
                               ginning of the portion of  the  input  you  are
                               clipping.  The frame corresponding to the Start
                               timecode value is included in the  clip.  Start
                               timecode or End timecode may be left blank, but
                               not  both.  Use  the  format   HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                               HH:MM:SS;FF,  where  HH  is the hour, MM is the
                               minute, SS is the second, and FF is  the  frame
                               number. When choosing this value, take into ac-
                               count your setting for Input  timecode  source.
                               For  example,  if  you  have embedded timecodes
                               that start at 01:00:00:00  and  you  want  your
                               clip  to begin five minutes into the video, use
                               01:05:00:00.

                     InputScanType -> (string)
                        When you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF)  in-
                        put, use this setting to flag the input as PsF. Media-
                        Convert doesn't automatically detect  PsF.  Therefore,
                        flagging your input as PsF results in better preserva-
                        tion of video quality when you  do  deinterlacing  and
                        frame  rate  conversion. If you don't specify, the de-
                        fault value is Auto (AUTO). Auto is the  correct  set-
                        ting  for  all inputs that are not PsF. Don't set this
                        value to PsF when your input is interlaced.  Doing  so
                        creates horizontal interlacing artifacts.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement (position) to define the video
                        area in your output frame. The  area  outside  of  the
                        rectangle that you specify here is black. If you spec-
                        ify a value here, it will override any value that  you
                        specify in the output setting Selection placement (po-
                        sition). If you specify a value here, this will  over-
                        ride any AFD values in your input, even if you set Re-
                        spond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to Respond  (RESPOND).  If
                        you  specify  a  value here, this will ignore anything
                        that you specify  for  the  setting  Scaling  Behavior
                        (scalingBehavior).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use  Program (programNumber) to select a specific pro-
                        gram from within  a  multi-program  transport  stream.
                        Note  that Quad 4K is not currently supported. Default
                        is the first program within the transport  stream.  If
                        the program you specify doesn't exist, the transcoding
                        service will use this default.

                     PsiControl -> (string)
                        Set PSI control (InputPsiControl) for transport stream
                        inputs  to  specify  which  data  the demux process to
                        scans. * Ignore PSI - Scan  all  PIDs  for  audio  and
                        video. * Use PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                     TimecodeSource -> (string)
                        Use  this  Timecode  source setting, located under the
                        input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to  specify  how
                        the  service  counts  input  video  frames. This input
                        frame count affects only the behavior of features that
                        apply to a single input at a time, such as input clip-
                        ping and synchronizing some captions  formats.  Choose
                        Embedded (EMBEDDED) to use the timecodes in your input
                        video. Choose Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to  start  the
                        first  frame  at  zero. Choose Specified start (SPECI-
                        FIEDSTART) to start the first frame  at  the  timecode
                        that  you specify in the setting Start timecode (time-
                        codeStart). If you don't specify a value for  Timecode
                        source,  the service will use Embedded by default. For
                        more     information     about     timecodes,      see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     TimecodeStart -> (string)
                        Specify the timecode that you want the service to  use
                        for  this  input's initial frame. To use this setting,
                        you must set the Timecode source setting, located  un-
                        der the input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to Spec-
                        ified start  (SPECIFIEDSTART).  For  more  information
                        about                  timecodes,                  see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     VideoSelector -> (structure)
                        Input  video  selectors contain the video settings for
                        the input. Each of your inputs  can  have  up  to  one
                        video selector.

                        AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                            Ignore  this setting unless this input is a Quick-
                            Time animation with an  alpha  channel.  Use  this
                            setting  to  create separate Key and Fill outputs.
                            In each output, specify which part  of  the  input
                            MediaConvert  uses.  Leave this setting at the de-
                            fault value DISCARD to delete  the  alpha  channel
                            and preserve the video. Set it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to
                            delete the video and map the alpha channel to  the
                            luma channel of your outputs.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            If your input video has accurate color space meta-
                            data, or if you  don't  know  about  color  space,
                            leave  this  set to the default value Follow (FOL-
                            LOW). The service will automatically  detect  your
                            input  color  space. If your input video has meta-
                            data indicating the wrong color space, specify the
                            accurate  color space here. If your input video is
                            HDR 10 and the SMPTE  ST  2086  Mastering  Display
                            Color Volume static metadata isn't present in your
                            video stream, or if that metadata is  present  but
                            not  accurate,  choose  Force HDR 10 (FORCE_HDR10)
                            here and specify correct values in the  input  HDR
                            10 metadata (Hdr10Metadata) settings. For more in-
                            formation  about  MediaConvert   HDR   jobs,   see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/hdr.

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            There are two sources for color metadata, the  in-
                            put  file  and  the job input settings Color space
                            (ColorSpace) and HDR  master  display  information
                            settings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space  usage
                            setting determines which takes precedence.  Choose
                            Force (FORCE) to use color metadata from the input
                            job settings. If  you  don't  specify  values  for
                            those  settings,  the  service  defaults  to using
                            metadata from your input. FALLBACK - Choose  Fall-
                            back  (FALLBACK)  to  use  color metadata from the
                            source when it is present.  If  there's  no  color
                            metadata  in your input file, the service defaults
                            to using values you specify in the input settings.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that
                            is  missing or inaccurate in your input video. Ap-
                            propriate values vary depending on the input video
                            and  must be provided by a color grader. The color
                            grader generates these values during  the  HDR  10
                            mastering  process.  The  valid  range for each of
                            these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment rep-
                            resents  0.00002  in CIE1931 color coordinate. Re-

                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by  a  color grader, using color grading tools.
                               Range is 0 to 50,000, each increment represents

                            WhitePointY -> (integer)
                               HDR Master Display Information must be provided
                               by  a  color grader, using color grading tools.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Use PID (Pid) to select specific video  data  from
                            an  input  file. Specify this value as an integer;
                            the system automatically converts it to  the  hex-
                            idecimal  value.  For  example,  257  selects  PID
                            0x101. A PID, or packet identifier, is an  identi-
                            fier  for  a  set  of  data in an MPEG-2 transport
                            stream container.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Selects  a  specific   program   from   within   a
                            multi-program  transport stream. Note that Quad 4K
                            is not currently supported.

                        Rotate -> (string)
                            Use Rotate (InputRotate) to specify how  the  ser-
                            vice  rotates your video. You can choose automatic
                            rotation or specify a rotation. You can specify  a
                            clockwise  rotation of 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
                            If your input video container is .mov or .mp4  and
                            your  input  has rotation metadata, you can choose
                            Automatic to have the service  rotate  your  video
                            according  to  the rotation specified in the meta-
                            data. The rotation must be within  one  degree  of
                            90,  180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation metadata
                            specifies any other rotation, the service will de-
                            fault to no rotation. By default, the service does
                            no rotation, even if your input video has rotation
                            metadata.  The  service doesn't pass through rota-
                            tion metadata.

                        SampleRange -> (string)
                            If the sample range metadata in your  input  video
                            is  accurate,  or  if  you don't know about sample
                            range, keep the default  value,  Follow  (FOLLOW),
                            for  this  setting. When you do, the service auto-
                            matically detects your input sample range. If your
                            input video has metadata indicating the wrong sam-
                            ple range, specify the accurate sample range here.
                            When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range
                            information in the input metadata.  Regardless  of
                            whether  MediaConvert  uses the input sample range
                            or the sample range that you specify, MediaConvert
                            uses  the  sample  range  for transcoding and also
                            writes it to the output metadata.

              KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                 Use these settings only when  you  use  Kantar  watermarking.
                 Specify  the  values  that  MediaConvert uses to generate and
                 place Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These  settings
                 apply  to every output in your job. In addition to specifying
                 these values, you also need to store your Kantar  credentials
                 in   AWS   Secrets   Manager.   For   more  information,  see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

                 ChannelName -> (string)
                     Provide  an audio channel name from your Kantar audio li-
                     cense.

                 ContentReference -> (string)
                     Specify a unique identifier for Kantar to  use  for  this
                     piece of content.

                 CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                     Provide  the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret where
                     your Kantar credentials are stored. Note that your Media-
                     Convert  service role must provide access to this secret.

                 FileOffset -> (double)
                     Optional. Specify an offset, in whole seconds,  from  the
                     start  of your output and the beginning of the watermark-
                     ing. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to
                     zero.

                 KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                     Provide  your  Kantar  license  ID number. You should get
                     this number from Kantar.

                 KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                     Provide the HTTPS endpoint  to  the  Kantar  server.  You
                     should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     Optional. Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want Me-
                     diaConvert to store your Kantar watermark XML logs.  When
                     you  don't  specify  a  bucket, MediaConvert doesn't save
                     these logs. Note that your MediaConvert service role must
                     provide  access  to  this location. For more information,
                     see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

                 Metadata3 -> (string)
                     You can optionally use this field to  specify  the  first
                     timestamp  that Kantar embeds during watermarking. Kantar
                     suggests that you be very cautious when using this Kantar
                     feature,  and  that  you use it only on channels that are
                     managed specifically for use with this  feature  by  your
                     Audience Measurement Operator. For more information about
                     this feature, contact Kantar technical support.

                 Metadata4 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata5 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata6 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata7 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata8 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

              MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                 Overlay  motion  graphics  on  top  of your video. The motion
                 graphics that you specify here appear on all outputs  in  all
                 output      groups.     For     more     information,     see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                 Framerate -> (structure)
                     If  your  motion  graphic asset is a .mov file, keep this
                     setting unspecified. If your motion graphic  asset  is  a
                     series of .png files, specify the frame rate of the over-
                     lay in frames per second, as  a  fraction.  For  example,
                     specify  24 fps as 24/1. Make sure that the number of im-
                     ages in your series matches the frame rate and  your  in-
                     tended  overlay  duration.  For  example,  if  you want a
                     30-second overlay at 30 fps, you should have 900 .png im-
                     ages.  This  overlay frame rate doesn't need to match the
                     frame rate of the underlying video.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        The bottom of the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 1.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        The top of the fraction that  expresses  your  overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 24.

                 Input -> (string)
                     Specify the .mov file or series of .png  files  that  you
                     want  to  overlay  on your video. For .png files, provide
                     the file name of the first file in the series. Make  sure
                     that the names of the .png files end with sequential num-
                     bers that specify the order that they are played in.  For
                     example,    overlay_000.png,    overlay_001.png,    over-
                     lay_002.png, and so on. The sequence must start at  zero,
                     and  each  image  file  name must have the same number of
                     digits. Pad your initial file names with enough zeros  to
                     complete the sequence. For example, if the first image is
                     overlay_0.png, there can be only 10  images  in  the  se-
                     quence,  with  the last image being overlay_9.png. But if
                     the first image is overlay_00.png, there can be  100  im-
                     ages in the sequence.

                 InsertionMode -> (string)
                     Choose the type of motion graphic asset that you are pro-
                     viding for your overlay. You can  choose  either  a  .mov
                     file or a series of .png files.

                 Offset -> (structure)
                     Use  Offset  to  specify  the  placement  of  your motion
                     graphic overlay on the video frame.  Specify  in  pixels,
                     from  the  upper-left  corner  of the frame. If you don't
                     specify an offset, the service scales your overlay to the
                     full  size  of  the frame. Otherwise, the service inserts
                     the overlay at its native resolution and scales the  size
                     up or down with any video scaling.

                     ImageX -> (integer)
                        Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay and
                        the left edge of the video frame.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Set the distance, in pixels, between the  overlay  and
                        the top edge of the video frame.

                 Playback -> (string)
                     Specify  whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on a
                     loop or plays only once.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use timecode for-
                     mat  (HH:MM:SS:FF  or  HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure that the
                     timecode you provide here takes into account how you have
                     set  up  your  timecode configuration under both job set-
                     tings and input settings. The simplest way to do that  is
                     to set both to start at 0. If you need to set up your job
                     to follow timecodes embedded in your  source  that  don't
                     start  at  zero,  make sure that you specify a start time
                     that is after the first embedded timecode. For  more  in-
                     formation,    see   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediacon-

              NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  your  Nielsen  configuration.  If you don't do
                 Nielsen measurement and  analytics,  ignore  these  settings.
                 When you enable Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfiguration),
                 MediaConvert enables PCM to ID3 tagging for  all  outputs  in
                 the  job.  To  enable Nielsen configuration programmatically,
                 include an instance of nielsenConfiguration in your JSON  job
                 specification.  Even  if  you  don't  include any children of
                 nielsenConfiguration, you still enable the setting.

                 BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                     Nielsen has discontinued the use of breakout  code  func-
                     tionality.  If  you  must  include this property, set the
                     value to zero.

                 DistributorId -> (string)
                     Use Distributor ID (DistributorID) to  specify  the  dis-
                     tributor  ID  that  is  assigned  to your organization by
                     Neilsen.

              NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                 Ignore these settings unless you are using Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking.  Specify  the  values that MediaConvert uses to
                 generate and place Nielsen watermarks in your  output  audio.
                 In  addition to specifying these values, you also need to set
                 up your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every  out-
                 put in your job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently
                 with the following Nielsen versions:  Nielsen  Watermark  SDK
                 Version  5.2.1  Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine Version 1.2.7
                 Nielsen Watermark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                 ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                     Choose the type of Nielsen watermarks that  you  want  in
                     your   outputs.   When   you   choose   NAES   2  and  NW
                     (NAES2_AND_NW), you must provide a value for the  setting
                     SID  (sourceId).  When  you  choose CBET (CBET), you must
                     provide a value for the setting CSID (cbetSourceId). When
                     you  choose NAES 2, NW, and CBET (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),
                     you must provide values for both of these settings.

                 AdiFilename -> (string)
                     Optional. Use this setting when you want the  service  to
                     include an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                     provide an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide  a
                     URL  to  it here. The URL should be in the following for-
                     mat:  S3://bucket/path/ADI-file.  For  more   information
                     about  the  metadata  .zip file, see the setting Metadata
                     destination (metadataDestination).

                 AssetId -> (string)
                     Use the asset ID that you provide to Nielsen to  uniquely
                     identify  this asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear
                     watermarking.

                 AssetName -> (string)
                     Use the asset name that you provide to Nielsen  for  this
                     asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 CbetSourceId -> (string)
                     Use  the  CSID  that  Nielsen  provides to you. This CBET
                     source ID should be unique to your  Nielsen  account  but
                     common to all of your output assets that have CBET water-
                     marking. Required when you choose a value for the setting
                     Watermark  types  (ActiveWatermarkProcess)  that includes
                     CBET.

                 EpisodeId -> (string)
                     Optional. If this asset uses an episode ID with  Nielsen,
                     provide it here.

                 MetadataDestination -> (string)
                     Specify  the  Amazon S3 location where you want MediaCon-
                     vert to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip  file.
                     This  Amazon  S3 bucket must be in the same Region as the
                     one where you do your MediaConvert  transcoding.  If  you
                     want  to  include  an ADI file in this .zip file, use the
                     setting ADI file (adiFilename) to specify  it.  MediaCon-
                     vert  delivers  the  Nielsen  metadata .zip files only to
                     your metadata destination Amazon S3  bucket.  It  doesn't
                     deliver  the  .zip  files to Nielsen. You are responsible
                     for delivering the metadata .zip files to Nielsen.

                 SourceId -> (integer)
                     Use the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source  ID
                     should  be  unique  to your Nielsen account but common to
                     all of your  output  assets.  Required  for  all  Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. This ID should be unique to your
                     Nielsen account but common to all of your output  assets.
                     Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                     Required.  Specify  whether  your  source content already
                     contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this
                     value to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service fails the
                     job. Nielsen requires that you add non-linear  watermark-
                     ing  to  only  clean  content  that  doesn't already have
                     non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

                 TicServerUrl -> (string)
                     Specify the endpoint for the TIC server that you have de-
                     ployed  and configured in the AWS Cloud. Required for all
                     Nielsen non-linear watermarking. MediaConvert can't  con-
                     nect  directly to a TIC server. Instead, you must use API
                     Gateway to provide a RESTful interface between  MediaCon-
                     vert  and  a  TIC  server that you deploy in your AWS ac-
                     count. For more information on deploying a TIC server  in
                     your  AWS  account  and the required API Gateway, contact
                     Nielsen support.

                 UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                     To create assets that have the same TIC  values  in  each
                     audio   track,   keep   the   default  value  Share  TICs
                     (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK). To create assets that have  unique
                     TIC  values  for each audio track, choose Use unique TICs
                     (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

              OutputGroups -> (list)
                 (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for each set of
                 outputs  that  share  a  common  package type. All unpackaged
                 files (MPEG-4, MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF, and  no  container)
                 are  grouped  in  a  single output group as well. Required in
                 (OutputGroups) is a group of settings that apply to the whole
                 group.  This required object depends on the value you set for
                 (Type) under (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings). Type, set-
                 tings object pairs are as follows. * FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS, Fi-
                 leGroupSettings  *  HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,  HlsGroupSettings   *
                 DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,        DashIsoGroupSettings        *
                 MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,       MsSmoothGroupSettings       *
                 CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS, CmafGroupSettings

                 (structure)
                     Group of outputs

                     AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                        Use  automated  encoding  to  have MediaConvert choose
                        your encoding settings for you, based on  characteris-
                        tics of your input video.

                        AbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up the
                            renditions in your ABR package for  you  automati-
                            cally,  based  on  characteristics  of  your input
                            video. This feature optimizes video quality  while
                            minimizing the overall size of your ABR package.

                            MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional.  The  maximum target bit rate used in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               an upper limit on the bandwidth consumed by the
                               highest-quality rendition. This is  the  rendi-
                               tion  that  is  delivered  to  viewers with the
                               fastest  internet  connections.  If  you  don't
                               specify a value, MediaConvert uses 8,000,000 (8
                               mb/s) by default.

                            MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum number of renditions that
                               MediaConvert  will create in your automated ABR
                               stack. The number of renditions  is  determined
                               automatically,  based  on analysis of each job,
                               but will never exceed this limit. When you  set
                               this  to  Auto in the console, which is equiva-
                               lent to excluding it from your JSON job  speci-
                               fication,  MediaConvert  defaults to a limit of
                               15.

                            MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional. The minimum target  bitrate  used  in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               a lower limit on the bitrate of video delivered
                               to  viewers  with slow internet connections. If
                               you don't specify a  value,  MediaConvert  uses
                               600,000 (600 kb/s) by default.

                     CustomName -> (string)
                        Use  Custom  Group Name (CustomName) to specify a name
                        for the output group. This value is displayed  on  the
                        console  and  can make your job settings JSON more hu-
                        man-readable. It does not affect your outputs. Use  up
                        to twelve characters that are either letters, numbers,
                        spaces, or underscores.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Name of the output group

                     OutputGroupSettings -> (structure)
                        Output Group settings, including type

                        CmafGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your CMAF output package.  For
                            more                information,               see

                            When you work directly in your JSON job specifica-
                            tion, include this object and any  required  chil-
                            dren when you set Type, under OutputGroupSettings,
                            to CMAF_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top -level .mpd DASH
                               manifest for each CMAF  output  group  in  your
                               job.  These  default  manifests reference every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional  top-level  manifests  that  reference a
                               subset of the  outputs  in  the  output  group,
                               specify  a  list  of  them here. For each addi-
                               tional manifest that you specify,  the  service
                               creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for each pair of HLS
                                   and DASH additional manifests that you want
                                   the  service to generate for this CMAF out-
                                   put group. Each pair of manifests can  ref-
                                   erence a different subset of outputs in the
                                   group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  HLS  group is
                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8. For HLS output groups,  spec-
                                      ify  a manifestNameModifier that is dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put.  The  service  uses the output name
                                      modifier to create unique names for  the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this
                                      additional top-level manifest to  refer-
                                      ence.

                                      (string)

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in the
                               manifest file at the top level BaseURL element.
                               Can  be  used  if  streams are delivered from a
                               different URL than the manifest file.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable this setting only  when  your  workflow
                               requires  the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag. Other-
                               wise, keep the default value Enabled  (ENABLED)
                               and  control caching in your video distribution
                               set up. For example, use the Cache-Control http
                               header.

                            CodecSpecification -> (string)
                               Specification  to  use (RFC-6381 or the default
                               RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-
                                          put.

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings for how your  job  outputs  are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses data keys to en-
                                          crypt your  content.  AWS  also  en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then  stores the encrypted data keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use  this  setting  to specify which
                                          AWS service  manages  the  CMK.  For
                                          simplest  set  up,  choose Amazon S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If  you
                                          want  your  master key to be managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose  AWS KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).  By  default,  when   you
                                          choose  AWS  KMS,  KMS  uses the AWS
                                          managed customer  master  key  (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your data keys. You  can  optionally
                                          choose  to specify a different, cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the key for the setting  KMS  ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated  data  (AAD)  to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption
                                          context,                        see:

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               DRM settings.

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented by a 32-character  text  string.  If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Specify the encryption scheme that you want
                                   the service to  use  when  encrypting  your
                                   CMAF  segments.  Choose  AES-CBC  subsample
                                   (SAMPLE-AES) or AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   When you use DRM with CMAF outputs,  choose
                                   whether  the service writes the 128-bit en-
                                   cryption initialization vector in  the  HLS
                                   and DASH manifests.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your  output  group  type  is CMAF, use
                                   these settings when  doing  DRM  encryption
                                   with  a  SPEKE-compliant  key  provider. If
                                   your output group type is HLS, DASH, or Mi-
                                   crosoft  Smooth,  use  the SpekeKeyProvider
                                   settings instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys that it provides to Me-
                                      diaConvert, set up a certificate with  a
                                      master  key  using  AWS Certificate Man-
                                      ager. Specify the  certificate's  Amazon
                                      Resource Name (ARN) here.

                                   DashSignaledSystemIds -> (list)
                                      Specify the DRM system IDs that you want
                                      signaled in the DASH manifest that Medi-
                                      aConvert  creates  as  part of this CMAF
                                      package. The DASH manifest can currently
                                      signal  up to three system IDs. For more

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length,  in whole seconds, of the
                               mp4 fragments. When you don't specify a  value,
                               MediaConvert  defaults  to  2. Related setting:
                               Use Fragment length control (FragmentLengthCon-
                               trol)  to  specify whether the encoder enforces
                               this value strictly.

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert  generates  images
                               for  trick  play.  Keep the default value, None
                               (NONE), to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose
                               Thumbnail  (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled thumb-
                               nails. Choose Thumbnail and full frame  (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)  to  generate  tiled thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames.  When  you  enable  Write  HLS manifest
                               (WriteHlsManifest),  MediaConvert   creates   a
                               child  manifest for each set of images that you
                               generate and adds corresponding entries to  the
                               parent  manifest.  When  you  enable Write DASH
                               manifest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds
                               an  entry  in the .mpd manifest for each set of
                               images that you generate. A common  application
                               for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumb-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job  will be rejected. Must be divisible by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates  whether  the  output manifest should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum time of initially buffered  media  that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set. If you know that player devices are  hang-
                               ing  on the final segment of your video because
                               the length of your final segment is too  short,
                               use  this  setting  to  specify a minimum final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is  greater  than  or  equal to 1 and less than
                               your segment length. When you specify  a  value
                               for  this setting, the encoder will combine any
                               final segment that is shorter than  the  length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example, your segment length is 3  seconds  and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum final segment length;  when  you  set  the
                               minimum  final  segment length to 1, your final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify whether your DASH profile is  on-demand
                               or   main.   When   you   choose  Main  profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd DASH manifest. When you  choose  On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),    the   service   signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your  .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must
                               also set the output group setting Segment  con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when  your  output  video
                               stream  has  B-frames, which causes the initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the  initial  decode  time stamp (DTS). Specify
                               how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing  time
                               stamps  in  output DASH manifests. Choose Match
                               initial PTS (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when  you  want
                               MediaConvert  to  use  the  initial  PTS as the
                               first  time  stamp  in  the  manifest.   Choose
                               Zero-based  (ZERO_BASED)  to  have MediaConvert
                               ignore the initial PTS in the video stream  and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames,  the  time  stamps in your DASH mani-
                               fests start at zero regardless of  your  choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing  the  Fragment  Length  and Segment Length.
                               When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each

                               Segment length  control  (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to  specify  whether  the encoder enforces this
                               value strictly. Use Segment  control  (CmafSeg-
                               mentControl)  to  specify  whether MediaConvert
                               creates separate segment files or  one  content
                               file  that  has  metadata  to  mark the segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact (EXACT) to
                               have the encoder use the exact length that  you
                               specify  with  the setting Segment length (Seg-
                               mentLength).  This  might   result   in   extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for

                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is always rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  above its current value in seconds. When
                               set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target  du-
                               ration  is  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration is always longer than the  actual  dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-

                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                               approximate. The segment  duration  information
                               appears  in  the duration attribute of the Seg-

                               By default, the service creates one  .mpd  DASH
                               manifest for each DASH ISO output group in your
                               job. This  default  manifest  references  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional DASH manifests that reference  a  subset
                               of  the  outputs in the output group, specify a

                                   generate for this output group. Each  mani-
                                   fest  can  reference  a different subset of
                                   outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of

                                      group. For example, say that the default

                               Use this setting only when your audio codec  is
                               a  Dolby  one  (AC3,  EAC3,  or Atmos) and your
                               downstream workflow  requires  that  your  DASH
                               manifest  use  the  Dolby channel configuration
                               tag, rather than the MPEG one. For example, you
                               might  need  to use this to make dynamic ad in-
                               sertion work. Specify which audio channel  con-

                               FIGURATION), to have MediaConvert  write  this:
                               urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.
                               Choose Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHAN-
                               NEL_CONFIGURATION)  to  have MediaConvert write
                               this                                   instead:

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A partial URI prefix that will be  put  in  the

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                               PlaybackDeviceCompatibility -> (string)
                                   This setting can improve the  compatibility
                                   of  your output with video players on obso-
                                   lete devices. It applies only to DASH H.264
                                   outputs  with  DRM encryption. Choose Unen-
                                   crypted SEI (UNENCRYPTED_SEI) only to  cor-
                                   rect  problems  with  playback on older de-
                                   vices. Otherwise, keep the default  setting
                                   CENC  v1  (CENC_V1).  If  you  choose Unen-
                                   crypted SEI, for that output,  the  service
                                   will  exclude the access unit delimiter and
                                   will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth,  use these settings when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key  provider. If your output group type is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys that it provides to Me-
                                      diaConvert,  set up a certificate with a

                                   ResourceId -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  resource  ID   that   your
                                      SPEKE-compliant  key  provider  uses  to
                                      identify this content.

                                   SystemIds -> (list)
                                      Relates  to  SPEKE  implementation.  DRM

                                      support a max of two system  ids.  Other
                                      group  types  support one system id. See

                                      (string)

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify  the  URL to the key server that
                                      your SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key  provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your
                                      content.

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length of fragments to generate  (in  seconds).
                               Fragment  length  must  be  compatible with GOP
                               size and Framerate. Note  that  fragments  will
                               end  on  the next keyframe after this number of
                               seconds,  so  actual  fragment  length  may  be
                               longer.  When  Emit Single File is checked, the
                               fragmentation is internal to  a  single  output
                               file and it does not cause the creation of many
                               output files as in other output types.

                            HbbtvCompliance -> (string)

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify whether MediaConvert  generates  images
                               for  trick  play.  Keep the default value, None
                               (NONE), to  not  generate  any  images.  Choose
                               Thumbnail  (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled thumb-
                               nails. Choose Thumbnail and full frame  (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME)  to  generate  tiled thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames.  MediaConvert adds an entry in the .mpd

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating  thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert generates thumbnails for  each
                                   IDR  frame  in the output (matching the GOP
                                   cadence). If set to  FOLLOW_CUSTOM,  Media-
                                   Convert  generates  thumbnails according to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job will be rejected. Must be divisible  by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum time of initially buffered  media  that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set. If you know that player devices are  hang-
                               ing  on the final segment of your video because
                               the length of your final segment is too  short,
                               use  this  setting  to  specify a minimum final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is  greater  than  or  equal to 1 and less than
                               your segment length. When you specify  a  value
                               for  this setting, the encoder will combine any
                               final segment that is shorter than  the  length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example, your segment length is 3  seconds  and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum final segment length;  when  you  set  the
                               minimum  final  segment length to 1, your final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify whether your DASH profile is  on-demand
                               or   main.   When   you   choose  Main  profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd DASH manifest. When you  choose  On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),    the   service   signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your  .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you must
                               also set the output group setting Segment  con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use this setting only when  your  output  video
                               stream  has  B-frames, which causes the initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the  initial  decode  time stamp (DTS). Specify
                               how MediaConvert handles PTS when writing  time
                               stamps  in  output DASH manifests. Choose Match
                               initial PTS (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when  you  want
                               MediaConvert  to  use  the  initial  PTS as the
                               first  time  stamp  in  the  manifest.   Choose
                               Zero-based  (ZERO_BASED)  to  have MediaConvert
                               ignore the initial PTS in the video stream  and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames,  the  time  stamps in your DASH mani-
                               fests start at zero regardless of  your  choice

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When  set  to SINGLE_FILE, a single output file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing  the  Fragment  Length  and Segment Length.
                               When set to SEGMENTED_FILES,  separate  segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  length, in whole seconds, of each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert  defaults  to 30. Related settings: Use
                               Segment length  control  (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to  specify  whether  the encoder enforces this
                               value    strictly.    Use    Segment    control
                               (DashIsoSegmentControl)  to specify whether Me-
                               diaConvert creates separate  segment  files  or
                               one  content file that has metadata to mark the
                               segment boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify how you want MediaConvert to  determine
                               the  segment  length.  Choose  Exact (EXACT) to
                               have the encoder use the exact length that  you
                               specify  with  the setting Segment length (Seg-
                               mentLength).  This  might   result   in   extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)
                               If  you get an HTTP error in the 400 range when
                               you play back your  DASH  output,  enable  this
                               setting  and  run  your  transcoding job again.
                               When  you  enable  this  setting,  the  service
                               writes  precise  segment  durations in the DASH
                               manifest. The segment duration information  ap-
                               pears  inside  the SegmentTimeline element, in-
                               side  SegmentTemplate  at  the   Representation
                               level.  When you don't enable this setting, the
                               service writes approximate segment durations in
                               your DASH manifest.

                        FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your File output group. Media-
                            Convert uses this group of settings to generate  a
                            single  standalone  file,  rather than a streaming
                            package. When you work directly in your  JSON  job
                            specification,  include  this  object  and any re-
                            quired children when you set Type,  under  Output-
                            GroupSettings, to FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  how  your job outputs are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                          of  the  key for the setting KMS ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8

                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set

                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                        HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)

                               By  default,  the service creates one top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS output group in
                               your  job. This default manifest references ev-
                               ery output in the output group. To create addi-
                               tional  top-level  manifests  that  reference a
                               subset of the  outputs  in  the  output  group,
                               specify a list of them here.

                                   erate  for this output group. Each manifest
                                   can reference a different subset of outputs
                                   in the group.

                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable  this  setting  only when your workflow
                               requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag.  Other-

                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will

                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-

                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            DirectoryStructure -> (string)
                               Indicates whether segments should be placed  in
                               subdirectories.

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented by a 32-character  text  string.  If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Encrypts  the  segments  with the given en-
                                   cryption scheme. Leave  blank  to  disable.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job will be rejected. Must be divisible  by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the  output  manifest  should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set. If you know that player devices are  hang-
                               ing  on the final segment of your video because
                               the length of your final segment is too  short,
                               use  this  setting  to  specify a minimum final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is  greater  than  or  equal to 1 and less than
                               your segment length. When you specify  a  value
                               for  this setting, the encoder will combine any
                               final segment that is shorter than  the  length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example, your segment length is 3  seconds  and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum final segment length;  when  you  set  the
                               minimum  final  segment length to 1, your final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                               When set, Minimum Segment Size is  enforced  by
                               looking  ahead  and  back  within the specified
                               range for a nearby avail and extending the seg-
                               ment size if needed.

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               Indicates   whether  the  .m3u8  manifest  file
                               should be generated for this HLS output group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag  in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is cal-
                               culated as follows: either the program date and
                               time  are  initialized using the input timecode
                               source, or the time is  initialized  using  the
                               input  timecode source and the date is initial-
                               ized using the timestamp_offset.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period of insertion of  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               entry, in seconds.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)

                               playback.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use

                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Number of segments to write to  a  subdirectory
                               before  starting  a new one. directoryStructure
                               must be SINGLE_DIRECTORY for  this  setting  to
                               have an effect.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include  or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute for
                               video in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant  mani-

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is always rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  above its current value in seconds. When
                               set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target  du-
                               ration  is  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration is always longer than the  actual  dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-
                               perience interrupted playback when  the  actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Indicates ID3 frame that has the timecode.

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Timed Metadata interval in seconds.

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides an extra millisecond delta  offset  to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                               soft Smooth Streaming output group in your job.
                               This default manifest references  every  output
                               in the output group. To create additional mani-
                               fests that reference a subset of the outputs in
                               the output group, specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional Mi-
                                   crosoft Smooth Streaming manifest that  you
                                   want  the service to generate for this out-
                                   put group. Each manifest  can  reference  a
                                   different subset of outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for your Microsoft  Smooth
                                      group  is  film-name.ismv.  If you enter
                                      "-no-premium" for this setting, then the
                                      file name the service generates for this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.ismv.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this
                                      additional top-level manifest to  refer-

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-

                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set

                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                               output.  (AudioDescriptions) can contain multi-
                               ple groups of encoding settings.

                               (structure)
                                   Settings related to one audio  tab  on  the
                                   MediaConvert  console. In your job JSON, an
                                   instance of AudioDescription is  equivalent
                                   to  one  audio tab in the console. Usually,
                                   one audio tab corresponds to one output au-
                                   dio track. Depending on how you set up your
                                   input audio selectors and whether  you  use
                                   audio  selector  groups,  one audio tab can
                                   correspond  to  a  group  of  output  audio
                                   tracks.

                                   AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                      When  you  mimic  a  multi-channel audio
                                      layout   with   multiple    mono-channel
                                      tracks,  you can tag each channel layout
                                      manually. For example, you would tag the
                                      tracks  that  contain  your left, right,
                                      and center audio with  Left  (L),  Right
                                      (R),  and Center (C), respectively. When
                                      you don't specify a value,  MediaConvert
                                      labels  your  track as Center (C) by de-
                                      fault. To use audio layout tagging, your
                                      output  must  be  in  a QuickTime (.mov)
                                      container; your audio codec must be AAC,
                                      WAV,  or  AIFF; and you must set up your
                                      audio track to have only one channel.

                                      ChannelTag -> (string)
                                          You  can  add   a   tag   for   this
                                          mono-channel  audio  track  to mimic
                                          its  placement  in  a  multi-channel
                                          layout.  For  example, if this track
                                          is the left surround channel, choose
                                          Left surround (LS).

                                   AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                                      Advanced  audio  normalization settings.
                                      Ignore these settings unless you need to

                                      Settings  related to audio encoding. The
                                      settings in this group vary depending on
                                      the value that you choose for your audio
                                      codec.

                                      AacSettings -> (structure)
                                          Required when you set (Codec)  under

                                          to the value AAC.  The  service  ac-
                                          cepts  one of two mutually exclusive
                                          groups of AAC settings--VBR and CBR.
                                          To  select  one  of these modes, set
                                          the value of  Bitrate  control  mode
                                          (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR".
                                          In VBR mode, you control  the  audio
                                          quality with the setting VBR quality
                                          (vbrQuality). In CBR mode,  you  use
                                          the  setting  Bitrate (bitrate). De-
                                          faults and valid  values  depend  on
                                          the rate control mode.

                                             must contain pre-mixed audio; the

                                             audio  +  audio description (AD).
                                             In this case,  the  encoder  will
                                             use  any  values  you provide for
                                             AudioType  and  FollowInputAudio-

                                          to a column in the graphical  depic-
                                          tion of the mapping matrix. The rows
                                          of the graphical  matrix  correspond
                                          to  input channels. Valid values are
                                          within the  range  from  -60  (mute)
                                          through 6. A setting of 0 passes the

                                          your remix values. Don't use both.

                                      formats, the encoder puts this  language
                                      information in the output captions meta-
                                      data. If your output captions format  is
                                      DVB-Sub  or  Burn  in,  the encoder uses
                                      this language information when automati-

                                      puts,  you  can  use an ISO 639-2 or ISO
                                      639-3 code. For streaming  outputs,  you

                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-

                                      want included with this video rendition.
                                      Use a comma-separated list. For example,
                                      say you want to include the audio rendi-
                                      tion groups that have  the  audio  group

                                      Then you would specify this value:  "au-

                                   called  a  packet  identifier  (PID).  Each
                                   transport stream program corresponds to one
                                   MediaConvert  output.  The  PMT  lists  the

                                   PID. Downstream systems and players use the
                                   program  map  table  to look up the PID for
                                   each type of data it accesses and then uses
                                   the PIDs to locate specific data within the
                                   asset.

                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration of the video stream. Af-
                                      ter  padding  or  trimming,  the   audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                                      diaConvert   applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)

                                      each PES packet.

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  packet  identifiers (PIDs)
                                      for any elementary audio streams you in-
                                      clude  in  this output. Specify multiple
                                      PIDs as a JSON  array.  Default  is  the
                                      range 482-492.

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify the output bitrate of the trans-
                                      port stream in bits per second.  Setting
                                      to 0 lets the muxer automatically deter-
                                      mine the appropriate bitrate. Other com-
                                      mon  values  are  3750000,  7500000, and

                                      accurate  interleaving. If set to MULTI-
                                      PLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set
                                      to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                                      but low-memory devices may not  be  able
                                      to  play  back the stream without inter-
                                      ruptions.

                                      and  data  packets  with lesser PTS val-
                                      ues). Keep the default value  (AUTO)  to
                                      allow all PTS values.

                                   MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                      When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary
                                      Points do not come within the  specified
                                      time  interval  of each other by looking
                                      ahead at input video. If another EBP  is
                                      going  to  come  in within the specified
                                      time interval, the current  EBP  is  not
                                      emitted,  and the segment is "stretched"
                                      to the next marker. The lookahead  value
                                      does  not add latency to the system. The
                                      Live Event must be configured  elsewhere
                                      to create sufficient latency to make the
                                      lookahead accurate.

                                   NielsenId3 -> (string)
                                      If INSERT, Nielsen inaudible  tones  for
                                      media  tracking  will be detected in the
                                      input audio and an  equivalent  ID3  tag
                                      will be inserted in the output.

                                   NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                                      Value  in  bits per second of extra null
                                      packets to  insert  into  the  transport
                                      stream. This can be used if a downstream
                                      encryption system requires periodic null
                                      packets.

                                   PatInterval -> (integer)
                                      The  number  of milliseconds between in-
                                      stances of  this  table  in  the  output
                                      transport stream.

                                   PcrControl -> (string)
                                      When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Pro-
                                      gram Clock Reference value  is  inserted
                                      for  every  Packetized Elementary Stream
                                      (PES) header.  This  is  effective  only
                                      when  the  PCR  PID  is  the same as the
                                      video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PcrPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for
                                      the  program  clock  reference  (PCR) in
                                      this output. If you  do  not  specify  a
                                      value,  the  service  will use the value
                                      for Video PID (VideoPid).

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)
                                      Specify the number of  milliseconds  be-
                                      tween instances of the program map table
                                      (PMT) in the output transport stream.

                                   PmtPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for
                                      the  program map table (PMT) itself. De-
                                      fault is 480.

                                   PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of
                                      the  private metadata stream. Default is
                                      503.

                                   ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use Program  number  (programNumber)  to
                                      specify  the  program number used in the
                                      program map table (PMT) for this output.
                                      Default  is  1. Program numbers and pro-
                                      gram map  tables  are  parts  of  MPEG-2
                                      transport  stream  containers,  used for
                                      organizing data.

                                   RateMode -> (string)
                                      When set to CBR,  inserts  null  packets
                                      into  transport stream to fill specified
                                      bitrate. When set to  VBR,  the  bitrate
                                      setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but
                                      the output will not be padded up to that
                                      bitrate.

                                   Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                                      Include this in your job settings to put
                                      SCTE-35 markers in your HLS  and  trans-

                                      points that you specify in an  ESAM  XML
                                      document.  Provide  the  document in the
                                      setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                                      Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)

                                   Scte35Source -> (string)
                                      For SCTE-35 markers  from  your  input--
                                      Choose  Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH) if you

                                   SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                                      Inserts  segmentation  markers  at  each
                                      segmentation_time  period.  rai_segstart
                                      sets  the Random Access Indicator bit in
                                      the adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the

                                   SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                      The segmentation  style  parameter  con-
                                      trols  how  segmentation markers are in-
                                      serted into the transport  stream.  With
                                      avails, it is possible that segments may
                                      be truncated, which can influence  where
                                      future   segmentation  markers  are  in-
                                      serted. When  a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "reset_cadence"  is  selected and a seg-
                                      ment is truncated due to  an  avail,  we
                                      will  reset  the  segmentation  cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      have a duration of of $segmentation_time
                                      seconds. When a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "maintain_cadence"  is  selected  and  a
                                      segment is truncated due to an avail, we
                                      will not reset the segmentation cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      likely  be  truncated  as well. However,
                                      all segments after that will have a  du-
                                      ration  of  $segmentation_time  seconds.
                                      Note that EBP lookahead is a slight  ex-
                                      ception to this rule.

                                   SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                      Specify  the length, in seconds, of each
                                      segment. Required unless markers is  set
                                      to _none_.

                                   TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the packet identifier (PID) for
                                      timed metadata in this  output.  Default
                                      is 502.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the ID for the transport stream
                                      itself in the program map table for this
                                      output. Transport stream IDs and program
                                      map tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                      stream  containers,  used for organizing
                                      data.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of
                                      the   elementary  video  stream  in  the
                                      transport stream.

                               M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to the MPEG-2  trans-
                                   port  stream  (MPEG2-TS)  container for the
                                   MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS outputs.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to  very  small duration differences be-
                                      tween video and audio. For  this  situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default

                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total duration of the video stream.  Af-
                                      ter   padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer than the video stream. Me-
                                      diaConvert  applies  audio  padding   or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                      est) box will be  included  per  14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                      When set to XDCAM,  writes  MPEG2  video
                                      streams  into  the  QuickTime file using
                                      XDCAM fourcc codes. This increases  com-
                                      patibility  with Apple editors and play-
                                      ers, but may decrease compatibility with
                                      other  players. Only applicable when the
                                      video codec is MPEG2.

                                   PaddingControl -> (string)
                                      To  make  this  output  compatible  with
                                      Omenon,  keep the default value, OMNEON.
                                      Unless you  need  Omneon  compatibility,
                                      set  this  value  to NONE. When you keep
                                      the default value, OMNEON,  MediaConvert
                                      increases  the  length  of the edit list
                                      atom. This might cause  file  rejections
                                      when  a  recipient  of  the  output file
                                      doesn't expct this extra padding.

                                   Reference -> (string)
                                      Always keep the default value (SELF_CON-
                                      TAINED) for this setting.

                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the  'ctts' (composition time to sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a

                                      est) box will be  included  per  14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless compliance to
                                      the  CTTS box version specification mat-
                                      ters in your workflow. Specify  a  value
                                      of  1  to set your CTTS box version to 1
                                      and make your output compliant with  the
                                      specification.  When you specify a value
                                      of 1, you must also set CSLG atom  (csl-
                                      gAtom)  to  the  value INCLUDE. Keep the
                                      default value 0 to  set  your  CTTS  box
                                      version  to 0. This can provide backward
                                      compatibility for some players and pack-
                                      agers.

                                   FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                                      Inserts a free-space box immediately af-

                                      captions.  This  markup  isn't generally
                                      required, but some video players require
                                      it  to  discover  and  play embedded 608
                                      captions. Keep the  default  value,  Ex-

                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to

                                          specify a larger number.

                            Extension -> (string)
                               Use Extension (Extension) to specify  the  file
                               extension for outputs in File output groups. If
                               you do not specify a value,  the  service  will

                            NameModifier -> (string)
                               Use Name modifier (NameModifier)  to  have  the
                               service  add a string to the end of each output
                               filename. You specify the base filename as part
                               of your destination URI. When you create multi-
                               ple outputs in the same output group, Name mod-
                               ifier (NameModifier) is required. Name modifier
                               also accepts format identifiers. For  DASH  ISO

                                   accepts the value DISABLED  for  AntiAlias.
                                   If  you  specify that in your job, the ser-
                                   vice will ignore the setting.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your

                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify the GOP length (keyframe in-
                                          terval)  in frames. With AV1, Media-
                                          Convert doesn't support  GOP  length
                                          in   seconds.  This  value  must  be
                                          greater  than  zero  and  preferably
                                          equal  to 1 + ((numberBFrames + 1) *
                                          x), where x is an integer value.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify from the number of B-frames,
                                          in the range of 0-15. For AV1 encod-
                                          ing, we recommend  using  7  or  15.
                                          Choose  a  larger number for a lower
                                          bitrate  and  smaller   file   size;
                                          choose  a  smaller number for better
                                          video quality.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                          Settings for  quality-defined  vari-
                                          able bitrate encoding with the H.265
                                          codec. Use these settings only  when
                                          you  set  QVBR for Rate control mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-
                                             trolMode) to  QVBR.  Specify  the
                                             target  quality  level  for  this
                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.
                                             Optionally, to  specify  a  value
                                             between  whole numbers, also pro-

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For ex-
                                             ample,  if  you  want  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  be  7.33, set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the

                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex

                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the

                                             Multi-pass   (MULTI_PASS),   your
                                             video  quality is better and your
                                             output bitrate is more  accurate.
                                             That  is,  the  actual bitrate of

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you

                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list  are  decimal approximations of

                                          Choose the method that you want  Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-

                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs with the same field po-
                                          larity as the source. For jobs  that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-

                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                          first  and   then   interlaces   the
                                          frames.  When  you  choose Optimized

                                          value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce
                                          I-frame  pop. I-frame pop appears as
                                          a visual flicker that can arise when
                                          the  encoder  saves  bits by copying
                                          some  macroblocks  many  times  from
                                          frame  to  frame, and then refreshes
                                          them at the I-frame. When you enable
                                          this  setting,  the  encoder updates

                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-

                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP  length  using a whole number of
                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this value as frames or seconds  de-
                                          pending  on the value you choose for
                                          GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).  If
                                          you  want  to  allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set
                                          GOP  mode  control  to  Auto in each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-

                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-
                                          ting GOP size (GopSize).

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-
                                      ger)
                                          Percentage of the buffer that should
                                          initially  be  filled  (HRD   buffer
                                          model).

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          larity as the source. For jobs  that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-
                                          ior depends on the input scan  type.
                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use  this setting only when you also
                                          enable   Scene   change    detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).   This  setting
                                          determines how the  encoder  manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts as part of the  I-frame  ca-
                                          dence  and  the I-frames that it in-
                                          serts for Scene change detection. We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When you explicitly specify a  value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines  whether   to   skip   a   ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frame  by  the value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          this output. We recommend  that  you
                                          use  automatic behavior to allow the
                                          transcoder to choose the best  value
                                          based on characteristics of your in-
                                          put video. In  the  console,  choose

                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-

                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          codec.  Use these settings only when
                                          you set QVBR for Rate  control  mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting only when Rate

                                             that you choose. That is, the to-
                                             tal size of the video element  is
                                             less  than  or equal to the value
                                             you set multiplied by the  number

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  (RateCon-

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the right number of bits  to  use
                                             for  each  part  of  the video to

                                             you  specify.  When  you keep the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks  a  quality  level for you,
                                             based on characteristics of  your
                                             input  video.  If  you  prefer to
                                             specify a quality level,  specify
                                             a  number  from 1 through 10. Use
                                             higher numbers for greater  qual-
                                             ity.  Level  10 results in nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level  for most broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes is between  6  and  9.

                                             that is  between  whole  numbers.
                                             For  example,  if  you  want your
                                             QVBR quality level  to  be  7.33,

                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-

                                          setting  specifies  the quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, for flat quan-
                                          tization. Choose the value 1  or  16
                                          to  use  the  default  JVT softening

                                          H.264  specification. Choose a value
                                          from 17 to 128 to use planar  inter-
                                          polation.  Increasing values from 17
                                          to 128 result in  increasing  reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value 128  results  in  the  softest
                                          video.

                                          tion to a value other than AUTO, the
                                          default  value  for H264SpatialAdap-

                                          ABLED).  Keep  this default value to
                                          adjust  quantization   within   each
                                          frame  based on spatial variation of
                                          content complexity. When you  enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex  textured blocks are encoded
                                          with fewer bits and smooth  textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses fewer bits on areas  of
                                          the  frame  that  aren't  moving and
                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.
                                          For example, this  feature  improves
                                          the  readability  of text tickers on
                                          newscasts and scoreboards on  sports
                                          matches.  Enabling this feature will
                                          almost  always  improve  your  video

                                          feature doesn't  take  into  account

                                          pop appears as a visual flicker that
                                          can arise  when  the  encoder  saves
                                          bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks
                                          many times from frame to frame,  and

                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP  length  using a whole number of
                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this value as frames or seconds  de-
                                          pending  on the value you choose for
                                          GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).  If
                                          you  want  to  allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set
                                          GOP  mode  control  to  Auto in each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-
                                          ified, frames (FRAMES) or Specified,
                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-
                                          ting GOP size (GopSize).

                                      HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (inte-

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          larity as the source. For jobs  that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-

                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on

                                          (SceneChangeDetect).   This  setting
                                          determines how the  encoder  manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts as part of the  I-frame  ca-
                                          dence  and  the I-frames that it in-
                                          serts for Scene change detection. We
                                          recommend    that   you   have   the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value  for you based on characteris-
                                          tics of your input video. To  enable
                                          this  automatic  behavior,  keep the
                                          default value by leaving  this  set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion. In the  console,  do  this  by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When you explicitly specify a  value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines  whether   to   skip   a   ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frame  by  the value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number of reference frames  to  use.
                                          The  encoder  may  use more than re-
                                          quested if using B-frames and/or in-

                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-

                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample,  the value for parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for output video  quality.  The  de-
                                          fault   behavior  is  faster,  lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          codec. Use these settings only  when
                                          you  set  QVBR for Rate control mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting only  when  Rate
                                             control  mode is QVBR and Quality
                                             tuning level  is  Multi-pass  HQ.

                                             that you choose. That is, the to-
                                             tal  size of the video element is

                                             you  set multiplied by the number
                                             of seconds of encoded output.

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-
                                             trolMode) to  QVBR.  Specify  the

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For ex-
                                             ample,  if  you  want  your  QVBR
                                             quality  level  to  be  7.33, set
                                             qvbrQualityLevel  to  7  and  set
                                             qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33.

                                          QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                             Optional. Specify a value here to
                                             set the QVBR quality to  a  level
                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,

                                          you enable  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert
                                          relabels  the video frames to 25 fps
                                          and resamples your audio to keep  it

                                          that  enabling  this  setting   will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video. Required settings:  You  must

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Enabled (EN-
                                          ABLED),   to   adjust   quantization
                                          within  each  frame based on spatial
                                          variation  of  content   complexity.
                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses  fewer  bits  on  areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with no noticeable  visual  degrada-
                                          tion  and  uses  more  bits on areas
                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer   bits   and  smooth  textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the
                                          viewer's  attention is likely to be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing
                                          their  attention  on  a  part of the

                                          and video games, set it to Low.  For

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses fewer bits on areas of
                                          the frame  that  aren't  moving  and
                                          uses  more  bits  on complex objects
                                          with sharp edges that  move  a  lot.
                                          For  example,  this feature improves
                                          the readability of text  tickers  on

                                          almost  always  improve  your  video
                                          quality.  Note,  though,  that  this

                                          outputs, when you choose HVC1,  your

                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify the  relative  frequency  of
                                          open  to closed GOPs in this output.
                                          For example, if you  want  to  allow
                                          four  open  GOPs  and then require a
                                          closed GOP, set  this  value  to  5.
                                          When  you create a streaming output,
                                          we recommend that you keep  the  de-
                                          fault  value,  1,  so  that  players
                                          starting mid-stream receive  an  IDR
                                          frame  as quickly as possible. Don't
                                          set this  value  to  0;  that  would
                                          break output segmenting.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify    the    interval   between
                                          keyframes, in seconds or frames, for

                                          is Frames (FRAMES).

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify the units for GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size). If you don't specify a  value
                                          here,  by  default  the encoder mea-
                                          sures GOP size in frames.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use
                                          Follow,    default     top     (FOL-

                                          larity as the source. For jobs  that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-

                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                          Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraD-
                                          cPrecision) to set quantization pre-
                                          cision for  intra-block  DC  coeffi-
                                          cients.  If  you  choose  the  value
                                          auto, the service will automatically
                                          select  the  precision  based on the
                                          per-frame compression ratio.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part of the I-frame ca-
                                          dence and the I-frames that  it  in-
                                          serts  for  Scene  change detection.
                                          When you specify a  value  for  this
                                          setting,   the   encoder  determines
                                          whether  to  skip  a  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame  by  the  value you set. For
                                          example, if you set Min  I  interval
                                          (minIInterval)   to   5  and  a  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frame   would   fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          are whole numbers from 0 through  7.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default

                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect

                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore this setting unless your  in-

                                          synchronized  with  the  video. Note
                                          that  enabling  this  setting   will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video. Required settings:  You  must
                                          also  set  Framerate  to 25. In your
                                          JSON job specification, set (framer-

                                      Softness -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this setting unless you need
                                          to comply with a specification  that
                                          requires  a  specific  value. If you
                                          don't have a specification  require-
                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness (sharpness) or  by  enabling  a
                                          noise  reducer filter (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).  The  Softness   (softness)
                                          setting  specifies  the quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, to use the AWS
                                          Elemental default matrices. Choose a
                                          value  from  17 to 128 to use planar
                                          interpolation.   Increasing   values
                                          from  17 to 128 result in increasing
                                          reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                                          The value 128 results in the softest
                                          video.

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Enabled (EN-
                                          ABLED),   to   adjust   quantization
                                          within each frame based  on  spatial
                                          variation   of  content  complexity.
                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses  fewer  bits  on areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the
                                          viewer's attention is likely to  be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing
                                          their attention on  a  part  of  the

                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses fewer bits on areas  of
                                          the  frame  that  aren't  moving and
                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.
                                          For example, this  feature  improves
                                          the  readability  of text tickers on

                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field  first  (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-
                                          LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default
                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs with the same field po-
                                          larity  as the source. For jobs that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course of the output. Follow  behav-
                                          ior  depends on the input scan type.
                                          If the  source  is  interlaced,  the
                                          output  will  be interlaced with the
                                          same polarity as the source. If  the
                                          source  is  progressive,  the output
                                          will be interlaced  with  top  field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample,  the value for parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half  of  your  input frame rate. In
                                          this situation, choose Optimized in-

                                          first   and   then   interlaces  the
                                          frames. When  you  choose  Optimized
                                          interlacing  and you set your output
                                          frame rate to  a  value  that  isn't
                                          suitable  for optimized interlacing,

                                          (SOFT).  You can't use optimized in-
                                          terlacing for hard telecine outputs.
                                          You  must  also  set  Interlace mode
                                          (interlaceMode)  to  a  value  other

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore  this setting unless your in-
                                          put  frame  rate  is  23.976  or  24
                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it
                                          synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                                          that   enabling  this  setting  will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your

                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from

                                          FramerateNumerator  and FramerateDe-

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose the method that you want  Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your

                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer
                                          model) in bits. For  example,  enter
                                          five megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.  Specify  the  maximum bi-
                                          trate in bits/second.  For  example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP8 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value VP9.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target  bitrate  in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow

                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your

                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.  Specify  the  maximum bi-
                                          trate in bits/second.  For  example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          for this output. The default  behav-
                                          ior  is to use the same pixel aspect
                                          ratio as your input video.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP9 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   XavcSettings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value XAVC.

                                      AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO),
                                          for this setting to  have  MediaCon-

                                          content. When you want to apply your
                                          quantization settings manually,  you
                                          must   set   Adaptive   quantization
                                          (adaptiveQuantization)  to  a  value
                                          other  than  Auto  (AUTO).  Use this
                                          setting to specify the  strength  of

                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Frame rate. In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for

                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          wise,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-

                                          H.264  specification. Choose a value
                                          from 17 to 128 to use planar  inter-
                                          polation.  Increasing values from 17
                                          to 128 result in  increasing  reduc-

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          The  best  way  to  set  up adaptive
                                          quantization is to keep the  default
                                          value,  Auto (AUTO), for the setting
                                          Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuan-
                                          tization). When you do so, MediaCon-
                                          vert automatically applies the  best

                                          content.  Include  this  setting  in
                                          your  JSON  job  specification  only
                                          when you choose to  change  the  de-

                                          tion. For this setting, keep the de-
                                          fault  value,  Enabled (ENABLED), to
                                          adjust  quantization   within   each
                                          frame  based on spatial variation of
                                          content complexity. When you  enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on

                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer

                                             often  to smooth out the flicker.

                                             source  is interlaced, the output
                                             will be interlaced with the  same
                                             polarity  as  the  source. If the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom field first, depending  on
                                             which  of  the Follow options you
                                             choose.

                               Crop -> (structure)
                                   Use Cropping selection  (crop)  to  specify
                                   the  video  area  that the service will in-
                                   clude in the output video frame.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Height of rectangle in  pixels.  Specify
                                      only even numbers.

                               DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                                   Applies only to  29.97  fps  outputs.  When
                                   this  feature  is enabled, the service will
                                   use drop-frame timecode on outputs.  If  it
                                   is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                                   the    system    will    fall    back    to
                                   non-drop-frame.  This setting is enabled by
                                   default  when  Timecode  insertion   (Time-

                                   put.  Specify  in pixels. If you don't pro-
                                   vide a value here, the service will use the
                                   input height.

                               Position -> (structure)
                                   Use  Selection  placement (position) to de-
                                   fine the video area in your  output  frame.
                                   The  area outside of the rectangle that you
                                   specify here is black.

                                   this when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE).  A
                                   preferred  implementation  of this workflow
                                   is to set RespondToAfd to  (NONE)  and  set
                                   AfdSignaling  to  (AUTO).  * Choose None to
                                   remove all input AFD values from this  out-

                               ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                                   Specify  how  the  service  handles outputs
                                   that have a different aspect ratio from the
                                   input  aspect ratio. Choose Stretch to out-
                                   put (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have the service
                                   stretch  your  video image to fit. Keep the
                                   setting Default (DEFAULT) to have the  ser-
                                   vice  letterbox  your  video  instead. This
                                   setting overrides any value that you  spec-

                                   Use Sharpness (Sharpness) setting to  spec-
                                   ify  the  strength  of  anti-aliasing. This
                                   setting changes the width of the anti-alias
                                   filter  kernel  used for scaling. Sharpness
                                   only applies if your output  resolution  is
                                   different  from your input resolution. 0 is
                                   the softest setting, 100 the sharpest,  and
                                   50 recommended for most content.

                               TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                                   Applies  only  to  H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and
                                   ProRes outputs. Only enable Timecode inser-
                                   tion when the input frame rate is identical
                                   to the output frame rate. To include  time-
                                   codes  in  this output, set Timecode inser-
                                   tion (VideoTimecodeInsertion)  to  PIC_TIM-
                                   ING_SEI.  To leave them out, set it to DIS-
                                   ABLED. Default is DISABLED. When  the  ser-
                                   vice inserts timecodes in an output, by de-
                                   fault, it uses any embedded timecodes  from
                                   the input. If none are present, the service
                                   will set the timecode for the first  output
                                   frame  to  zero. To change this default be-
                                   havior, adjust the settings under  Timecode
                                   configuration (TimecodeConfig). In the con-

                                          MediaConvert also changes the output

                                          Use Font Size (FontSize) to set  the
                                          font size of any burned-in timecode.
                                          Valid values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                          Use  Prefix  (Prefix) to place ASCII
                                          characters  before   any   burned-in
                                          timecode.  For  example, a prefix of
                                          "EZ-" will result  in  the  timecode
                                          "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the

                                          code   equivalents.   The  supported
                                          range of characters is 0x20  through
                                          0x7e.  This  includes  letters, num-

                                          represented  on  a  standard English

                                   Use Width (Width) to define the video reso-
                                   lution  width,  in pixels, for this output.
                                   If you don't provide a value here, the ser-
                                   vice will use the input width.

              TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                 These  settings  control  how  the  service handles timecodes
                 throughout the job. These settings don't affect  input  clip-
                 ping.

                 Anchor -> (string)
                     If  you  use an editing platform that relies on an anchor
                     timecode, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a time-
                     code  that will match the input video frame to the output
                     video  frame.  Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores
                     frame rate conversion. System behavior for  Anchor  Time-
                     code  varies  depending on your setting for Source (Time-
                     codeSource). * If Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Spec-
                     ified  Start  (SPECIFIEDSTART),  the first input frame is
                     the specified value in  Start  Timecode  (Start).  Anchor
                     Timecode  (Anchor)  and  Start  Timecode (Start) are used
                     calculate output timecode. * If  Source  (TimecodeSource)
                     is  set  to  Start  at  0  (ZEROBASED) the first frame is
                     00:00:00:00. * If Source (TimecodeSource) is set  to  Em-
                     bedded  (EMBEDDED), the first frame is the timecode value
                     on the first input frame of the input.

                 Source -> (string)
                     Use Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are han-
                     dled  within  this job. To make sure that your video, au-
                     dio, captions, and  markers  are  synchronized  and  that
                     time-based  features,  such  as image inserter, work cor-
                     rectly, choose the Timecode source  option  that  matches
                     your  assets.  All timecodes are in a 24-hour format with
                     frame number (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED)  -  Use
                     the  timecode  that is in the input video. If no embedded
                     timecode is in the source, the service will use Start  at
                     0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the
                     timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified
                     Start  (SPECIFIEDSTART) - Set the timecode of the initial
                     frame to a value other than zero. You use Start  timecode
                     (Start) to provide this value.

                     fied start (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start  timecode  (Start)
                     to  specify  the  timecode  for  the  initial  frame. Use
                     24-hour  format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)   or
                     (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                 TimestampOffset -> (string)
                     Only  applies  to  outputs that support program-date-time
                     stamp. Use Timestamp offset  (TimestampOffset)  to  over-
                     write  the  timecode  date without affecting the time and
                     frame number. Provide the new date as  a  string  in  the
                     format  "yyyy-mm-dd".  To use Time stamp offset, you must
                     also enable Insert program-date-time  (InsertProgramDate-
                     Time)  in  the  output settings. For example, if the date
                     part of your timecodes  is  2002-1-25  and  you  want  to
                     change it to one year later, set Timestamp offset (Times-
                     tampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

              TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                 Enable Timed metadata insertion  (TimedMetadataInsertion)  to
                 include  ID3  tags in any HLS outputs. To include timed meta-
                 data, you must enable it here, enable it in each output  con-
                 tainer,  and  specify  tags  and  timecodes  in ID3 insertion
                 (Id3Insertion) objects.

                 Id3Insertions -> (list)
                     Id3Insertions contains  the  array  of  Id3Insertion  in-
                     stances.

                     (structure)
                        To insert ID3 tags in your output, specify two values.
                        Use ID3 tag (Id3)  to  specify  the  base  64  encoded
                        string and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time
                        when the tag should be inserted.  To  insert  multiple
                        ID3  tags in your output, create multiple instances of
                        ID3 insertion (Id3Insertion).

                        Id3 -> (string)
                            Use ID3 tag  (Id3)  to  provide  a  tag  value  in
                            base64-encode format.

                        Timecode -> (string)
                            Provide  a  Timecode  (TimeCode) in HH:MM:SS:FF or
                            HH:MM:SS;FF format.

          StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
              Specify how often MediaConvert  sends  STATUS_UPDATE  events  to
              Amazon  CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds, between
              status updates. MediaConvert sends an update  at  this  interval
              from the time the service begins processing your job to the time
              it completes the transcode or encounters an error.

          Type -> (string)
              A job template can be of two types: system or custom. System  or
              built-in job templates can't be modified or deleted by the user.
