NAME
       get-preset -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve the JSON for a specific preset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

SYNOPSIS
            get-preset
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string) The name of the preset.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details for a particular preset

       The  following  get-preset  example requests the JSON definition of the
       specified custom preset.

OUTPUT
       Preset -> (structure)
          A  preset is a collection of preconfigured media conversion settings
          that you want MediaConvert to apply to the output during the conver-
          sion process.

          Arn -> (string)
              An  identifier  for  this  resource that is unique within all of
              AWS.

          Category -> (string)
              An optional category you create to organize your presets.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds for preset creation.

          Description -> (string)
              An optional description you create for each preset.

          LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp in epoch seconds when the preset was last updated.

          Name -> (string)
              A name you create for each preset.  Each  name  must  be  unique
              within your account.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Settings for preset

              AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                 (AudioDescriptions)  contains  groups  of audio encoding set-
                 tings organized by audio codec. Include one instance of  (Au-
                 dioDescriptions)  per output. (AudioDescriptions) can contain
                 multiple groups of encoding settings.

                 (structure)
                     Settings related to one audio  tab  on  the  MediaConvert
                     console.  In  your job JSON, an instance of AudioDescrip-
                     tion is equivalent to one audio tab in the console.  Usu-
                     ally,  one  audio  tab  corresponds  to  one output audio
                     track. Depending on how you set up your input  audio  se-
                     lectors  and  whether  you use audio selector groups, one
                     audio tab can correspond  to  a  group  of  output  audio
                     tracks.

                     AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                        When  you mimic a multi-channel audio layout with mul-
                        tiple mono-channel tracks, you can  tag  each  channel
                        layout manually. For example, you would tag the tracks
                        that contain your left, right, and center  audio  with
                        Left  (L),  Right  (R),  and Center (C), respectively.
                        When you don't specify a  value,  MediaConvert  labels
                        your track as Center (C) by default. To use audio lay-
                        out tagging, your output must be in a QuickTime (.mov)
                        container; your audio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF;
                        and you must set up your audio track to have only  one
                        channel.

                        ChannelTag -> (string)
                            You  can  add  a  tag  for this mono-channel audio
                            track to mimic its placement  in  a  multi-channel
                            layout.  For  example,  if  this track is the left
                            surround channel, choose Left surround (LS).

                     AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                        Advanced audio normalization  settings.  Ignore  these
                        settings  unless  you  need  to comply with a loudness
                        standard.

                        Algorithm -> (string)
                            Choose one of the  following  audio  normalization
                            algorithms:  ITU-R  BS.1770-1: Ungated loudness. A
                            measurement of ungated average loudness for an en-
                            tire piece of content, suitable for measurement of
                            short-form content under ATSC recommendation A/85.
                            Supports   up   to   5.1   audio  channels.  ITU-R
                            BS.1770-2: Gated loudness. A measurement of  gated
                            average  loudness  compliant with the requirements
                            of EBU-R128. Supports up to  5.1  audio  channels.
                            ITU-R  BS.1770-3: Modified peak. The same loudness
                            measurement algorithm as 1770-2, with  an  updated
                            true  peak  measurement.  ITU-R  BS.1770-4: Higher
                            channel count. Allows for more audio channels than
                            the  other  algorithms,  including  configurations
                            such as 7.1.

                        AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                            When enabled the output audio is  corrected  using
                            the  chosen algorithm. If disabled, the audio will
                            be measured but not adjusted.

                        CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                            Content measuring above this level  will  be  cor-
                            rected  to the target level. Content measuring be-
                            low this level will not be corrected.

                        LoudnessLogging -> (string)
                            If set to LOG, log each output's audio track loud-
                            ness to a CSV file.

                        PeakCalculation -> (string)
                            If  set  to TRUE_PEAK, calculate and log the True-
                            Peak for each output's audio track loudness.

                        TargetLkfs -> (double)
                            When you use Audio normalization  (AudioNormaliza-
                            tionSettings),  optionally  use  this  setting  to
                            specify a target loudness. If you don't specify  a
                            value  here,  the encoder chooses a value for you,
                            based on the algorithm that you choose  for  Algo-
                            rithm (algorithm). If you choose algorithm 1770-1,
                            the encoder will choose -24 LKFS;  otherwise,  the
                            encoder will choose -23 LKFS.

                        TruePeakLimiterThreshold -> (double)
                            Specify  the  True-peak limiter threshold in deci-
                            bels relative to full scale (dBFS). The  peak  in-
                            ter-audio  sample  loudness in your output will be
                            limited to the value that you specify, without af-
                            fecting  the  overall  target  LKFS. Enter a value
                            from 0 to -8. Leave blank to use the default value
                            0.

                     AudioSourceName -> (string)
                        Specifies  which audio data to use from each input. In
                        the simplest case, specify  an  "Audio  Selector":#in-
                        puts-audio_selector  by name based on its order within
                        each input. For example if you specify "Audio Selector
                        3",  then  the  third audio selector will be used from
                        each input. If an input does not have an "Audio Selec-
                        tor 3", then the audio selector marked as "default" in
                        that input will be used. If there is no audio selector
                        marked  as "default", silence will be inserted for the
                        duration of that input. Alternatively, an  "Audio  Se-
                        lector Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group name may be
                        specified, with similar default/silence  behavior.  If
                        no  audio_source_name is specified, then "Audio Selec-
                        tor 1" will be chosen automatically.

                     AudioType -> (integer)
                        Applies only if Follow Input Audio Type  is  unchecked
                        (false). A number between 0 and 255. The following are
                        defined in ISO-IEC 13818-1: 0 = Undefined, 1  =  Clean
                        Effects,  2  = Hearing Impaired, 3 = Visually Impaired
                        Commentary, 4-255 = Reserved.

                     AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                        When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input contains an ISO
                        639  audio_type,  then that value is passed through to
                        the output. If the  input  contains  no  ISO  639  au-
                        dio_type,  the  value in Audio Type is included in the
                        output. Otherwise the value in Audio Type is  included
                        in  the output. Note that this field and audioType are
                        both ignored if audioDescriptionBroadcasterMix is  set
                        to BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD.

                     CodecSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  related  to  audio encoding. The settings in
                        this group vary depending on the value that you choose
                        for your audio codec.

                        AacSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (AudioDescrip-
                            tions)>(CodecSettings) to the value AAC. The  ser-
                            vice  accepts one of two mutually exclusive groups
                            of AAC settings--VBR and CBR.  To  select  one  of
                            these modes, set the value of Bitrate control mode
                            (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR". In VBR  mode,
                            you control the audio quality with the setting VBR
                            quality (vbrQuality). In CBR  mode,  you  use  the
                            setting Bitrate (bitrate). Defaults and valid val-
                            ues depend on the rate control mode.

                            AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)
                               Choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input con-
                               tains  pre-mixed main audio + audio description
                               (AD) as a stereo pair. The value for  AudioType
                               will  be  set to 3, which signals to downstream
                               systems that this stream contains  "broadcaster
                               mixed  AD". Note that the input received by the
                               encoder must contain pre-mixed audio;  the  en-
                               coder  does  not  perform  the mixing. When you
                               choose BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD,  the  encoder  ig-
                               nores  any  values you provide in AudioType and
                               FollowInputAudioType. Choose  NORMAL  when  the
                               input  does not contain pre-mixed audio + audio
                               description (AD). In  this  case,  the  encoder
                               will  use  any values you provide for AudioType
                               and FollowInputAudioType.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               The  set  of  valid values for this setting is:
                               6000, 8000, 10000, 12000, 14000, 16000,  20000,
                               24000,   28000,  32000,  40000,  48000,  56000,
                               64000, 80000, 96000,  112000,  128000,  160000,
                               192000, 224000, 256000, 288000, 320000, 384000,
                               448000, 512000, 576000, 640000, 768000, 896000,
                               1024000.  The value you set is also constrained
                               by the  values  that  you  choose  for  Profile
                               (codecProfile),  Bitrate  control mode (coding-
                               Mode), and Sample  rate  (sampleRate).  Default
                               values  depend on Bitrate control mode and Pro-
                               file.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)

                            CodingMode -> (string)
                               The Coding mode that you specify determines the
                               number  of audio channels and the audio channel
                               layout metadata in your AAC output. Valid  cod-
                               ing  modes  depend on the Rate control mode and
                               Profile that you  select.  The  following  list
                               shows  the number of audio channels and channel
                               layout for each coding mode. *  1.0  Audio  De-

                               Rate Control Mode.

                            RawFormat -> (string)
                               Enables LATM/LOAS AAC output. Note that if  you
                               use LATM/LOAS AAC in an output, you must choose
                               "No container" for the output container.

                            SampleRate -> (integer)
                               Specify the Sample rate  in  Hz.  Valid  sample
                               rates  depend  on  the  Profile and Coding mode
                               that you select. The following list shows valid
                               sample  rates for each Profile and Coding mode.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               The bitrate that you specify must be a multiple
                               of  8000 within the allowed minimum and maximum
                               values. Leave blank to use the default  bitrate

                            DynamicRangeCompressionProfile -> (string)
                               When you want to add Dolby dynamic  range  com-
                               pression (DRC) signaling to your output stream,
                               we recommend that  you  use  the  mode-specific
                               settings  instead  of Dynamic range compression
                               profile  (DynamicRangeCompressionProfile).  The
                               mode-specific  settings  are Dynamic range com-
                               pression profile, line  mode  (dynamicRangeCom-
                               pressionLine)  and  Dynamic  range  compression
                               profile, RF  mode  (dynamicRangeCompressionRf).
                               Note that when you specify values for all three
                               settings, MediaConvert  ignores  the  value  of
                               this setting in favor of the mode-specific set-

                               be sourced from the DD, DD+, or DolbyE  decoder
                               that supplied this audio data. If audio was not
                               supplied from one of these  streams,  then  the
                               static metadata settings will be used.

                               the transcode. Inputs  that  alternate  between
                               DD+  and non-DD+ content will have a consistent
                               DD+ output as  the  system  alternates  between
                               passthrough and encoding.

                     CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                        Specify the language for this audio output track.  The
                        service puts this language code into your output audio
                        track when you set Language  code  control  (AudioLan-
                        guageCodeControl)  to Use configured (USE_CONFIGURED).
                        The service also uses your specified  custom  language
                        code  when  you  set  Language code control (AudioLan-
                        guageCodeControl) to Follow input (FOLLOW_INPUT),  but
                        your  input  file doesn't specify a language code. For
                        all outputs, you can use an ISO  639-2  or  ISO  639-3
                        code.  For  streaming  outputs,  you  can also use any
                        other code in the full RFC-5646 specification. Stream-
                        ing outputs are those that are in one of the following
                        output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO, Apple HLS, or Microsoft
                        Smooth Streaming.

                     LanguageCode -> (string)
                        Indicates  the language of the audio output track. The
                        ISO 639 language specified in the 'Language Code' drop
                        down will be used when 'Follow Input Language Code' is
                        not selected or when 'Follow Input Language  Code'  is
                        selected  but there is no ISO 639 language code speci-
                        fied by the input.

                     LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                        Specify which source for language  code  takes  prece-
                        dence for this audio track. When you choose Follow in-
                        put (FOLLOW_INPUT), the service uses the language code
                        from  the  input  track if it's present. If there's no
                        languge code on the input track, the service uses  the
                        code  that  you  specify  in the setting Language code
                        (languageCode or customLanguageCode). When you  choose
                        Use  configured (USE_CONFIGURED), the service uses the
                        language code that you specify.

                        Advanced audio remixing settings.

                        ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                            Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping)  contains   the
                            group  of  fields that hold the remixing value for
                            each channel, in dB. Specify remix values to indi-
                            cate how much of the content from your input audio
                            channel you want in your  output  audio  channels.
                            Each  instance  of the InputChannels or InputChan-
                            nelsFineTune array specifies these values for  one
                            output channel. Use one instance of this array for
                            each output channel. In the  console,  each  array
                            corresponds to a column in the graphical depiction
                            of the mapping matrix. The rows of  the  graphical
                            matrix  correspond to input channels. Valid values
                            are within the range from -60 (mute) through 6.  A
                            setting of 0 passes the input channel unchanged to
                            the output channel (no attenuation  or  amplifica-
                            tion).  Use InputChannels or InputChannelsFineTune
                            to specify your remix values. Don't use both.

                            OutputChannels -> (list)
                               In your JSON  job  specification,  include  one
                               child  of OutputChannels for each audio channel
                               that you want in your output. Each child should
                               contain  one  instance  of InputChannels or In-
                               putChannelsFineTune.

                                      (double)

                        ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of audio channels from your in-
                            put  that  you  want  to  use in your output. With
                            remixing, you might combine or split the  data  in
                            these  channels, so the number of channels in your
                            final output might be different. If you are  doing
                            both input channel mapping and output channel map-
                            ping, the number of output channels in your  input
                            mapping  must  be  the same as the number of input
                            channels in your output mapping.

                        ChannelsOut -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of channels in this output  af-
                            ter  remixing.  Valid values: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8... 64.
                            (1 and even numbers to 64.) If you are doing  both
                            input  channel mapping and output channel mapping,
                            the number of output channels in your  input  map-
                            ping must be the same as the number of input chan-
                            nels in your output mapping.

                     StreamName -> (string)
                        Specify a label for this output audio stream. For  ex-
                        ample, "English", "Director commentary", or "track_2".
                        For streaming outputs, MediaConvert passes this infor-
                        mation  into  destination manifests for display on the
                        end-viewer's player device. For outputs in other  out-
                        put groups, the service ignores this setting.

              CaptionDescriptions -> (list)
                 This  object holds groups of settings related to captions for
                 one output. For each output that has  captions,  include  one
                 instance of CaptionDescriptions.

                     CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                        Specify  the  language for this captions output track.
                        For most captions output  formats,  the  encoder  puts
                        this language information in the output captions meta-
                        data. If your output captions  format  is  DVB-Sub  or
                        Burn  in,  the  encoder uses this language information
                        when automatically selecting the font script for  ren-
                        dering the captions text. For all outputs, you can use
                        an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code. For streaming outputs,
                        you  can  also use any other code in the full RFC-5646
                        specification. Streaming outputs are those that are in
                        one  of  the  following output groups: CMAF, DASH ISO,
                        Apple HLS, or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                     DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings related to one captions tab on the  MediaCon-
                        vert  console.  In  your job JSON, an instance of cap-
                        tions DestinationSettings is equivalent  to  one  cap-
                        tions  tab  in  the console. Usually, one captions tab
                        corresponds to one output captions track. Depending on
                        your  output captions format, one tab might correspond
                        to a set of output captions tracks. For more  informa-

                        BurninDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Burn-in is a captions delivery method, rather than
                            a captions format. Burn-in writes the captions di-
                            rectly  on  your video frames, replacing pixels of
                            video content with the captions.  Set  up  burn-in
                            captions  in  the  same  output as your video. For
                            more               information,                see

                            tion,  include  this object and any required chil-
                            dren when you set destinationType to BURN_IN.

                            Alignment -> (string)
                               Specify the alignment of your captions.  If  no
                               explicit x_position is provided, setting align-
                               ment to centered will placethe captions at  the
                               bottom center of the output. Similarly, setting
                               a left alignment willalign captions to the bot-
                               tom  left  of  the output. If x and y positions
                               are given in conjunction with the alignment pa-
                               rameter,  the  font  will  be justified (either
                               left or centered)  relative  to  those  coordi-
                               nates.

                            ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless Style passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) is set to Enabled  and  Font
                               color  (FontColor)  set  to Black, Yellow, Red,
                               Green, Blue, or Hex. Use Apply font color  (Ap-
                               plyFontColor)  for  additional  font color con-
                               trols.  When  you  choose   White   text   only
                               (WHITE_TEXT_ONLY),  or  leave  blank, your font
                               color setting only applies  to  white  text  in
                               your  input captions. For example, if your font
                               color setting is Yellow, and  your  input  cap-
                               tions have red and white text, your output cap-
                               tions will have red and yellow text.  When  you
                               choose  ALL_TEXT,  your  font color setting ap-
                               plies to all of your output captions text.

                            BackgroundColor -> (string)
                               Specify the color of the rectangle  behind  the
                               captions.  Leave  background color (Background-
                               Color)  blank   and   set   Style   passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough)  to enabled to use the back-
                               ground color data from your input captions,  if
                               present.

                            BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity of the background rectan-
                               gle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where  0  is
                               transparent   and   255  is  opaque.  If  Style
                               passthrough (StylePassthrough) is  set  to  en-
                               abled,  leave  blank  to pass through the back-
                               ground style information in your input captions
                               to  your  output captions. If Style passthrough
                               is set to disabled, leave blank to use a  value
                               of  0 and remove all backgrounds from your out-
                               put captions.

                            FallbackFont -> (string)
                               Specify the font that you want the  service  to
                               use  for  your burn in captions when your input
                               captions  specify  a  font  that   MediaConvert
                               doesn't  support.  When  you  set Fallback font
                               (FallbackFont) to best match  (BEST_MATCH),  or
                               leave blank, MediaConvert uses a supported font
                               that most closely matches the  font  that  your
                               input captions specify. When there are multiple
                               unsupported fonts in your input captions, Medi-
                               aConvert  matches  each font with the supported
                               font that matches  best.  When  you  explicitly
                               choose  a  replacement  font, MediaConvert uses
                               that font to replace all unsupported fonts from
                               your input.

                            FontColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color  of  the burned-in captions
                               text. Leave Font color  (FontColor)  blank  and
                               set Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) to en-
                               abled to use the font color data from your  in-
                               put captions, if present.

                            FontOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the opacity of the burned-in captions.
                               255 is opaque; 0 is transparent.

                            FontResolution -> (integer)
                               Specify the Font resolution (FontResolution) in
                               DPI (dots per inch).

                            FontScript -> (string)
                               Set  Font  script (FontScript) to Automatically
                               determined (AUTOMATIC), or leave blank, to  au-
                               tomatically  determine  the font script in your
                               input captions. Otherwise,  set  to  Simplified
                               Chinese (HANS) or Traditional Chinese (HANT) if
                               your input font script uses Simplified or  Tra-
                               ditional Chinese.

                            FontSize -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  Font  size  (FontSize) in pixels.
                               Must be a positive integer. Set to 0, or  leave
                               blank, for automatic font size.

                            HexFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting unless your Font color is
                               set to Hex. Enter either six or eight hexideci-
                               mal  digits, representing red, green, and blue,
                               with two optional extra digits for  alpha.  For
                               example  a  value of 1122AABB is a red value of
                               0x11, a green value of 0x22, a  blue  value  of
                               0xAA, and an alpha value of 0xBB.

                            OutlineColor -> (string)
                               Specify font outline color. Leave Outline color
                               (OutlineColor) blank and set Style  passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough)  to  enabled to use the font
                               outline color data from your input captions, if
                               present.

                            OutlineSize -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  Outline size (OutlineSize) of the
                               caption text, in  pixels.  Leave  Outline  size
                               blank     and     set     Style     passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) to enabled to use  the  out-
                               line  size  data  from  your input captions, if
                               present.

                            ShadowColor -> (string)
                               Specify the color of the  shadow  cast  by  the
                               captions.   Leave  Shadow  color  (ShadowColor)
                               blank     and     set     Style     passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) to enabled to use the shadow
                               color  data  from  your  input   captions,   if
                               present.

                            ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity  of  the  shadow. Enter a
                               value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent and
                               255    is    opaque.   If   Style   passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) is  set  to  Enabled,  leave
                               Shadow  opacity  (ShadowOpacity)  blank to pass
                               through the shadow style  information  in  your
                               input  captions  to  your  output  captions. If
                               Style passthrough is  set  to  disabled,  leave
                               blank  to use a value of 0 and remove all shad-
                               ows from your output captions.

                            ShadowXOffset -> (integer)
                               Specify the horizontal offset  of  the  shadow,
                               relative  to the captions in pixels. A value of
                               -2 would result in a shadow offset 2 pixels  to

                            ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                               Specify the vertical offset of the shadow rela-
                               tive to the captions in pixels. A value  of  -2
                               would  result in a shadow offset 2 pixels above
                               the text. Leave Shadow y-offset (ShadowYOffset)
                               blank     and     set     Style     passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) to enabled to use the shadow
                               y-offset  data  from  your  input  captions, if
                               present.

                            StylePassthrough -> (string)
                               Set Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) to EN-
                               ABLED  to  use  the available style, color, and
                               position information from your input  captions.
                               MediaConvert  uses  default  settings  for  any
                               missing style and position information in  your
                               input  captions.  Set Style passthrough to DIS-
                               ABLED, or leave blank, to ignore the style  and
                               position  information  from your input captions
                               and use default settings: white text with black
                               outlining, bottom-center positioning, and auto-
                               matic sizing. Whether you set Style passthrough
                               to enabled or not, you can also choose to manu-
                               ally override any of the individual  style  and
                               position settings.

                            TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                               Specify whether the text spacing (TeletextSpac-
                               ing) in your captions is set  by  the  captions
                               grid,  or  varies  depending  on  letter width.
                               Choose fixed grid (FIXED_GRID)  to  conform  to
                               the spacing specified in the captions file more
                               accurately. Choose proportional  (PROPORTIONAL)
                               to make the text easier to read for closed cap-
                               tions.

                            XPosition -> (integer)
                               Specify the horizontal position (XPosition)  of
                               the  captions, relative to the left side of the
                               output in pixels. A value of 10 would result in
                               the  captions  starting 10 pixels from the left
                               of the output. If  no  explicit  x_position  is
                               provided,  the horizontal caption position will
                               be determined by the alignment parameter.

                            YPosition -> (integer)
                               Specify the vertical  position  (YPosition)  of
                               the captions, relative to the top of the output
                               in pixels. A value of 10 would  result  in  the
                               captions starting 10 pixels from the top of the
                               output. If no explicit y_position is  provided,
                               the caption will be positioned towards the bot-
                               tom of the output.

                        DestinationType -> (string)
                            Specify the format for this  set  of  captions  on
                            this  output. The default format is embedded with-
                            out SCTE-20. Note that your choice of video output
                            container  constrains  your  choice of output cap-
                            tions   format.   For   more   information,    see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html.
                            If you are using SCTE-20 and you want to create an
                            output that complies with the SCTE-43 spec, choose
                            SCTE-20 plus embedded  (SCTE20_PLUS_EMBEDDED).  To
                            create  a  non-compliant output where the embedded
                            captions come first, choose Embedded plus  SCTE-20
                            (EMBEDDED_PLUS_SCTE20).

                        DvbSubDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to  DVB-Sub  captions.  Set  up
                            DVB-Sub captions in the same output as your video.

                            When you work directly in your JSON job specifica-
                            tion, include this object and any  required  chil-
                            dren when you set destinationType to DVB_SUB.

                            Alignment -> (string)
                               Specify  the  alignment of your captions. If no
                               explicit x_position is provided, setting align-
                               ment  to centered will placethe captions at the
                               bottom center of the output. Similarly, setting
                               a left alignment willalign captions to the bot-
                               tom left of the output. If x  and  y  positions
                               are given in conjunction with the alignment pa-
                               rameter, the font  will  be  justified  (either
                               left  or  centered)  relative  to those coordi-
                               nates. Within your job settings,  all  of  your
                               DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                            ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless Style Passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough) is set to Enabled  and  Font
                               color  (FontColor)  set  to Black, Yellow, Red,
                               Green, Blue, or Hex. Use Apply font color  (Ap-
                               plyFontColor)  for  additional  font color con-
                               trols.  When  you  choose   White   text   only
                               (WHITE_TEXT_ONLY),  or  leave  blank, your font
                               color setting only applies  to  white  text  in
                               your  input captions. For example, if your font
                               color setting is Yellow, and  your  input  cap-
                               tions have red and white text, your output cap-
                               tions will have red and yellow text.  When  you
                               choose  ALL_TEXT,  your  font color setting ap-
                               plies to all of your output captions text.

                            BackgroundColor -> (string)
                               Specify the color of the rectangle  behind  the
                               captions.  Leave  background color (Background-
                               Color)  blank   and   set   Style   passthrough
                               (StylePassthrough)  to enabled to use the back-
                               ground color data from your input captions,  if
                               present.

                            BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  opacity of the background rectan-
                               gle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where  0  is
                               transparent   and   255  is  opaque.  If  Style
                               passthrough (StylePassthrough) is  set  to  en-
                               abled,  leave  blank  to pass through the back-
                               ground style information in your input captions
                               to  your  output captions. If Style passthrough
                               is set to disabled, leave blank to use a  value
                               of  0 and remove all backgrounds from your out-
                               put captions. Within your job settings, all  of
                               your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                            DdsHandling -> (string)
                               Specify  how  MediaConvert  handles the display
                               definition segment (DDS). To  exclude  the  DDS
                               from  this  set  of captions: Keep the default,
                               None. To include  the  DDS:  Choose  Specified.
                               When  you  do,  also specify the offset coordi-
                               nates of the display window with DDS  x-coordi-
                               nate  and DDS y-coordinate. To include the DDS,
                               but not include display window data: Choose  No
                               display  window. When you do, you can write po-
                               sition metadata to the page composition segment
                               (PCS)  with  DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordi-
                               nate. For video resolutions with  a  height  of
                               576  pixels  or  less, MediaConvert doesn't in-
                               clude the DDS,  regardless  of  the  value  you
                               choose   for  DDS  handling.  All  burn-in  and
                               DVB-Sub font settings must match.

                            DdsXCoordinate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting, along with  DDS  y-coordinate
                               (ddsYCoordinate),  to  specify  the  upper left
                               corner of the display definition segment  (DDS)
                               display  window. With this setting, specify the
                               distance, in pixels, between the left  side  of
                               the  frame and the left side of the DDS display
                               window. Keep the default value, 0, to have  Me-
                               diaConvert  automatically  choose  this offset.
                               Related setting: When you use this setting, you
                               must  set DDS handling (ddsHandling) to a value
                               other than None (NONE). MediaConvert uses these
                               values to determine whether to write page posi-
                               tion data to the DDS or to the page composition
                               segment  (PCS).  All  burn-in  and DVB-Sub font
                               settings must match.

                            DdsYCoordinate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting, along with  DDS  x-coordinate
                               (ddsXCoordinate),  to  specify  the  upper left
                               corner of the display definition segment  (DDS)
                               display  window. With this setting, specify the

                               frame  and  the  top of the DDS display window.
                               Keep the default value, 0, to have MediaConvert
                               automatically  choose this offset. Related set-
                               ting: When you use this setting, you  must  set
                               DDS  handling  (ddsHandling)  to  a value other
                               than None (NONE). MediaConvert uses these  val-
                               ues to determine whether to write page position
                               data to the DDS or to the page composition seg-
                               ment  (PCS).  All burn-in and DVB-Sub font set-
                               tings must match.

                            FallbackFont -> (string)
                               Specify the font that you want the  service  to
                               use  for  your burn in captions when your input
                               captions  specify  a  font  that   MediaConvert
                               doesn't  support.  When  you  set Fallback font
                               (FallbackFont) to best match  (BEST_MATCH),  or
                               leave blank, MediaConvert uses a supported font
                               that most closely matches the  font  that  your
                               input captions specify. When there are multiple
                               unsupported fonts in your input captions, Medi-
                               aConvert  matches  each font with the supported
                               font that matches  best.  When  you  explicitly
                               choose  a  replacement  font, MediaConvert uses
                               that font to replace all unsupported fonts from
                               your input.

                            FontColor -> (string)
                               Specify  the  color of the captions text. Leave
                               Font color  (FontColor)  blank  and  set  Style
                               passthrough  (StylePassthrough)  to  enabled to

                               tions,  if  present.  Within your job settings,
                               all of your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               input captions. Set Style passthrough  to  DIS-
                               ABLED,  or leave blank, to ignore the style and
                               position information from your  input  captions
                               and use default settings: white text with black
                               outlining, bottom-center positioning, and auto-
                               matic sizing. Whether you set Style passthrough
                               to enabled or not, you can also choose to manu-
                               ally  override  any of the individual style and

                               Specify whether your DVB subtitles are standard
                               or  for  hearing  impaired.  Choose hearing im-
                               paired if your subtitles include audio descrip-
                               tions  and  dialogue.  Choose  standard if your
                               subtitles include only dialogue.

                            TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                               Specify whether the Text spacing (TeletextSpac-
                               ing)  in  your  captions is set by the captions
                               grid, or  varies  depending  on  letter  width.
                               Choose  fixed  grid  (FIXED_GRID) to conform to
                               the spacing specified in the captions file more
                               accurately.  Choose proportional (PROPORTIONAL)
                               to make the text easier to read for closed cap-
                               tions.  Within  your  job settings, all of your

                               Specify  the horizontal position (XPosition) of
                               the captions, relative to the left side of  the
                               outputin  pixels. A value of 10 would result in
                               the captions starting 10 pixels from  the  left
                               ofthe output. If no explicit x_position is pro-
                               vided, the horizontal caption position will be-
                               determined  by  the alignment parameter. Within
                               your job settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings

                               the destination captions for this output.  This
                               value must be a three-digit hexadecimal string;
                               strings ending in -FF are invalid. If  you  are

                            StylePassthrough -> (string)
                               To use the available style, color, and position
                               information from your input captions: Set Style

                               ABLED). MediaConvert uses default settings when
                               style and position information is missing  from
                               your input captions. To recreate the input cap-

                               (STRICT).  MediaConvert  automatically  applies
                               timing adjustments, including  adjustments  for
                               frame  rate  conversion,  ad  avails, and input
                               clipping. Your input captions  format  must  be
                               WebVTT. To ignore the style and position infor-
                               mation from your input captions and use simpli-
                               fied  output captions: Set Style passthrough to
                               Disabled (DISABLED), or leave blank.

                     LanguageCode -> (string)
                        Specify the language of this  captions  output  track.
                        For  most  captions  output  formats, the encoder puts
                        this language information in the output captions meta-
                        data.  If  your  output  captions format is DVB-Sub or
                        Burn in, the encoder uses this language information to
                        choose  the  font  language for rendering the captions
                        text.

                     LanguageDescription -> (string)
                        Specify a label for this set of output  captions.  For
                        example,    "English",   "Director   commentary",   or
                        "track_2". For streaming outputs, MediaConvert  passes
                        this  information  into destination manifests for dis-
                        play on the end-viewer's player device. For outputs in
                        other output groups, the service ignores this setting.

              ContainerSettings -> (structure)
                 Container specific settings.

                 CmfcSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for
                     the segments in your CMAF outputs.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify this setting only when  your  output  will  be
                        consumed  by a downstream repackaging workflow that is
                        sensitive to very small duration  differences  between
                        video  and  audio.  For  this  situation, choose Match
                        video duration (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all  other
                        cases,  keep the default value, Default codec duration
                        (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION). When you choose Match  video
                        duration,  MediaConvert  pads the output audio streams
                        with silence or trims them to ensure  that  the  total
                        duration  of  each audio stream is at least as long as
                        the total duration of the video stream. After  padding
                        or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than
                        one frame longer than the video  stream.  MediaConvert
                        applies  audio  padding or trimming only to the end of
                        the last segment of the output. For  unsegmented  out-
                        puts, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the
                        file. When you keep the default value, any minor  dis-
                        crepancies  between  audio and video duration will de-

                     AudioGroupId -> (string)
                        Specify the audio rendition group for this audio  ren-
                        dition.  Specify up to one value for each audio output
                        in your output group. This value appears in  your  HLS
                        parent  manifest in the EXT-X-MEDIA tag of TYPE=AUDIO,
                        as the value for the GROUP-ID attribute. For  example,
                        if  you  specify  "audio_aac_1" for Audio group ID, it
                        appears  in  your  manifest  like   this:   #EXT-X-ME-
                        DIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="audio_aac_1".   Related  set-

                     AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                        List the audio rendition groups that you want included
                        with this video rendition. Use a comma-separated list.
                        For example, say you want to include the audio  rendi-
                        tion  groups  that  have  the  audio  group  IDs  "au-
                        dio_aac_1" and "audio_dolby". Then you  would  specify
                        this  value:  "audio_aac_1,audio_dolby".  Related set-
                        ting: The rendition groups that you  include  in  your
                        comma-separated  list should all match values that you
                        specify in the setting Audio group  ID  (AudioGroupId)
                        for  audio renditions in the same output group as this
                        video rendition. Default behavior: If you don't  spec-
                        ify anything here and for Audio group ID, MediaConvert
                        puts each audio variant in  its  own  audio  rendition
                        group and associates it with every video variant. Each
                        value in your list appears in your HLS parent manifest
                        in the EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value for the AUDIO
                        attribute. To continue the previous example, say  that
                        the  file  name  for the child manifest for your video
                        rendition is  "amazing_video_1.m3u8".  Then,  in  your
                        parent  manifest,  each  value will appear on separate
                        lines,   like    this:    #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="au-
                        dio_aac_1"...                     amazing_video_1.m3u8

                     AudioTrackType -> (string)
                        Use  this setting to control the values that MediaCon-
                        vert puts in your HLS parent playlist to  control  how
                        the  client  player selects which audio track to play.
                        The other options for this setting determine the  val-
                        ues  that  MediaConvert writes for the DEFAULT and AU-
                        TOSELECT attributes of the EXT-X-MEDIA entry  for  the
                        audio  variant.  For  more information about these at-
                        tributes,  see   the   Apple   documentation   article
                        https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist.
                        Choose Alternate audio, auto select,  default  (ALTER-
                        NATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT_DEFAULT) to set DEFAULT=YES and
                        AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose this value for only one variant
                        in your output group. Choose Alternate audio, auto se-
                        lect, not default (ALTERNATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT) to set
                        DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=YES. Choose Alternate Audio,
                        Not Auto Select to set DEFAULT=NO  and  AUTOSELECT=NO.
                        When you don't specify a value for this setting, Medi-
                        aConvert defaults to Alternate audio, auto select, de-
                        fault.  When  there  is  more than one variant in your
                        output group, you must explicitly choose a  value  for
                        this setting.

                     DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                        Specify  whether  to flag this audio track as descrip-
                        tive video service (DVS) in your HLS parent  manifest.
                        When you choose Flag (FLAG), MediaConvert includes the
                        parameter    CHARACTERISTICS="public.accessibility.de-
                        scribes-video"  in  the  EXT-X-MEDIA  entry  for  this
                        track. When you keep the default  choice,  Don't  flag
                        (DONT_FLAG),  MediaConvert  leaves this parameter out.
                        The DVS flag can help with accessibility on Apple  de-
                        vices.  For more information, see the Apple documenta-
                        tion.

                     IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                        Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have MediaConvert generate
                        an HLS child manifest that lists only the I-frames for
                        this rendition, in addition to your  regular  manifest
                        for  this  rendition.  You  might use this manifest as
                        part of a workflow that creates preview functions  for
                        your  video.  MediaConvert  adds both the I-frame only
                        child manifest and the regular child manifest  to  the
                        parent  manifest. When you don't need the I-frame only
                        child manifest, keep the default  value  Exclude  (EX-
                        CLUDE).

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include  key-length-value metadata in this output:
                        Set KLV metadata insertion to  Passthrough.  MediaCon-
                        vert  reads  KLV  metadata  present  in your input and
                        writes each instance to a separate event  message  box
                        in  the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude
                        this KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata insertion to  None
                        or leave blank.

                     ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                        To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD
                        manifest for each type of event message, set  Manifest
                        metadata signaling to Enabled. For ID3 event messages,
                        the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will be same
                        value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI.
                        For SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream  ele-
                        ment  schemeIdUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
                        To leave these elements out of your output  MPD  mani-
                        fest,  set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled. To
                        enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must also  set
                        SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert,
                        or ID3 metadata (TimedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     Scte35Esam -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers
                        from  ESAM.  Choose  INSERT  to put SCTE-35 markers in
                        this output at the insertion points that  you  specify
                        in  an  ESAM XML document. Provide the document in the
                        setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in
                        your    input    video    file.   Choose   Passthrough
                        (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear
                        in  your  input  to also appear in this output. Choose
                        None (NONE) if you don't want those SCTE-35 markers in
                        this output.

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 meta-
                        data  (timedMetadata)  to  Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH).
                        Specify  this  ID3 metadata in Custom ID3 metadata in-
                        serter (timedMetadataInsertion).  MediaConvert  writes
                        each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate Event Mes-
                        sage (eMSG) box. To exclude this ID3 metadata: Set ID3
                        metadata to None (NONE) or leave blank.

                     TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                        Specify  the  event message box (eMSG) version for ID3
                        timed metadata in your output. For  more  information,
                        see  ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section 5.10.3.3.3 Syntax.
                        Leave blank to use the default value Version  0.  When
                        you  specify Version 1, you must also set ID3 metadata
                        (timedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box  (eMSG)  scheme  ID  URI
                        (scheme_id_uri) for ID3 timed metadata in your output.
                        For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
                        5.10.3.3.4  Semantics.  Leave blank to use the default
                        value: https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a
                        value  for  ID3  metadata scheme ID URI, you must also
                        set ID3 metadata (timedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box  (eMSG)  value  for  ID3
                        timed  metadata  in your output. For more information,
                        see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics.
                        When  you  specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value, you
                        must  also  set  ID3   metadata   (timedMetadata)   to
                        Passthrough.

                 Container -> (string)
                     Container for this output. Some containers require a con-
                     tainer settings object. If not specified, the default ob-
                     ject will be created.

                 F4vSettings -> (structure)
                     Settings for F4v container

                     MoovPlacement -> (string)
                        If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV atom is relo-
                        cated to the beginning of the archive as required  for
                        progressive  downloading.  Otherwise it is placed nor-
                        mally at the end.

                 M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                     MPEG-2 TS container settings. These apply to outputs in a
                     File output group when the output's container (Container-
                     Type) is MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS). In these assets,
                     data  is  organized  by the program map table (PMT). Each
                     transport stream program contains subsets  of  data,  in-
                     cluding audio, video, and metadata. Each of these subsets
                     of data has a numerical label called a packet  identifier
                     (PID).  Each  transport stream program corresponds to one
                     MediaConvert output. The PMT lists the types of data in a
                     program  along  with  their  PID.  Downstream systems and
                     players use the program map table to look up the PID  for
                     each  type  of data it accesses and then uses the PIDs to
                     locate specific data within the asset.

                     AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                        Selects between the DVB and  ATSC  buffer  models  for
                        Dolby Digital audio.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In all other
                        cases, keep the default value, Default codec  duration
                        (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When you choose Match video
                        duration, MediaConvert pads the output  audio  streams
                        with  silence  or  trims them to ensure that the total
                        duration of each audio stream is at least as  long  as
                        the  total duration of the video stream. After padding
                        or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than
                        one  frame  longer than the video stream. MediaConvert
                        applies audio padding or trimming only to the  end  of
                        the  last  segment of the output. For unsegmented out-
                        puts, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the
                        file.  When you keep the default value, any minor dis-
                        crepancies between audio and video duration  will  de-
                        pend on your output audio codec.

                     AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  audio  frames  to insert for each PES
                        packet.

                     AudioPids -> (list)
                        Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for any  elemen-
                        tary audio streams you include in this output. Specify
                        multiple PIDs as a JSON array. Default  is  the  range
                        482-492.

                        (integer)

                     Bitrate -> (integer)
                        Specify  the output bitrate of the transport stream in
                        bits per second. Setting to 0 lets the muxer automati-
                        cally  determine the appropriate bitrate. Other common
                        values are 3750000, 7500000, and 15000000.

                     BufferModel -> (string)
                        Controls what buffer model to use for accurate  inter-
                        leaving.  If  set  to  MULTIPLEX, use multiplex buffer
                        model. If set to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                        but  low-memory  devices  may not be able to play back
                        the stream without interruptions.

                     DataPTSControl -> (string)
                        If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes cap-
                        tions  and  data  packets  with Presentation Timestamp
                        (PTS) values greater than or equal to the first  video
                        packet PTS (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                        ets with lesser PTS values). Keep  the  default  value
                        (AUTO) to allow all PTS values.

                            will  fall  back on the user-defined values. Enter
                            "SDT Manually" means user will enter the  SDT  in-
                            formation.  "No  SDT" means output stream will not
                            contain SDT information.

                        data included in this output. Specify multiple PIDs as
                        a JSON array. Default is the range 460-479.

                        (integer)

                     DvbTdtSettings -> (structure)
                        Use these settings to insert a DVB Time and Date Table
                        (TDT) in the transport stream of this output. When you
                        work  directly in your JSON job specification, include
                        this object only when your job has a transport  stream
                        output  and  the container settings contain the object
                        M2tsSettings.

                        data you include in this output. Default is 499.

                     EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                        When set to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS, audio EBP mark-
                        ers  will be added to partitions 3 and 4. The interval
                        between these additional markers will  be  fixed,  and
                        will be slightly shorter than the video EBP marker in-
                        terval. When set to VIDEO_INTERVAL,  these  additional
                        markers will not be inserted. Only applicable when EBP
                        segmentation markers are  is  selected  (segmentation-
                        Markers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                     EbpPlacement -> (string)
                        Selects  which  PIDs to place EBP markers on. They can
                        either be placed only on the video PID, or on both the
                        video PID and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when EBP
                        segmentation markers are  is  selected  (segmentation-
                        Markers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                     EsRateInPes -> (string)
                        Controls  whether  to include the ES Rate field in the
                        PES header.

                     ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                        Keep the default value (DEFAULT) unless you know  that
                        your  audio  EBP markers are incorrectly appearing be-
                        fore your video EBP markers. To correct this  problem,
                        set this value to Force (FORCE).

                     FragmentTime -> (double)
                        The  length,  in  seconds, of each fragment. Only used
                        with EBP markers.

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To include key-length-value metadata in  this  output:
                        Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough. MediaCon-
                        vert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your  input  and
                        passes  it  through to the output transport stream. To
                        exclude this KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata  insertion
                        to None or leave blank.

                     MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  maximum  time,  in milliseconds, between
                        Program Clock  References  (PCRs)  inserted  into  the
                        transport stream.

                     MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                        When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary Points do not
                        come within the specified time interval of each  other
                        by looking ahead at input video. If another EBP is go-
                        ing to come in within the specified time interval, the
                        current  EBP  is  not  emitted,  and  the  segment  is
                        "stretched" to the next marker.  The  lookahead  value
                        does  not  add  latency  to the system. The Live Event
                        must be configured elsewhere to create sufficient  la-
                        tency to make the lookahead accurate.

                     NielsenId3 -> (string)
                        If  INSERT, Nielsen inaudible tones for media tracking
                        will be detected in the input audio and an  equivalent
                        ID3 tag will be inserted in the output.

                     NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                        Value  in bits per second of extra null packets to in-
                        sert into the transport stream. This can be used if  a
                        downstream  encryption  system  requires periodic null
                        packets.

                     PatInterval -> (integer)
                        The number of milliseconds between instances  of  this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PcrControl -> (string)
                        When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program Clock Ref-
                        erence value is inserted for every Packetized  Elemen-
                        tary  Stream (PES) header. This is effective only when
                        the PCR PID is the same as the video or audio  elemen-
                        tary stream.

                     PcrPid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet  identifier (PID) for the program
                        clock reference (PCR) in this output. If  you  do  not
                        specify  a  value,  the service will use the value for
                        Video PID (VideoPid).

                     PmtInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify the number of milliseconds  between  instances
                        of the program map table (PMT) in the output transport
                        stream.

                     PmtPid -> (integer)
                        Specify the packet identifier (PID)  for  the  program
                        map table (PMT) itself. Default is 480.

                     PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Specify  the  packet  identifier  (PID) of the private
                        metadata stream. Default is 503.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use Program number (programNumber) to specify the pro-
                        gram  number  used  in the program map table (PMT) for
                        this output. Default is 1. Program numbers and program
                        map  tables  are parts of MPEG-2 transport stream con-
                        tainers, used for organizing data.

                     RateMode -> (string)
                        When set to CBR, inserts null packets  into  transport
                        stream to fill specified bitrate. When set to VBR, the
                        bitrate setting acts as the maximum bitrate,  but  the
                        output will not be padded up to that bitrate.

                     Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                        Include this in your job settings to put SCTE-35 mark-
                        ers in your HLS and transport stream  outputs  at  the
                        insertion points that you specify in an ESAM XML docu-
                        ment. Provide the document in the setting SCC XML (sc-
                        cXml).

                        Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream in
                            the transport stream generated by ESAM.

                     Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                        Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of  the  SCTE-35
                        stream in the transport stream.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        For   SCTE-35   markers   from   your  input--  Choose
                        Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35  markers
                        that  appear in your input to also appear in this out-
                        put. Choose None (NONE)  if  you  don't  want  SCTE-35
                        markers  in  this  output. For SCTE-35 markers from an
                        ESAM XML document-- Choose None (NONE).  Also  provide
                        the  ESAM  XML  as a string in the setting Signal pro-
                        cessing notification XML (sccXml).  Also  enable  ESAM
                        SCTE-35 (include the property scte35Esam).

                     SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                        Inserts segmentation markers at each segmentation_time
                        period. rai_segstart sets the Random Access  Indicator
                        bit  in  the  adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the RAI
                        bit and adds the current timecode in the private  data
                        bytes.  psi_segstart inserts PAT and PMT tables at the
                        start of segments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point in-
                        formation  to  the  adaptation  field as per OpenCable
                        specification  OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118.  ebp_legacy  adds
                        Encoder  Boundary  Point information to the adaptation
                        field using a legacy proprietary format.

                     SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                        The segmentation style parameter controls how  segmen-
                        tation markers are inserted into the transport stream.
                        With avails, it is possible that segments may be trun-
                        cated,  which  can influence where future segmentation
                        markers are inserted. When  a  segmentation  style  of
                        "reset_cadence" is selected and a segment is truncated
                        due to an avail, we will reset  the  segmentation  ca-
                        dence.  This  means the subsequent segment will have a
                        duration of of $segmentation_time seconds. When a seg-
                        mentation  style of "maintain_cadence" is selected and
                        a segment is truncated due to an avail,  we  will  not
                        reset  the segmentation cadence. This means the subse-
                        quent segment will likely be truncated as  well.  How-
                        ever,  all segments after that will have a duration of
                        $segmentation_time seconds. Note that EBP lookahead is
                        a slight exception to this rule.

                     SegmentationTime -> (double)
                        Specify  the  length, in seconds, of each segment. Re-
                        quired unless markers is set to _none_.

                     TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream  in
                        the transport stream.

                     TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                        Specify  the ID for the transport stream itself in the
                        program map table for this  output.  Transport  stream
                        IDs  and program map tables are parts of MPEG-2 trans-
                        port stream containers, used for organizing data.

                     VideoPid -> (integer)
                        Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the  elementary
                        video stream in the transport stream.

                 M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                     These  settings  relate  to  the  MPEG-2 transport stream
                     (MPEG2-TS) container for the MPEG2-TS  segments  in  your
                     HLS outputs.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In all other
                        cases, keep the default value, Default codec  duration
                        (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When you choose Match video
                        duration, MediaConvert pads the output  audio  streams
                        with  silence  or  trims them to ensure that the total
                        duration of each audio stream is at least as  long  as
                        the  total duration of the video stream. After padding
                        or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than
                        one  frame  longer than the video stream. MediaConvert
                        applies audio padding or trimming only to the  end  of
                        the  last  segment of the output. For unsegmented out-
                        puts, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the
                        file.  When you keep the default value, any minor dis-
                        crepancies between audio and video duration  will  de-
                        pend on your output audio codec.

                     AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  audio  frames  to insert for each PES
                        packet.

                     AudioPids -> (list)
                        Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of  the  elementary   audio
                        stream(s) in the transport stream. Multiple values are
                        accepted, and can be entered in ranges and/or by comma
                        separation.

                        (integer)

                     DataPTSControl -> (string)
                        If you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes cap-
                        tions and data  packets  with  Presentation  Timestamp
                        (PTS)  values greater than or equal to the first video
                        packet PTS (MediaConvert drops captions and data pack-
                        ets  with  lesser  PTS values). Keep the default value
                        (AUTO) to allow all PTS values.

                     MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                        Specify the maximum  time,  in  milliseconds,  between
                        Program  Clock  References  (PCRs)  inserted  into the
                        transport stream.

                     NielsenId3 -> (string)
                        If INSERT, Nielsen inaudible tones for media  tracking
                        will  be detected in the input audio and an equivalent
                        ID3 tag will be inserted in the output.

                     PatInterval -> (integer)
                        The number of milliseconds between instances  of  this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PcrControl -> (string)
                        When  set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Program Clock Ref-
                        erence value is inserted for every Packetized  Elemen-
                        tary  Stream (PES) header. This parameter is effective
                        only when the PCR PID is the same as the video or  au-
                        dio elementary stream.

                     PcrPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the Program Clock Reference
                        (PCR) in the transport stream. When no value is given,
                        the  encoder  will  assign the same value as the Video
                        PID.

                     PmtInterval -> (integer)
                        The number of milliseconds between instances  of  this
                        table in the output transport stream.

                     PmtPid -> (integer)
                        Packet  Identifier  (PID)  for  the  Program Map Table
                        (PMT) in the transport stream.

                     PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the private metadata stream
                        in the transport stream.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        The  value  of the program number field in the Program
                        Map Table.

                     Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream  in  the
                        transport stream.

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        For   SCTE-35   markers   from   your  input--  Choose
                        Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35  markers
                        that  appear in your input to also appear in this out-
                        put. Choose None (NONE)  if  you  don't  want  SCTE-35
                        markers  in  this  output. For SCTE-35 markers from an
                        ESAM XML document-- Choose None (NONE)  if  you  don't
                        want   manifest   conditioning.   Choose   Passthrough
                        (PASSTHROUGH) and choose Ad markers (adMarkers) if you
                        do  want  manifest  conditioning.  In both cases, also
                        provide the ESAM XML as a string in the setting Signal
                        processing notification XML (sccXml).

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        Set   ID3   metadata  (timedMetadata)  to  Passthrough
                        (PASSTHROUGH) to include ID3 metadata in this  output.
                        This  includes  ID3  metadata  from the following fea-
                        tures: ID3 timestamp period  (timedMetadataId3Period),
                        and  Custom ID3 metadata inserter (timedMetadataInser-
                        tion). To exclude this ID3 metadata  in  this  output:
                        set ID3 metadata to None (NONE) or leave blank.

                     TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                        Packet  Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream in
                        the transport stream.

                     TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                        The value of the transport stream ID field in the Pro-
                        gram Map Table.

                     VideoPid -> (integer)
                        Packet Identifier (PID) of the elementary video stream
                        in the transport stream.

                 MovSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to your QuickTime MOV  output  con-
                     tainer.

                     ClapAtom -> (string)
                        When  enabled,  include 'clap' atom if appropriate for
                        the video output settings.

                     CslgAtom -> (string)
                        When enabled, file composition  times  will  start  at
                        zero,  composition  times  in  the 'ctts' (composition
                        time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative, and
                        a  'cslg'  (composition shift least greatest) box will
                        be included per 14496-1  amendment  1.  This  improves
                        compatibility with Apple players and tools.

                     Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                        When set to XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video streams into the
                        QuickTime file using  XDCAM  fourcc  codes.  This  in-
                        creases  compatibility with Apple editors and players,
                        but may decrease  compatibility  with  other  players.
                        Only applicable when the video codec is MPEG2.

                     PaddingControl -> (string)
                        Unless you need Omneon compatibility: Keep the default
                        value, None. To make this output compatible  with  Om-
                        neon:  Choose  Omneon.  When  you do, MediaConvert in-
                        creases the length of the 'elst' edit list atom.  Note
                        that this might cause file rejections when a recipient
                        of the output file doesn't expect this extra padding.

                     Reference -> (string)
                        Always keep the  default  value  (SELF_CONTAINED)  for
                        this setting.

                 Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                     These  settings  relate to your MP4 output container. You
                     can create audio only outputs with  this  container.  For
                     more                   information,                   see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/supported-codecs-containers-audio-only.html#output-codecs-and-containers-supported-for-audio-only.

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In all other
                        cases, keep the default value, Default codec  duration
                        (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When you choose Match video
                        duration, MediaConvert pads the output  audio  streams
                        with  silence  or  trims them to ensure that the total
                        duration of each audio stream is at least as  long  as
                        the  total duration of the video stream. After padding
                        or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than
                        one  frame  longer than the video stream. MediaConvert
                        applies audio padding or trimming only to the  end  of
                        the  last  segment of the output. For unsegmented out-
                        puts, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the
                        file.  When you keep the default value, any minor dis-
                        crepancies between audio and video duration  will  de-
                        pend on your output audio codec.

                     CslgAtom -> (string)
                        When  enabled,  file  composition  times will start at
                        zero, composition times  in  the  'ctts'  (composition
                        time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative, and
                        a 'cslg' (composition shift least greatest)  box  will
                        be  included  per  14496-1  amendment 1. This improves
                        compatibility with Apple players and tools.

                     CttsVersion -> (integer)
                        Ignore this setting unless compliance to the CTTS  box
                        version  specification matters in your workflow. Spec-
                        ify a value of 1 to set your CTTS box version to 1 and
                        make  your  output  compliant  with the specification.
                        When you specify a value of 1, you must also set  CSLG
                        atom (cslgAtom) to the value INCLUDE. Keep the default
                        value 0 to set your CTTS box version to  0.  This  can
                        provide  backward  compatibility  for some players and
                        packagers.

                     FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                        Inserts a free-space box immediately  after  the  moov
                        box.

                     MoovPlacement -> (string)
                        If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV atom is relo-
                        cated to the beginning of the archive as required  for
                        progressive  downloading.  Otherwise it is placed nor-
                        mally at the end.

                     Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                        Overrides the "Major Brand" field in the output  file.
                        Usually not necessary to specify.

                 MpdSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container for
                     the segments in your DASH outputs.

                     AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                        Optional. Choose Include (INCLUDE) to  have  MediaCon-
                        vert  mark up your DASH manifest with elements for em-
                        bedded 608 captions. This markup isn't  generally  re-
                        quired,  but some video players require it to discover
                        and play  embedded  608  captions.  Keep  the  default
                        value, Exclude (EXCLUDE), to leave these elements out.
                        When you enable this setting, this is the markup  that
                        MediaConvert includes in your manifest:

                     AudioDuration -> (string)
                        Specify  this  setting  only  when your output will be
                        consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that  is
                        sensitive  to  very small duration differences between
                        video and audio.  For  this  situation,  choose  Match
                        video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In all other
                        cases, keep the default value, Default codec  duration
                        (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).  When you choose Match video
                        duration, MediaConvert pads the output  audio  streams
                        with  silence  or  trims them to ensure that the total
                        duration of each audio stream is at least as  long  as
                        the  total duration of the video stream. After padding
                        or trimming, the audio stream duration is no more than
                        one  frame  longer than the video stream. MediaConvert
                        applies audio padding or trimming only to the  end  of
                        the  last  segment of the output. For unsegmented out-
                        puts, MediaConvert adds padding only to the end of the
                        file.  When you keep the default value, any minor dis-
                        crepancies between audio and video duration  will  de-
                        pend on your output audio codec.

                     CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                        Use  this  setting only in DASH output groups that in-
                        clude sidecar TTML or IMSC captions. You specify side-
                        car  captions in a separate output from your audio and
                        video. Choose Raw (RAW) for captions in a  single  XML
                        file  in  a  raw  container.  Choose Fragmented MPEG-4
                        (FRAGMENTED_MP4) for captions in XML format  contained
                        within  fragmented  MP4  files. This set of fragmented
                        MP4 files is separate from your video and audio  frag-
                        mented MP4 files.

                     KlvMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include  key-length-value metadata in this output:
                        Set KLV metadata insertion to  Passthrough.  MediaCon-
                        vert  reads  KLV  metadata  present  in your input and
                        writes each instance to a separate event  message  box
                        in  the output, according to MISB ST1910.1. To exclude
                        this KLV metadata: Set KLV metadata insertion to  None
                        or leave blank.

                     ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                        To add an InbandEventStream element in your output MPD
                        manifest for each type of event message, set  Manifest
                        metadata signaling to Enabled. For ID3 event messages,
                        the InbandEventStream element schemeIdUri will be same
                        value that you specify for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI.
                        For SCTE35 event messages, the InbandEventStream  ele-
                        ment  schemeIdUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin".
                        To leave these elements out of your output  MPD  mani-
                        fest,  set Manifest metadata signaling to Disabled. To
                        enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must also  set
                        SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to insert,
                        or ID3 metadata (TimedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     Scte35Esam -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when you specify SCTE-35 markers
                        from  ESAM.  Choose  INSERT  to put SCTE-35 markers in
                        this output at the insertion points that  you  specify
                        in  an  ESAM XML document. Provide the document in the
                        setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                     Scte35Source -> (string)
                        Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35 markers in
                        your    input    video    file.   Choose   Passthrough
                        (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear
                        in  your  input  to also appear in this output. Choose
                        None (NONE) if you don't want those SCTE-35 markers in
                        this output.

                     TimedMetadata -> (string)
                        To  include ID3 metadata in this output: Set ID3 meta-
                        data  (timedMetadata)  to  Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH).
                        Specify  this  ID3 metadata in Custom ID3 metadata in-
                        serter (timedMetadataInsertion).  MediaConvert  writes
                        each instance of ID3 metadata in a separate Event Mes-
                        sage (eMSG) box. To exclude this ID3 metadata: Set ID3
                        metadata to None (NONE) or leave blank.

                     TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                        Specify  the  event message box (eMSG) version for ID3
                        timed metadata in your output. For  more  information,
                        see  ISO/IEC  23009-1:2022  section 5.10.3.3.3 Syntax.
                        Leave blank to use the default value Version  0.  When
                        you  specify Version 1, you must also set ID3 metadata
                        (timedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box  (eMSG)  scheme  ID  URI
                        (scheme_id_uri) for ID3 timed metadata in your output.
                        For more information, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section
                        5.10.3.3.4  Semantics.  Leave blank to use the default
                        value: https://aomedia.org/emsg/ID3 When you specify a
                        value  for  ID3  metadata scheme ID URI, you must also
                        set ID3 metadata (timedMetadata) to Passthrough.

                     TimedMetadataValue -> (string)
                        Specify the event message box  (eMSG)  value  for  ID3
                        timed  metadata  in your output. For more information,
                        see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section 5.10.3.3.4 Semantics.
                        When  you  specify a value for ID3 Metadata Value, you
                        must  also  set  ID3   metadata   (timedMetadata)   to
                        Passthrough.

                 MxfSettings -> (structure)
                     These settings relate to your MXF output container.

                     AfdSignaling -> (string)
                        Optional.  When  you have AFD signaling set up in your
                        output  video  stream,  use  this  setting  to  choose
                        whether  to also include it in the MXF wrapper. Choose
                        Don't copy (NO_COPY) to exclude AFD signaling from the
                        MXF   wrapper.   Choose   Copy   from   video   stream
                        (COPY_FROM_VIDEO) to copy  the  AFD  values  from  the
                        video  stream  for this output to the MXF wrapper. Re-
                        gardless of which option you choose,  the  AFD  values
                        remain  in  the video stream. Related settings: To set
                        up your output to include or exclude AFD  values,  see
                        AfdSignaling,  under VideoDescription. On the console,
                        find AFD signaling under the output's  video  encoding
                        settings.

                     Profile -> (string)
                        Specify  the  MXF  profile, also called shim, for this
                        output. When you choose Auto, MediaConvert  chooses  a
                        profile based on the video codec and resolution. For a
                        list of codecs supported with each  MXF  profile,  see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/codecs-supported-with-each-mxf-profile.html.

                     XavcProfileSettings -> (structure)
                        Specify the XAVC profile settings for MXF outputs when
                        you set your MXF profile to XAVC.

                        DurationMode -> (string)
                            To create an output that complies  with  the  XAVC
                            file  format guidelines for interoperability, keep
                            the default  value,  Drop  frames  for  compliance
                            (DROP_FRAMES_FOR_COMPLIANCE).   To   include   all
                            frames from your input in this  output,  keep  the
                            default setting, Allow any duration (ALLOW_ANY_DU-
                            RATION). The number of  frames  that  MediaConvert
                            excludes when you set this to Drop frames for com-
                            pliance depends on the output frame rate and dura-
                            tion.

                        MaxAncDataSize -> (integer)
                            Specify  a value for this setting only for outputs
                            that you set up with one of these  two  XAVC  pro-
                            files:  XAVC  HD  Intra CBG (XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG) or
                            XAVC 4K Intra CBG (XAVC_4K_INTRA_CBG). Specify the
                            amount of space in each frame that the service re-
                            serves for ancillary data, such as  teletext  cap-
                            tions.  The default value for this setting is 1492
                            bytes per frame. This should be sufficient to pre-
                            vent  overflow  unless  you have multiple pages of
                            teletext captions data. If you have a large amount
                            of teletext data, specify a larger number.

              VideoDescription -> (structure)
                 VideoDescription contains a group of video encoding settings.
                 The specific video settings depend on the  video  codec  that
                 you  choose  for  the property codec. Include one instance of
                 VideoDescription per output.

                 AfdSignaling -> (string)
                     This setting only applies to H.264, H.265, and MPEG2 out-
                     puts.  Use Insert AFD signaling (AfdSignaling) to specify
                     whether the service includes AFD  values  in  the  output
                     video  data  and  what those values are. * Choose None to
                     remove all AFD values from this output. * Choose Fixed to
                     ignore  input  AFD  values  and  instead encode the value
                     specified in the job. * Choose Auto to  calculate  output
                     AFD values based on the input AFD scaler data.

                 AntiAlias -> (string)
                     The  anti-alias  filter  is  automatically applied to all
                     outputs. The service no longer accepts the value DISABLED
                     for  AntiAlias. If you specify that in your job, the ser-
                     vice will ignore the setting.

                 CodecSettings -> (structure)
                     Video codec  settings,  (CodecSettings)  under  (VideoDe-
                     scription),  contains  the  group  of settings related to
                     video encoding. The settings in this group vary depending
                     on the value that you choose for Video codec (Codec). For
                     each codec enum that you choose, define the corresponding
                     settings object. The following lists the codec enum, set-
                     tings object  pairs.  *  AV1,  Av1Settings  *  AVC_INTRA,
                     AvcIntraSettings  * FRAME_CAPTURE, FrameCaptureSettings *
                     H_264,  H264Settings  *  H_265,  H265Settings  *   MPEG2,
                     Mpeg2Settings * PRORES, ProresSettings * VC3, Vc3Settings
                     * VP8, Vp8Settings * VP9, Vp9Settings  *  XAVC,  XavcSet-
                     tings

                     Av1Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  Codec,  under  VideoDescrip-
                        tion>CodecSettings to the value AV1.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Specify the strength of any adaptive  quantization
                            filters that you enable. The value that you choose
                            here  applies  to  Spatial  adaptive  quantization
                            (spatialAdaptiveQuantization).

                        BitDepth -> (string)
                            Specify  the  Bit  depth  (Av1BitDepth).  You  can
                            choose 8-bit (BIT_8) or 10-bit (BIT_10).

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console,  use  the  Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown in the dropdown list are decimal  approxima-
                            tions  of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your  transcoding job specification as a JSON file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify  which  value  the  service uses for the frame
                            rate   for   this    output.    Choose    INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in the settings FramerateNumerator and  Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Specify the  GOP  length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                            frames. With AV1, MediaConvert doesn't support GOP
                            length in seconds. This value must be greater than
                            zero and preferably equal to 1 + ((numberBFrames +
                            1) * x), where x is an integer value.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify from the number of B-frames, in the  range
                            of 0-15. For AV1 encoding, we recommend using 7 or
                            15. Choose a larger number for a lower bitrate and
                            smaller  file  size;  choose  a smaller number for
                            better video quality.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate  en-
                            coding  with  the  H.265 codec. Use these settings
                            only when you  set  QVBR  for  Rate  control  mode
                            (RateControlMode).

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.  Specify  the
                               target quality level for this output. MediaCon-
                               vert determines the right number of bits to use
                               for  each  part  of  the  video to maintain the
                               video quality that you specify. When  you  keep
                               the  default  value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks a
                               quality level for you, based on characteristics
                               of your input video. If you prefer to specify a
                               quality level, specify a number from 1  through
                               10.  Use  higher  numbers  for greater quality.
                               Level 10 results in  nearly  lossless  compres-
                               sion.   The   quality  level  for  most  broad-
                               cast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Op-
                               tionally, to specify a value between whole num-
                               bers, also provide  a  value  for  the  setting
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.  For  example, if you
                               want your QVBR quality level to  be  7.33,  set
                               qvbrQualityLevel   to   7   and  set  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional. Specify a value here to set the  QVBR
                               quality  to  a level that is between whole num-
                               bers. For example, if you want your QVBR  qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert  rounds  your QVBR quality level to the
                               nearest third of a whole number.  For  example,
                               if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your  actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            'With  AV1  outputs, for rate control mode, Media-
                            Convert supports only quality-defined variable bi-
                            trate (QVBR). You can''t use CBR or VBR.'

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  number  of  slices per picture. This
                            value must be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For  progres-
                            sive  pictures,  this  value  must be less than or
                            equal to the number of macroblock rows. For inter-
                            laced  pictures,  this  value must be less than or
                            equal to half the number of macroblock rows.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to  ad-
                            just  quantization within each frame based on spa-
                            tial variation of content complexity. When you en-
                            able  this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on
                            areas that can sustain more distortion with no no-
                            ticeable  visual degradation and uses more bits on
                            areas where any small distortion will  be  notice-
                            able. For example, complex textured blocks are en-
                            coded with fewer bits and smooth  textured  blocks
                            are  encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature
                            will almost always  improve  your  video  quality.
                            Note,  though, that this feature doesn't take into
                            account where the viewer's attention is likely  to
                            be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                            tention on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                            plex  texture,  you  might  choose to disable this
                            feature. Related setting: When you enable  spatial
                            adaptive  quantization, set the value for Adaptive
                            quantization (adaptiveQuantization)  depending  on
                            your  content.  For  homogeneous  content, such as
                            cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For  con-
                            tent  with  a wider variety of textures, set it to
                            High or Higher.

                     AvcIntraSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you choose  AVC-Intra  for  your  output
                        video  codec. For more information about the AVC-Intra
                        settings, see the relevant specification. For detailed
                        information   about   SD  and  HD  in  AVC-Intra,  see
                        https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7290936. For  in-
                        formation    about    4K/2K    in    AVC-Intra,    see
                        https://pro-av.panasonic.net/en/avc-ultra/AVC-ULTRAoverview.pdf.

                        AvcIntraClass -> (string)
                            Specify  the  AVC-Intra  class of your output. The
                            AVC-Intra class selection  determines  the  output
                            video  bit rate depending on the frame rate of the
                            output. Outputs  with  higher  class  values  have
                            higher  bitrates  and improved image quality. Note
                            that for Class 4K/2K, MediaConvert  supports  only
                            4:2:2 chroma subsampling.

                        AvcIntraUhdSettings -> (structure)
                            Optional  when  you set AVC-Intra class (avcIntra-
                            Class) to Class 4K/2K (CLASS_4K_2K). When you  set
                            AVC-Intra  class to a different value, this object
                            isn't allowed.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how many transcoding passes
                               MediaConvert does with  your  video.  When  you
                               choose   Multi-pass  (MULTI_PASS),  your  video
                               quality is better and your  output  bitrate  is
                               more  accurate.  That is, the actual bitrate of
                               your output is closer to the target bitrate de-
                               fined  in  the  specification.  When you choose
                               Single-pass (SINGLE_PASS), your  encoding  time
                               is  faster. The default behavior is Single-pass
                               (SINGLE_PASS).

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console,  use  the  Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown in the dropdown list are decimal  approxima-
                            tions  of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your  transcoding job specification as a JSON file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify  which  value  the  service uses for the frame
                            rate   for   this    output.    Choose    INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in the settings FramerateNumerator and  Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to create
                            a progressive output, regardless of the scan  type
                            of  your input. Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or
                            Bottom field first  (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to  create  an
                            output  that's  interlaced with the same field po-
                            larity throughout. Use Follow, default  top  (FOL-
                            LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default  bottom (FOL-
                            LOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same
                            field  polarity  as the source. For jobs that have
                            multiple inputs, the output field  polarity  might
                            change  over  the course of the output. Follow be-
                            havior depends on the  input  scan  type.  If  the
                            source  is  interlaced,  the output will be inter-
                            laced with the same polarity as the source. If the
                            source  is  progressive, the output will be inter-
                            laced with top field bottom field first, depending
                            on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive frame from the input  corresponds  to  an
                            interlaced  field  in the output. Keep the default
                            value, Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                            other  output frame rates. With basic interlacing,
                            MediaConvert performs any  frame  rate  conversion
                            first  and  then  interlaces  the frames. When you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put  frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for
                            optimized interlacing, MediaConvert  automatically
                            falls  back  to  basic  interlacing. Required set-
                            tings: To use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode) to a value other than  Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate  to  25. In your JSON job specification,
                            set (framerateControl)  to  (SPECIFIED),  (framer-
                            ateNumerator)  to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                            1.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable  hard  telecine (HARD) to create a smoother
                            picture. When you keep  the  default  value,  None
                            (NONE),  MediaConvert  does  a standard frame rate
                            conversion to 29.97 without  doing  anything  with
                            the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                     Codec -> (string)
                        Specifies  the  video codec. This must be equal to one
                        of the enum values defined by the  object  VideoCodec.
                        To   passthrough   the  video  stream  of  your  input
                        JPEG2000, VC-3, AVC-INTRA or Apple ProRes video  with-
                        out  any  video  encoding:  Choose Passthrough. If you
                        have multiple input videos, note that they  must  have
                        identical   encoding   attributes.   When  you  choose
                        Passthrough, your output  container  must  be  MXF  or
                        QuickTime MOV.

                     FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value FRAME_CAPTURE.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            Frame capture will encode the first frame  of  the
                            output  stream,  then one frame every framerateDe-
                            nominator/framerateNumerator seconds. For example,
                            settings  of framerateNumerator = 1 and framerate-
                            Denominator = 3 (a rate of 1/3 frame  per  second)
                            will  capture  the first frame, then 1 frame every
                            3s. Files will be named as filename.n.jpg where  n
                            is the 0-based sequence number of each Capture.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            Frame  capture  will encode the first frame of the
                            output stream, then one frame  every  framerateDe-
                            nominator/framerateNumerator seconds. For example,
                            settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and  framerate-
                            Denominator  =  3 (a rate of 1/3 frame per second)
                            will capture the first frame, then 1  frame  every
                            3s.  Files  will  be named as filename.NNNNNNN.jpg
                            where N is the 0-based frame sequence number  zero
                            padded to 7 decimal places.

                        MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                            Maximum  number  of  captures  (encoded jpg output
                            files).

                        Quality -> (integer)
                            JPEG Quality - a higher value equals higher  qual-
                            ity.

                     H264Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value H_264.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for this set-
                            ting  to have MediaConvert automatically apply the
                            best types of quantization for your video content.
                            When  you want to apply your quantization settings
                            manually, you must set H264AdaptiveQuantization to
                            a  value  other than Auto (AUTO). Use this setting
                            to specify the strength of any adaptive  quantiza-
                            tion  filters  that  you enable. If you don't want
                            MediaConvert to do any  adaptive  quantization  in
                            this    transcode,   set   Adaptive   quantization
                            (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to Off  (OFF).  Related
                            settings:  The  value that you choose here applies
                            to the  following  settings:  H264FlickerAdaptive-
                            Quantization, H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization, and
                            H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization.

                        BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                            The Bandwidth reduction filter increases the video
                            quality  of  your  output relative to its bitrate.
                            Use to lower the bitrate of your constant  quality
                            QVBR output, with little or no perceptual decrease
                            in quality. Or, use to increase the video  quality
                            of  outputs with other rate control modes relative
                            to the bitrate that you specify. Bandwidth  reduc-
                            tion  increases  further  when  your  input is low
                            quality or noisy. Outputs that  use  this  feature
                            incur pro-tier pricing. When you include Bandwidth
                            reduction filter, you cannot include the Noise re-
                            ducer preprocessor.

                            Sharpening -> (string)
                               Optionally  specify  the level of sharpening to
                               apply when you use the Bandwidth reduction fil-
                               ter.  Sharpening  adds contrast to the edges of
                               your video content  and  can  reduce  softness.
                               Keep the default value Off to apply no sharpen-
                               ing. Set Sharpening strength to Low to apply  a
                               minimal  amount of sharpening, or High to apply
                               a maximum amount of sharpening.

                            Strength -> (string)
                               Specify the strength of the Bandwidth reduction
                               filter.  For  most workflows, we recommend that
                               you choose Auto to reduce the bandwidth of your
                               output with little to no perceptual decrease in
                               video quality. For high quality  and  high  bi-
                               trate  outputs,  choose Low. For the most band-
                               width reduction, choose High. We recommend that
                               you  choose  High for low bitrate outputs. Note
                               that High may incur a slight  increase  in  the
                               softness of your output.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  average  bitrate in bits per second.
                            Required for VBR and CBR. For MS  Smooth  outputs,
                            bitrates  must  be unique when rounded down to the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            Specify an H.264 level  that  is  consistent  with
                            your  output  video  settings.  If you aren't sure
                            what level to specify, choose Auto (AUTO).

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            H.264 Profile. High 4:2:2 and 10-bit profiles  are
                            only available with the AVC-I License.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow the number of B-frames in
                            your output GOP structure to vary or not depending
                            on  your  input video content. To improve the sub-
                            jective video quality  of  your  output  that  has
                            high-motion  content:  Leave blank or keep the de-
                            fault value Adaptive. MediaConvert will use  fewer
                            B-frames   for   high-motion  video  content  than
                            low-motion  content.  The  maximum  number  of  B-
                            frames is limited by the value that you choose for
                            B-frames between reference frames. To use the same
                            number  B-frames  for all types of content: Choose
                            Static.

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Entropy encoding mode. Use CABAC (must be in  Main
                            or High profile) or CAVLC.

                        FieldEncoding -> (string)
                            The video encoding method for your MPEG-4 AVC out-
                            put. Keep the default value, PAFF, to have  Media-
                            Convert  use PAFF encoding for interlaced outputs.
                            Choose Force field (FORCE_FIELD) to  disable  PAFF
                            encoding  and  create  separate interlaced fields.
                            Choose MBAFF to disable PAFF and have MediaConvert
                            use MBAFF encoding for interlaced outputs.

                        FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only  use this setting when you change the default
                            value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion.   When  you  keep  all  defaults,  excluding
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization and  all  other  adaptive
                            quantization from your JSON job specification, Me-
                            diaConvert automatically applies the best types of
                            quantization  for your video content. When you set
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization to  a  value  other  than
                            AUTO,  the  default value for H264FlickerAdaptive-
                            Quantization is Disabled (DISABLED).  Change  this
                            value  to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop.
                            I-frame pop appears as a visual flicker  that  can
                            arise  when the encoder saves bits by copying some
                            macroblocks many times from frame  to  frame,  and
                            then  refreshes  them at the I-frame. When you en-
                            able this setting, the encoder updates these  mac-
                            roblocks  slightly  more  often  to smooth out the
                            flicker. To manually enable or disable  H264Flick-
                            erAdaptiveQuantization,   you  must  set  Adaptive
                            quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantization) to a value
                            other than AUTO.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your transcoding job specification as a JSON  file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify which value the service  uses  for  the  frame
                            rate    for    this    output.   Choose   INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in  the settings FramerateNumerator and Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow B-frames to be referenced
                            by other frame types. To  use  reference  B-frames
                            when  your  GOP  structure has 1 or more B-frames:
                            Leave blank or keep the default value Enabled.  We
                            recommend  that you choose Enabled to help improve
                            the video quality of your output relative  to  its
                            bitrate.  To  not  use  reference B-frames: Choose
                            Disabled.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify the relative frequency of open  to  closed
                            GOPs  in  this output. For example, if you want to
                            allow four open GOPs and  then  require  a  closed
                            GOP,  set  this  value to 5. We recommend that you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put video. To enable this automatic behavior, keep
                            the  default  value by leaving this setting out of
                            your JSON job specification. In  the  console,  do
                            this by keeping the default empty value. If you do
                            explicitly specify a value, for segmented outputs,
                            don't set this value to 0.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Use  this  setting only when you set GOP mode con-
                            trol (GopSizeUnits) to Specified, frames  (FRAMES)
                            or  Specified,  seconds (SECONDS). Specify the GOP
                            length using a whole number of frames or a decimal
                            value of seconds. MediaConvert will interpret this
                            value as frames or seconds depending on the  value
                            you choose for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                            you want to allow  MediaConvert  to  automatically
                            determine  GOP  size, leave GOP size blank and set
                            GOP mode control to Auto (AUTO).  If  your  output
                            group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP size
                            blank and set GOP mode control  to  Auto  in  each
                            output in your output group.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify how the transcoder determines GOP size for
                            this  output.  We  recommend  that  you  have  the
                            transcoder automatically choose this value for you
                            based on characteristics of your input  video.  To
                            enable this automatic behavior, choose Auto (AUTO)
                            and and leave GOP size  (GopSize)  blank.  By  de-
                            fault, if you don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                            SizeUnits), MediaConvert will use automatic behav-
                            ior.  If your output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                            CMAF, set GOP mode control to Auto and  leave  GOP
                            size blank in each output in your output group. To
                            explicitly specify the GOP length,  choose  Speci-
                            fied,  frames (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SEC-
                            ONDS) and then provide the GOP length in  the  re-
                            lated setting GOP size (GopSize).

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If  your downstream systems have strict buffer re-
                            quirements: Specify the minimum percentage of  the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded video segment. For the best  video  quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage of the buffer that should initially  be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to create
                            a progressive output, regardless of the scan  type
                            of  your input. Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or
                            Bottom field first  (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to  create  an
                            output  that's  interlaced with the same field po-
                            larity throughout. Use Follow, default  top  (FOL-
                            LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default  bottom (FOL-
                            LOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same
                            field  polarity  as the source. For jobs that have
                            multiple inputs, the output field  polarity  might
                            change  over  the course of the output. Follow be-
                            havior depends on the  input  scan  type.  If  the
                            source  is  interlaced,  the output will be inter-
                            laced with the same polarity as the source. If the
                            source  is  progressive, the output will be inter-
                            laced with top field bottom field first, depending
                            on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting only when you also enable Scene
                            change detection (SceneChangeDetect). This setting
                            determines how the encoder manages the spacing be-
                            tween I-frames that it  inserts  as  part  of  the
                            I-frame  cadence  and the I-frames that it inserts
                            for Scene change detection. We recommend that  you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put video. To enable this automatic behavior, keep
                            the default value by leaving this setting  out  of
                            your  JSON  job  specification. In the console, do
                            this by keeping the default empty value. When  you
                            explicitly  specify  a value for this setting, the
                            encoder  determines  whether   to   skip   a   ca-
                            dence-driven I-frame by the value you set. For ex-
                            ample, if you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to
                            5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                            frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder
                            skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one
                            GOP is shrunk slightly and one  GOP  is  stretched
                            slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven  I-frames are
                            farther from the  scene-change  I-frame  than  the
                            value   you  set,  then  the  encoder  leaves  all
                            I-frames in place and  the  GOPs  surrounding  the
                            scene  change  are  smaller than the usual cadence
                            GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of B-frames  between  reference
                            frames in this output. For the best video quality:
                            Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines
                            the number of B-frames to use based on the charac-
                            teristics of your input video. To manually specify
                            the  number  of B-frames between reference frames:
                            Enter an integer from 0 to 7.

                        NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use  more  than requested if using B-frames and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault   behavior,    Follow    source    (INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses  the  PAR  from your input
                            video for your output. To specify a different  PAR
                            in the console, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. To specify a different PAR by editing  the
                            JSON job specification, choose SPECIFIED. When you
                            choose SPECIFIED for this setting, you  must  also
                            specify values for the parNumerator and parDenomi-
                            nator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            The Quality tuning level you choose  represents  a
                            trade-off  between  the encoding speed of your job
                            and the output video quality. For the fastest  en-
                            coding  speed at the cost of video quality: Choose
                            Single pass. For a good balance  between  encoding
                            speed  and  video quality: Leave blank or keep the
                            default value Single pass HQ. For the  best  video
                            quality,  at  the  cost  of encoding speed: Choose
                            Multi pass HQ. MediaConvert performs  an  analysis
                            pass  on  your input followed by an encoding pass.
                            Outputs that use this feature incur pro-tier pric-
                            ing.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  for quality-defined variable bitrate en-
                            coding with the H.265 codec.  Use  these  settings
                            only  when  you  set  QVBR  for  Rate control mode
                            (RateControlMode).

                            MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when Rate control mode is
                               QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ.
                               For Max average bitrate values  suited  to  the
                               complexity  of  your  input  video, the service
                               limits the average bitrate of the video part of
                               this  output to the value that you choose. That
                               is, the total size of the video element is less
                               than  or  equal to the value you set multiplied
                               by the number of seconds of encoded output.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode  (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.  Specify the
                               target quality level for this output. MediaCon-
                               vert determines the right number of bits to use
                               for each part of  the  video  to  maintain  the
                               video  quality  that you specify. When you keep
                               the default value, AUTO, MediaConvert  picks  a
                               quality level for you, based on characteristics
                               of your input video. If you prefer to specify a
                               quality  level, specify a number from 1 through
                               10. Use higher  numbers  for  greater  quality.
                               Level  10  results  in nearly lossless compres-
                               sion.  The  quality  level  for   most   broad-
                               cast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Op-
                               tionally, to specify a value between whole num-
                               bers,  also  provide  a  value  for the setting
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune. For example,  if  you
                               want  your  QVBR  quality level to be 7.33, set
                               qvbrQualityLevel  to  7   and   set   qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional.  Specify a value here to set the QVBR
                               quality to a level that is between  whole  num-
                               bers.  For example, if you want your QVBR qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert rounds your QVBR quality level  to  the
                               nearest  third  of a whole number. For example,
                               if you set qvbrQualityLevel to 7  and  you  set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to  .25,  your actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting to specify  whether  this  output
                            has  a  variable  bitrate  (VBR), constant bitrate
                            (CBR) or quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                        RepeatPps -> (string)
                            Places a PPS header on each encoded picture,  even
                            if repeated.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive frame from the input  corresponds  to  an
                            interlaced  field  in the output. Keep the default
                            value, Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                            other  output frame rates. With basic interlacing,
                            MediaConvert performs any  frame  rate  conversion
                            first  and  then  interlaces  the frames. When you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put  frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for
                            optimized interlacing, MediaConvert  automatically
                            falls  back  to  basic  interlacing. Required set-
                            tings: To use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode) to a value other than  Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting  to insert I-frames at scene
                            changes that the  service  automatically  detects.
                            This  improves video quality and is enabled by de-
                            fault. If this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                            detection (TRANSITION_DETECTION) for further video
                            quality improvement. For  more  information  about
                            QVBR,                                          see

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for  pro-
                            gressive  pictures, and less than or equal to half
                            the number of macroblock rows for interlaced  pic-
                            tures.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate  to  25. In your JSON job specification,
                            set (framerateControl)  to  (SPECIFIED),  (framer-
                            ateNumerator)  to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                            1.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with
                            a specification that requires a specific value. If
                            you don't have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                            recommend  that  you  adjust  the softness of your
                            output by using a  lower  value  for  the  setting
                            Sharpness  (sharpness)  or by enabling a noise re-
                            ducer filter  (noiseReducerFilter).  The  Softness
                            (softness)  setting specifies the quantization ma-
                            trices that the encoder  uses.  Keep  the  default
                            value,  0, for flat quantization. Choose the value
                            1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantiza-
                            tion   matricies  from  the  H.264  specification.
                            Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                            polation.  Increasing values from 17 to 128 result
                            in increasing reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                            The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only  use this setting when you change the default
                            value, Auto (AUTO), for the setting  H264Adaptive-
                            Quantization.  When you keep all defaults, exclud-
                            ing H264AdaptiveQuantization and all  other  adap-
                            tive  quantization  from  your JSON job specifica-
                            tion, MediaConvert automatically applies the  best
                            types of quantization for your video content. When
                            you set H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value  other
                            than  AUTO, the default value for H264SpatialAdap-
                            tiveQuantization is Enabled (ENABLED).  Keep  this
                            default  value  to adjust quantization within each
                            frame based on spatial variation of  content  com-
                            plexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder
                            uses fewer bits on areas  that  can  sustain  more
                            distortion  with  no noticeable visual degradation
                            and uses more bits on areas where any  small  dis-
                            tortion  will  be noticeable. For example, complex
                            textured blocks are encoded with  fewer  bits  and
                            smooth textured blocks are encoded with more bits.
                            Enabling this feature will almost  always  improve
                            your  video  quality. Note, though, that this fea-
                            ture doesn't take into account where the  viewer's
                            attention  is  likely to be. If viewers are likely
                            to be focusing their attention on a  part  of  the
                            screen  with  a  lot of complex texture, you might
                            choose to set  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization  to
                            Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you en-
                            able spatial adaptive quantization, set the  value
                            for  Adaptive  quantization (H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion) depending on your content.  For  homogeneous
                            content,  such as cartoons and video games, set it
                            to Low. For content with a wider variety  of  tex-
                            tures,  set  it to High or Higher. To manually en-
                            able or  disable  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization,
                            you  must set Adaptive quantization (H264Adaptive-
                            Quantization) to a value other than AUTO.

                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable  hard or soft telecine to create a smoother
                            picture. Hard telecine (HARD)  produces  a  29.97i
                            output.  Soft  telecine  (SOFT) produces an output
                            with a 23.976 output that  signals  to  the  video
                            player  device  to  do  the conversion during play
                            back.  When  you  keep  the  default  value,  None
                            (NONE),  MediaConvert  does  a standard frame rate
                            conversion to 29.97 without  doing  anything  with
                            the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Only  use this setting when you change the default
                            value, AUTO, for the setting H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion.   When  you  keep  all  defaults,  excluding
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization and  all  other  adaptive
                            quantization from your JSON job specification, Me-
                            diaConvert automatically applies the best types of
                            quantization  for your video content. When you set
                            H264AdaptiveQuantization to  a  value  other  than
                            AUTO,  the default value for H264TemporalAdaptive-
                            Quantization is Enabled (ENABLED). Keep  this  de-
                            fault  value  to  adjust  quantization within each
                            frame based on temporal variation of content  com-
                            plexity. When you enable this feature, the encoder
                            uses fewer bits on areas of the frame that  aren't
                            moving  and uses more bits on complex objects with
                            sharp edges that move a  lot.  For  example,  this
                            feature  improves  the readability of text tickers
                            on newscasts and scoreboards  on  sports  matches.
                            Enabling  this  feature will almost always improve
                            your video quality. Note, though, that  this  fea-
                            ture  doesn't take into account where the viewer's
                            attention is likely to be. If viewers  are  likely
                            to  be  focusing  their attention on a part of the
                            screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp
                            edges,  such  as sports athletes' faces, you might
                            choose to set H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization  to
                            Disabled (DISABLED). Related setting: When you en-
                            able temporal quantization, adjust the strength of
                            the  filter with the setting Adaptive quantization
                            (adaptiveQuantization). To manually enable or dis-
                            able  H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization,  you  must
                            set Adaptive  quantization  (H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion) to a value other than AUTO.

                        UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                            Inserts  timecode  for each frame as 4 bytes of an
                            unregistered SEI message.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            When you set Adaptive Quantization  (H265Adaptive-
                            Quantization)  to Auto (AUTO), or leave blank, Me-
                            diaConvert automatically applies  quantization  to
                            improve  the  video  quality  of  your output. Set
                            Adaptive  Quantization  to   Low   (LOW),   Medium
                            (MEDIUM),  High  (HIGH),  Higher  (HIGHER), or Max
                            (MAX) to manually  control  the  strength  of  the
                            quantization  filter. When you do, you can specify
                            a  value   for   Spatial   Adaptive   Quantization
                            (H265SpatialAdaptiveQuantization),  Temporal Adap-
                            tive  Quantization  (H265TemporalAdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion),    and    Flicker   Adaptive   Quantization
                            (H265FlickerAdaptiveQuantization), to further con-
                            trol the quantization filter. Set Adaptive Quanti-
                            zation to Off (OFF) to apply  no  quantization  to
                            your output.

                        AlternateTransferFunctionSei -> (string)
                            Enables  Alternate  Transfer  Function SEI message
                            for outputs using Hybrid  Log  Gamma  (HLG)  Elec-
                            tro-Optical Transfer Function (EOTF).

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  average  bitrate in bits per second.
                            Required for VBR and CBR. For MS  Smooth  outputs,
                            bitrates  must  be unique when rounded down to the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            H.265 Level.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Represents the Profile  and  Tier,  per  the  HEVC
                            (H.265)  specification.  Selections are grouped as
                            [Profile] / [Tier], so "Main/High" represents Main
                            Profile  with  High  Tier. 4:2:2 profiles are only
                            available with the HEVC 4:2:2 License.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow the number of B-frames in
                            your output GOP structure to vary or not depending
                            on your input video content. To improve  the  sub-
                            jective  video  quality  of  your  output that has
                            high-motion content: Leave blank or keep  the  de-
                            fault  value Adaptive. MediaConvert will use fewer
                            B-frames  for  high-motion  video   content   than
                            low-motion  content.  The  maximum  number  of  B-
                            frames is limited by the value that you choose for
                            B-frames between reference frames. To use the same
                            number B-frames for all types of  content:  Choose
                            Static.

                        FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting  to  have the encoder reduce
                            I-frame pop.  I-frame  pop  appears  as  a  visual
                            flicker that can arise when the encoder saves bits
                            by copying some macroblocks many times from  frame
                            to  frame, and then refreshes them at the I-frame.
                            When you enable this setting, the encoder  updates
                            these  macroblocks  slightly  more often to smooth
                            out the flicker. This setting is disabled  by  de-
                            fault.  Related  setting:  In addition to enabling
                            this setting, you must also set  adaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion to a value other than Off (OFF).

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your transcoding job specification as a JSON  file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify which value the service  uses  for  the  frame
                            rate    for    this    output.   Choose   INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in  the settings FramerateNumerator and Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopBReference -> (string)
                            Specify whether to allow B-frames to be referenced
                            by other frame types. To  use  reference  B-frames
                            when  your  GOP  structure has 1 or more B-frames:
                            Leave blank or keep the default value Enabled.  We
                            recommend  that you choose Enabled to help improve
                            the video quality of your output relative  to  its
                            bitrate.  To  not  use  reference B-frames: Choose
                            Disabled.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify the relative frequency of open  to  closed
                            GOPs  in  this output. For example, if you want to
                            allow four open GOPs and  then  require  a  closed
                            GOP,  set  this  value to 5. We recommend that you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put video. To enable this automatic behavior, keep
                            the  default  value by leaving this setting out of
                            your JSON job specification. In  the  console,  do
                            this by keeping the default empty value. If you do
                            explicitly specify a value, for segmented outputs,
                            don't set this value to 0.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Use  this  setting only when you set GOP mode con-
                            trol (GopSizeUnits) to Specified, frames  (FRAMES)
                            or  Specified,  seconds (SECONDS). Specify the GOP
                            length using a whole number of frames or a decimal
                            value of seconds. MediaConvert will interpret this
                            value as frames or seconds depending on the  value
                            you choose for GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If
                            you want to allow  MediaConvert  to  automatically
                            determine  GOP  size, leave GOP size blank and set
                            GOP mode control to Auto (AUTO).  If  your  output
                            group specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF, leave GOP size
                            blank and set GOP mode control  to  Auto  in  each
                            output in your output group.

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify how the transcoder determines GOP size for
                            this  output.  We  recommend  that  you  have  the
                            transcoder automatically choose this value for you
                            based on characteristics of your input  video.  To
                            enable this automatic behavior, choose Auto (AUTO)
                            and and leave GOP size  (GopSize)  blank.  By  de-
                            fault, if you don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                            SizeUnits), MediaConvert will use automatic behav-
                            ior.  If your output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                            CMAF, set GOP mode control to Auto and  leave  GOP
                            size blank in each output in your output group. To
                            explicitly specify the GOP length,  choose  Speci-
                            fied,  frames (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SEC-
                            ONDS) and then provide the GOP length in  the  re-
                            lated setting GOP size (GopSize).

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If  your downstream systems have strict buffer re-
                            quirements: Specify the minimum percentage of  the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded video segment. For the best  video  quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage of the buffer that should initially  be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to create
                            a progressive output, regardless of the scan  type
                            of  your input. Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or
                            Bottom field first  (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to  create  an
                            output  that's  interlaced with the same field po-
                            larity throughout. Use Follow, default  top  (FOL-
                            LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default  bottom (FOL-
                            LOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same
                            field  polarity  as the source. For jobs that have
                            multiple inputs, the output field  polarity  might
                            change  over  the course of the output. Follow be-
                            havior depends on the  input  scan  type.  If  the
                            source  is  interlaced,  the output will be inter-
                            laced with the same polarity as the source. If the
                            source  is  progressive, the output will be inter-
                            laced with top field bottom field first, depending
                            on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000. Required when
                            Rate control mode is QVBR.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use  this  setting only when you also enable Scene
                            change detection (SceneChangeDetect). This setting
                            determines how the encoder manages the spacing be-
                            tween I-frames that it  inserts  as  part  of  the
                            I-frame  cadence  and the I-frames that it inserts
                            for Scene change detection. We recommend that  you
                            have  the  transcoder  automatically  choose  this
                            value for you based on characteristics of your in-
                            put video. To enable this automatic behavior, keep
                            the default value by leaving this setting  out  of
                            your  JSON  job  specification. In the console, do
                            this by keeping the default empty value. When  you
                            explicitly  specify  a value for this setting, the
                            encoder  determines  whether   to   skip   a   ca-
                            dence-driven I-frame by the value you set. For ex-
                            ample, if you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to
                            5 and a cadence-driven I-frame would fall within 5
                            frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the encoder
                            skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this way, one
                            GOP is shrunk slightly and one  GOP  is  stretched
                            slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven  I-frames are
                            farther from the  scene-change  I-frame  than  the
                            value   you  set,  then  the  encoder  leaves  all
                            I-frames in place and  the  GOPs  surrounding  the
                            scene  change  are  smaller than the usual cadence
                            GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of B-frames  between  reference
                            frames in this output. For the best video quality:
                            Leave blank. MediaConvert automatically determines
                            the number of B-frames to use based on the charac-
                            teristics of your input video. To manually specify
                            the  number  of B-frames between reference frames:
                            Enter an integer from 0 to 7.

                        NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Number of reference frames to use. The encoder may
                            use  more  than requested if using B-frames and/or
                            interlaced encoding.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault   behavior,    Follow    source    (INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses  the  PAR  from your input
                            video for your output. To specify a different  PAR
                            in the console, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. To specify a different PAR by editing  the
                            JSON job specification, choose SPECIFIED. When you
                            choose SPECIFIED for this setting, you  must  also
                            specify values for the parNumerator and parDenomi-
                            nator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level  (qualityTun-
                            ingLevel)  to choose how you want to trade off en-
                            coding speed for output video quality. The default
                            behavior is faster, lower quality, single-pass en-
                            coding.

                        QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings for quality-defined variable bitrate  en-
                            coding  with  the  H.265 codec. Use these settings
                            only when you  set  QVBR  for  Rate  control  mode
                            (RateControlMode).

                            MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when Rate control mode is
                               QVBR and Quality tuning level is Multi-pass HQ.
                               For  Max  average  bitrate values suited to the
                               complexity of your  input  video,  the  service
                               limits the average bitrate of the video part of
                               this output to the value that you choose.  That
                               is, the total size of the video element is less
                               than or equal to the value you  set  multiplied
                               by the number of seconds of encoded output.

                            QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                               Use this setting only when you set Rate control
                               mode (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.  Specify  the
                               target quality level for this output. MediaCon-
                               vert determines the right number of bits to use
                               for  each  part  of  the  video to maintain the
                               video quality that you specify. When  you  keep
                               the  default  value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks a
                               quality level for you, based on characteristics
                               of your input video. If you prefer to specify a
                               quality level, specify a number from 1  through
                               10.  Use  higher  numbers  for greater quality.
                               Level 10 results in  nearly  lossless  compres-
                               sion.   The   quality  level  for  most  broad-
                               cast-quality transcodes is between 6 and 9. Op-
                               tionally, to specify a value between whole num-
                               bers, also provide  a  value  for  the  setting
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune.  For  example, if you
                               want your QVBR quality level to  be  7.33,  set
                               qvbrQualityLevel   to   7   and  set  qvbrQual-
                               ityLevelFineTune to .33.

                            QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                               Optional. Specify a value here to set the  QVBR
                               quality  to  a level that is between whole num-
                               bers. For example, if you want your QVBR  qual-
                               ity level to be 7.33, set qvbrQualityLevel to 7
                               and set qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to .33. Media-
                               Convert  rounds  your QVBR quality level to the
                               nearest third of a whole number.  For  example,
                               if  you  set  qvbrQualityLevel to 7 and you set
                               qvbrQualityLevelFineTune to  .25,  your  actual
                               QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  to specify whether this output
                            has a variable  bitrate  (VBR),  constant  bitrate
                            (CBR) or quality-defined variable bitrate (QVBR).

                        SampleAdaptiveOffsetFilterMode -> (string)
                            Specify   Sample   Adaptive  Offset  (SAO)  filter
                            strength. Adaptive mode dynamically  selects  best
                            strength based on content

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive frame from the input  corresponds  to  an
                            interlaced  field  in the output. Keep the default
                            value, Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                            other  output frame rates. With basic interlacing,
                            MediaConvert performs any  frame  rate  conversion
                            first  and  then  interlaces  the frames. When you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put  frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for
                            optimized interlacing, MediaConvert  automatically
                            falls  back  to  basic  interlacing. Required set-
                            tings: To use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode) to a value other than  Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable  this  setting  to insert I-frames at scene
                            changes that the  service  automatically  detects.
                            This  improves video quality and is enabled by de-
                            fault. If this output uses QVBR, choose Transition
                            detection (TRANSITION_DETECTION) for further video
                            quality improvement. For  more  information  about
                            QVBR,                                          see

                        Slices -> (integer)
                            Number of slices per picture. Must be less than or
                            equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for  pro-
                            gressive  pictures, and less than or equal to half
                            the number of macroblock rows for interlaced  pic-
                            tures.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate  to  25. In your JSON job specification,
                            set (framerateControl)  to  (SPECIFIED),  (framer-
                            ateNumerator)  to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                            1.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to  ad-
                            just  quantization within each frame based on spa-
                            tial variation of content complexity. When you en-
                            able  this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits on
                            areas that can sustain more distortion with no no-
                            ticeable  visual degradation and uses more bits on
                            areas where any small distortion will  be  notice-
                            able. For example, complex textured blocks are en-
                            coded with fewer bits and smooth  textured  blocks
                            are  encoded with more bits. Enabling this feature
                            will almost always  improve  your  video  quality.
                            Note,  though, that this feature doesn't take into
                            account where the viewer's attention is likely  to
                            be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                            tention on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                            plex  texture,  you  might  choose to disable this
                            feature. Related setting: When you enable  spatial
                            adaptive  quantization, set the value for Adaptive
                            quantization (adaptiveQuantization)  depending  on
                            your  content.  For  homogeneous  content, such as
                            cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For  con-
                            tent  with  a wider variety of textures, set it to
                            High or Higher.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            This field applies only if the Streams >  Advanced
                            >  Framerate  (framerate)  field is set to 29.970.

                            Mode  field  (interlace_mode) to identify the scan
                            type for the output: Progressive, Interlaced, Hard
                            Telecine or Soft Telecine. - Hard: produces 29.97i
                            output from 23.976 input. - Soft: produces 23.976;
                            the player converts this output to 29.97i.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep  the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to ad-
                            just quantization within each frame based on  tem-
                            poral  variation  of  content complexity. When you
                            enable this feature, the encoder uses  fewer  bits
                            on  areas of the frame that aren't moving and uses
                            more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that
                            move a lot. For example, this feature improves the
                            readability  of  text  tickers  on  newscasts  and
                            scoreboards  on sports matches. Enabling this fea-
                            ture will almost always improve your  video  qual-
                            ity.  Note, though, that this feature doesn't take
                            into  account  where  the  viewer's  attention  is
                            likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing
                            their attention on  a  part  of  the  screen  that
                            doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such
                            as sports athletes' faces,  you  might  choose  to
                            disable  this  feature.  Related setting: When you
                            enable temporal quantization, adjust the  strength
                            of  the filter with the setting Adaptive quantiza-
                            tion (adaptiveQuantization).

                        TemporalIds -> (string)
                            Enables temporal layer identifiers in the  encoded
                            bitstream.  Up to 3 layers are supported depending
                            on GOP structure: I- and P-frames form one  layer,
                            reference  B-frames  can  form  a second layer and
                            non-reference b-frames can form a third layer. De-
                            coders can optionally decode only the lower tempo-
                            ral layers to generate a lower frame rate  output.
                            For  example,  given a bitstream with temporal IDs
                            and with b-frames = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display order),
                            a  decoder  could  decode  all the frames for full
                            frame rate output or only the I and P frames (low-
                            est temporal layer) for a half frame rate output.

                        Tiles -> (string)
                            Enable  use  of tiles, allowing horizontal as well
                            as vertical subdivision of the encoded pictures.

                        UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                            Inserts timecode for each frame as 4 bytes  of  an
                            unregistered SEI message.

                        WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                            If the location of parameter set NAL units doesn't
                            matter in your workflow, ignore this setting.  Use
                            this  setting  only  with CMAF or DASH outputs, or
                            with standalone file outputs  in  an  MPEG-4  con-
                            tainer  (MP4  outputs).  Choose  HVC1 to mark your
                            output as HVC1. This makes your  output  compliant
                            with the following specification: ISO IECJTC1 SC29
                            N13798 Text ISO/IEC FDIS 14496-15 3rd Edition. For
                            these  outputs,  the  service stores parameter set
                            NAL units in the sample headers  but  not  in  the
                            samples directly. For MP4 outputs, when you choose
                            HVC1, your output video might  not  work  properly
                            with  some  downstream  systems and video players.
                            The service defaults to  marking  your  output  as
                            HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes param-
                            eter set NAL units directly into the samples.

                     Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                        Required when you  set  (Codec)  under  (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value MPEG2.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Specify  the strength of any adaptive quantization
                            filters that you enable. The value that you choose
                            here  applies  to  the following settings: Spatial
                            adaptive  quantization   (spatialAdaptiveQuantiza-
                            tion),  and Temporal adaptive quantization (tempo-
                            ralAdaptiveQuantization).

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify the average bitrate in  bits  per  second.
                            Required  for  VBR and CBR. For MS Smooth outputs,
                            bitrates must be unique when rounded down  to  the
                            nearest multiple of 1000.

                        CodecLevel -> (string)
                            Use  Level  (Mpeg2CodecLevel)  to  set  the MPEG-2
                            level for the video output.

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Use Profile (Mpeg2CodecProfile) to set the  MPEG-2
                            profile for the video output.

                        DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                            Choose  Adaptive to improve subjective video qual-
                            ity for high-motion content. This will  cause  the
                            service  to use fewer B-frames (which infer infor-
                            mation based on other frames) for high-motion por-
                            tions  of  the video and more B-frames for low-mo-
                            tion portions. The maximum number of  B-frames  is
                            limited by the value you provide for the setting B
                            frames between reference frames  (numberBFramesBe-
                            tweenReferenceFrames).

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your transcoding job specification as a JSON  file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify which value the service  uses  for  the  frame
                            rate    for    this    output.   Choose   INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in  the settings FramerateNumerator and Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  relative frequency of open to closed
                            GOPs in this output. For example, if you  want  to
                            allow  four  open  GOPs  and then require a closed
                            GOP, set this  value  to  5.  When  you  create  a
                            streaming  output,  we recommend that you keep the
                            default  value,  1,  so  that   players   starting
                            mid-stream receive an IDR frame as quickly as pos-
                            sible. Don't set this value to 0; that would break
                            output segmenting.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            Specify the interval between keyframes, in seconds
                            or frames, for this output.  Default:  12  Related
                            settings:  When  you  specify the GOP size in sec-
                            onds, set GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits) to Spec-
                            ified,  seconds  (SECONDS).  The default value for
                            GOP  mode   control   (GopSizeUnits)   is   Frames
                            (FRAMES).

                        GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                            Specify  the  units for GOP size (GopSize). If you
                            don't specify a value here, by default the encoder
                            measures GOP size in frames.

                        HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            If  your downstream systems have strict buffer re-
                            quirements: Specify the minimum percentage of  the
                            HRD buffer that's available at the end of each en-
                            coded video segment. For the best  video  quality:
                            Set to 0 or leave blank to automatically determine
                            the final buffer fill percentage.

                        HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                            Percentage of the buffer that should initially  be
                            filled (HRD buffer model).

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to create
                            a progressive output, regardless of the scan  type
                            of  your input. Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or
                            Bottom field first  (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to  create  an
                            output  that's  interlaced with the same field po-
                            larity throughout. Use Follow, default  top  (FOL-
                            LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default  bottom (FOL-
                            LOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same
                            field  polarity  as the source. For jobs that have
                            multiple inputs, the output field  polarity  might
                            change  over  the course of the output. Follow be-
                            havior depends on the  input  scan  type.  If  the
                            source  is  interlaced,  the output will be inter-
                            laced with the same polarity as the source. If the
                            source  is  progressive, the output will be inter-
                            laced with top field bottom field first, depending
                            on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                            Use  Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraDcPrecision) to
                            set quantization precision for intra-block DC  co-
                            efficients. If you choose the value auto, the ser-
                            vice will automatically select the precision based
                            on the per-frame compression ratio.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Maximum bitrate in bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        MinIInterval -> (integer)
                            Use this setting only when you also  enable  Scene
                            change detection (SceneChangeDetect). This setting
                            determines how the encoder manages the spacing be-
                            tween  I-frames  that  it  inserts  as part of the
                            I-frame cadence and the I-frames that  it  inserts
                            for  Scene  change  detection.  When you specify a
                            value for this  setting,  the  encoder  determines
                            whether  to  skip  a cadence-driven I-frame by the
                            value you set. For example, if you set Min  I  in-
                            terval  (minIInterval)  to  5 and a cadence-driven
                            I-frame  would  fall  within   5   frames   of   a
                            scene-change  I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                            cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,  one  GOP  is
                            shrunk slightly and one GOP is stretched slightly.
                            When the cadence-driven I-frames are farther  from
                            the  scene-change  I-frame than the value you set,
                            then the encoder leaves all I-frames in place  and
                            the  GOPs surrounding the scene change are smaller
                            than the usual cadence GOPs.

                        NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                            Specify the number of B-frames  that  MediaConvert
                            puts  between  reference  frames  in  this output.
                            Valid values are whole numbers from 0  through  7.
                            When  you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert de-
                            faults to 2.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault   behavior,    Follow    source    (INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses  the  PAR  from your input
                            video for your output. To specify a different  PAR
                            in the console, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. To specify a different PAR by editing  the
                            JSON job specification, choose SPECIFIED. When you
                            choose SPECIFIED for this setting, you  must  also
                            specify values for the parNumerator and parDenomi-
                            nator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level  (qualityTun-
                            ingLevel)  to choose how you want to trade off en-
                            coding speed for output video quality. The default
                            behavior is faster, lower quality, single-pass en-
                            coding.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            Use Rate control  mode  (Mpeg2RateControlMode)  to
                            specify  whether  the bitrate is variable (vbr) or
                            constant (cbr).

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to  create a better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive  frame  from  the input corresponds to an
                            interlaced field in the output. Keep  the  default
                            value,  Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for all
                            other output frame rates. With basic  interlacing,
                            MediaConvert  performs  any  frame rate conversion
                            first and then interlaces  the  frames.  When  you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put frame rate to a value that isn't suitable  for
                            optimized  interlacing, MediaConvert automatically
                            falls back to  basic  interlacing.  Required  set-
                            tings:  To use optimized interlacing, you must set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode)  to a value other than Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                            Enable this setting to insert  I-frames  at  scene
                            changes  that  the  service automatically detects.
                            This improves video quality and is enabled by  de-
                            fault.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate  to  25. In your JSON job specification,
                            set (framerateControl)  to  (SPECIFIED),  (framer-
                            ateNumerator)  to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                            1.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore this setting unless you need to comply with
                            a specification that requires a specific value. If
                            you don't have  a  specification  requirement,  we
                            recommend  that  you  adjust  the softness of your
                            output by using a  lower  value  for  the  setting
                            Sharpness  (sharpness)  or by enabling a noise re-
                            ducer filter  (noiseReducerFilter).  The  Softness
                            (softness)  setting specifies the quantization ma-
                            trices that the encoder  uses.  Keep  the  default
                            value,  0, to use the AWS Elemental default matri-
                            ces. Choose a value from 17 to 128 to  use  planar
                            interpolation.  Increasing  values  from 17 to 128
                            result in increasing reduction  of  high-frequency
                            data. The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep  the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to ad-
                            just quantization within each frame based on  spa-
                            tial variation of content complexity. When you en-
                            able this feature, the encoder uses fewer bits  on
                            areas that can sustain more distortion with no no-
                            ticeable visual degradation and uses more bits  on
                            areas  where  any small distortion will be notice-
                            able. For example, complex textured blocks are en-
                            coded  with  fewer bits and smooth textured blocks
                            are encoded with more bits. Enabling this  feature
                            will  almost  always  improve  your video quality.
                            Note, though, that this feature doesn't take  into
                            account  where the viewer's attention is likely to
                            be. If viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                            tention on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                            plex texture, you might  choose  to  disable  this
                            feature.  Related setting: When you enable spatial
                            adaptive quantization, set the value for  Adaptive
                            quantization  (adaptiveQuantization)  depending on
                            your content. For  homogeneous  content,  such  as
                            cartoons  and video games, set it to Low. For con-
                            tent with a wider variety of textures, set  it  to
                            High or Higher.

                        Syntax -> (string)
                            Specify  whether  this output's video uses the D10
                            syntax. Keep the default value to not use the syn-
                            tax.  Related settings: When you choose D10 (D_10)
                            for your MXF profile (profile), you must also  set
                            this value to D10 (D_10).

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When  you  do  frame  rate  conversion from 23.976
                            frames per second (fps) to  29.97  fps,  and  your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable hard or soft telecine to create a  smoother
                            picture.  Hard  telecine  (HARD) produces a 29.97i
                            output. Soft telecine (SOFT)  produces  an  output
                            with  a  23.976  output  that signals to the video
                            player device to do  the  conversion  during  play
                            back.  When  you  keep  the  default  value,  None
                            (NONE), MediaConvert does a  standard  frame  rate
                            conversion  to  29.97  without doing anything with
                            the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to  ad-
                            just  quantization within each frame based on tem-
                            poral variation of content  complexity.  When  you
                            enable  this  feature, the encoder uses fewer bits
                            on areas of the frame that aren't moving and  uses
                            more bits on complex objects with sharp edges that
                            move a lot. For example, this feature improves the
                            readability  of  text  tickers  on  newscasts  and
                            scoreboards on sports matches. Enabling this  fea-
                            ture  will  almost always improve your video qual-
                            ity. Note, though, that this feature doesn't  take
                            into  account  where  the  viewer's  attention  is
                            likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing
                            their  attention  on  a  part  of  the screen that
                            doesn't have moving objects with sharp edges, such
                            as  sports  athletes'  faces,  you might choose to
                            disable this feature. Related  setting:  When  you
                            enable  temporal quantization, adjust the strength
                            of the filter with the setting Adaptive  quantiza-
                            tion (adaptiveQuantization).

                     ProresSettings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value PRORES.

                        ChromaSampling -> (string)
                            This setting  applies  only  to  ProRes  4444  and
                            ProRes 4444 XQ outputs that you create from inputs
                            that use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Preserve 4:4:4
                            sampling  (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING) to allow outputs
                            to also use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. You must  spec-
                            ify  a  value  for  this  setting when your output
                            codec profile supports 4:4:4 chroma sampling.  Re-
                            lated  Settings:  When  you set Chroma sampling to
                            Preserve 4:4:4  sampling  (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING),
                            you  must choose an output codec profile that sup-
                            ports 4:4:4 chroma sampling. These values for Pro-
                            file (CodecProfile) support 4:4:4 chroma sampling:
                            Apple ProRes  4444  (APPLE_PRORES_4444)  or  Apple
                            ProRes  4444  XQ  (APPLE_PRORES_4444_XQ). When you
                            set Chroma sampling to  Preserve  4:4:4  sampling,
                            you  must  disable  all video preprocessors except
                            for Nexguard  file  marker  (PartnerWatermarking).
                            When  you  set  Chroma  sampling to Preserve 4:4:4
                            sampling and use framerate  conversion,  you  must
                            set Frame rate conversion algorithm (FramerateCon-
                            versionAlgorithm)  to   Drop   duplicate   (DUPLI-
                            CATE_DROP).

                        CodecProfile -> (string)
                            Use  Profile  (ProResCodecProfile)  to specify the
                            type of Apple ProRes codec to use for this output.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console,  use  the  Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown in the dropdown list are decimal  approxima-
                            tions  of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your  transcoding job specification as a JSON file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify  which  value  the  service uses for the frame
                            rate   for   this    output.    Choose    INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in the settings FramerateNumerator and  Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Choose the scan line type for the output. Keep the
                            default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to create
                            a progressive output, regardless of the scan  type
                            of  your input. Use Top field first (TOP_FIELD) or
                            Bottom field first  (BOTTOM_FIELD)  to  create  an
                            output  that's  interlaced with the same field po-
                            larity throughout. Use Follow, default  top  (FOL-
                            LOW_TOP_FIELD)  or  Follow,  default  bottom (FOL-
                            LOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to produce outputs with the same
                            field  polarity  as the source. For jobs that have
                            multiple inputs, the output field  polarity  might
                            change  over  the course of the output. Follow be-
                            havior depends on the  input  scan  type.  If  the
                            source  is  interlaced,  the output will be inter-
                            laced with the same polarity as the source. If the
                            source  is  progressive, the output will be inter-
                            laced with top field bottom field first, depending
                            on which of the Follow options you choose.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional.  Specify  how the service determines the
                            pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The  de-
                            fault    behavior,    Follow    source   (INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the  PAR  from  your  input
                            video  for your output. To specify a different PAR
                            in the console, choose any value other than Follow
                            source.  To specify a different PAR by editing the
                            JSON job specification, choose SPECIFIED. When you
                            choose  SPECIFIED  for this setting, you must also
                            specify values for the parNumerator and parDenomi-
                            nator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (parCon-
                            trol) to SPECIFIED. On the  console,  this  corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you specify an output  pixel  aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                            that  is different from your input video PAR, pro-
                            vide your output PAR as a ratio. For example,  for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (parCon-
                            trol) to SPECIFIED. On the  console,  this  corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you specify an output  pixel  aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                            that  is different from your input video PAR, pro-
                            vide your output PAR as a ratio. For example,  for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output frame rate is  half  of  your  input  frame
                            rate.  In  this situation, choose Optimized inter-
                            lacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a  better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive frame from the input  corresponds  to  an
                            interlaced  field  in the output. Keep the default
                            value, Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for  all
                            other  output frame rates. With basic interlacing,
                            MediaConvert performs any  frame  rate  conversion
                            first  and  then  interlaces  the frames. When you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put  frame rate to a value that isn't suitable for
                            optimized interlacing, MediaConvert  automatically
                            falls  back  to  basic  interlacing. Required set-
                            tings: To use optimized interlacing, you must  set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode) to a value other than  Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your input frame rate
                            is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).  Enable
                            slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When you en-
                            able slow PAL,  MediaConvert  relabels  the  video
                            frames  to 25 fps and resamples your audio to keep
                            it synchronized with the video. Note that enabling
                            this  setting will slightly reduce the duration of
                            your video. Required settings: You must  also  set
                            Framerate  to  25. In your JSON job specification,
                            set (framerateControl)  to  (SPECIFIED),  (framer-
                            ateNumerator)  to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to
                            1.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When you do  frame  rate  conversion  from  23.976
                            frames  per  second  (fps)  to 29.97 fps, and your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable  hard  telecine (HARD) to create a smoother
                            picture. When you keep  the  default  value,  None
                            (NONE),  MediaConvert  does  a standard frame rate
                            conversion to 29.97 without  doing  anything  with
                            the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                     Vc3Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VC3

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If you are using the console,  use  the  Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame rate conversion, choose a  frame  rate  from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown in the dropdown list are decimal  approxima-
                            tions  of fractions. If you choose Custom, specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your  transcoding job specification as a JSON file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify  which  value  the  service uses for the frame
                            rate   for   this    output.    Choose    INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in the settings FramerateNumerator and  Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose  the  method  that you want MediaConvert to
                            use when increasing or decreasing the frame  rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to 30 fps: We recommend that you keep the  default
                            value,  Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame  rate conversions, especially if your source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence:  Choose  FrameFormer to do motion-compen-
                            sated interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the  best
                            conversion  method frame by frame. Note that using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs  a  significant  add-on cost. When you choose
                            FrameFormer, your input video resolution  must  be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateDenominator to specify the  denomina-
                            tor  of  this  fraction. In this example, use 1001
                            for the value of  FramerateDenominator.  When  you
                            use  the console for transcode jobs that use frame
                            rate conversion, provide the value  as  a  decimal
                            number  for  Framerate.  In  this example, specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this fraction. In this example, use 24000 for  the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole for transcode jobs that use frame  rate  con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        InterlaceMode -> (string)
                            Optional. Choose the scan line type for this  out-
                            put.  If  you  don't specify a value, MediaConvert
                            will create a progressive output.

                        ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                            Use this setting for interlaced outputs, when your
                            output  frame  rate  is  half  of your input frame
                            rate. In this situation, choose  Optimized  inter-
                            lacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to  create a better
                            quality interlaced output. In this case, each pro-
                            gressive  frame  from  the input corresponds to an
                            interlaced field in the output. Keep  the  default
                            value,  Basic  interlacing  (INTERLACED),  for all
                            other output frame rates. With basic  interlacing,
                            MediaConvert  performs  any  frame rate conversion
                            first and then interlaces  the  frames.  When  you
                            choose Optimized interlacing and you set your out-
                            put frame rate to a value that isn't suitable  for
                            optimized  interlacing, MediaConvert automatically
                            falls back to  basic  interlacing.  Required  set-
                            tings:  To use optimized interlacing, you must set
                            Telecine (telecine) to None (NONE) or Soft (SOFT).
                            You  can't  use  optimized  interlacing  for  hard
                            telecine outputs. You must also set Interlace mode
                            (interlaceMode)  to a value other than Progressive
                            (PROGRESSIVE).

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate
                            is  23.976  or  24 frames per second (fps). Enable
                            slow PAL to create a 25 fps output  by  relabeling
                            the  video  frames and resampling your audio. Note
                            that enabling this setting  will  slightly  reduce
                            the  duration of your video. Related settings: You
                            must also set Framerate to 25. In  your  JSON  job
                            specification,  set  (framerateControl) to (SPECI-
                            FIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and  (framerate-
                            Denominator) to 1.

                        Telecine -> (string)
                            When  you  do  frame  rate  conversion from 23.976
                            frames per second (fps) to  29.97  fps,  and  your
                            output scan type is interlaced, you can optionally
                            enable hard telecine (HARD) to create  a  smoother
                            picture.  When  you  keep  the default value, None
                            (NONE), MediaConvert does a  standard  frame  rate
                            conversion  to  29.97  without doing anything with
                            the field polarity to create a smoother picture.

                        Vc3Class -> (string)
                            Specify the VC3 class to choose the quality  char-
                            acteristics  for  this output. VC3 class, together
                            with the  settings  Framerate  (framerateNumerator
                            and  framerateDenominator)  and Resolution (height
                            and width), determine your output bitrate. For ex-
                            ample, say that your video resolution is 1920x1080
                            and  your  framerate  is  29.97.  Then  Class  145
                            (CLASS_145)  gives you an output with a bitrate of
                            approximately 145 Mbps and Class  220  (CLASS_220)
                            gives  you  and  output with a bitrate of approxi-
                            mately 220 Mbps.  VC3  class  also  specifies  the
                            color bit depth of your output.

                     Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VP8.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Target bitrate in bits/second. For example,  enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your transcoding job specification as a JSON  file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify which value the service  uses  for  the  frame
                            rate    for    this    output.   Choose   INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in  the settings FramerateNumerator and Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must be
                            greater than zero.

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Optional. Size of buffer  (HRD  buffer  model)  in
                            bits. For example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this  setting  unless  you set qualityTun-
                            ingLevel to MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the max-
                            imum  bitrate  in  bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.  The  default
                            behavior uses twice the target bitrate as the max-
                            imum bitrate.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output. The de-
                            fault   behavior,    Follow    source    (INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses  the  PAR  from your input
                            video for your output. To specify a different  PAR
                            in the console, choose any value other than Follow
                            source. To specify a different PAR by editing  the
                            JSON job specification, choose SPECIFIED. When you
                            choose SPECIFIED for this setting, you  must  also
                            specify values for the parNumerator and parDenomi-
                            nator settings.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (parCon-
                            trol)  to  SPECIFIED.  On the console, this corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you  specify  an  output  pixel aspect ratio (PAR)
                            that is different from your input video PAR,  pro-
                            vide  your output PAR as a ratio. For example, for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level  (qualityTun-
                            ingLevel)  to choose how you want to trade off en-
                            coding speed for output video quality. The default
                            behavior  is faster, lower quality, multi-pass en-
                            coding.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            With the VP8 codec, you can use only the  variable
                            bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                     Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                        Required  when  you  set  (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VP9.

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Target bitrate in bits/second. For example,  enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are  using the console, use the Framerate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list or choose Custom. The framerates
                            shown  in the dropdown list are decimal approxima-
                            tions of fractions. If you choose Custom,  specify
                            your frame rate as a fraction. If you are creating
                            your transcoding job specification as a JSON  file
                            without the console, use FramerateControl to spec-
                            ify which value the service  uses  for  the  frame
                            rate    for    this    output.   Choose   INITIAL-
                            IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to use the
                            frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED if you
                            want the service to use the frame rate you specify
                            in  the settings FramerateNumerator and Framerate-
                            Denominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Framerate.  In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        GopSize -> (double)
                            GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must be
                            greater than zero.

                        HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                            Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For ex-
                            ample, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                        MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this  setting  unless  you set qualityTun-
                            ingLevel to MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the max-
                            imum  bitrate  in  bits/second. For example, enter
                            five megabits per second as 5000000.  The  default
                            behavior uses twice the target bitrate as the max-
                            imum bitrate.

                        ParControl -> (string)
                            Optional. Specify how the service  determines  the
                            pixel  aspect  ratio  for this output. The default
                            behavior is to use the same pixel aspect ratio  as
                            your input video.

                        ParDenominator -> (integer)
                            Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (parCon-
                            trol) to SPECIFIED. On the  console,  this  corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you specify an output  pixel  aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                            that  is different from your input video PAR, pro-
                            vide your output PAR as a ratio. For example,  for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parDenomina-
                            tor is 33.

                        ParNumerator -> (integer)
                            Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (parCon-
                            trol) to SPECIFIED. On the  console,  this  corre-
                            sponds to any value other than Follow source. When
                            you specify an output  pixel  aspect  ratio  (PAR)
                            that  is different from your input video PAR, pro-
                            vide your output PAR as a ratio. For example,  for
                            D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would specify the ratio
                            40:33. In this example, the value for parNumerator
                            is 40.

                        QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                            Optional.  Use  Quality  tuning level (qualityTun-
                            ingLevel) to choose how you want to trade off  en-
                            coding speed for output video quality. The default
                            behavior is faster, lower quality, multi-pass  en-
                            coding.

                        RateControlMode -> (string)
                            With  the VP9 codec, you can use only the variable
                            bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                     XavcSettings -> (structure)
                        Required when you  set  (Codec)  under  (VideoDescrip-
                        tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value XAVC.

                        AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            Keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for this set-
                            ting to have MediaConvert automatically apply  the
                            best types of quantization for your video content.
                            When you want to apply your quantization  settings
                            manually,   you  must  set  Adaptive  quantization
                            (adaptiveQuantization) to a value other than  Auto
                            (AUTO).  Use  this setting to specify the strength
                            of any adaptive quantization filters that you  en-
                            able.  If  you  don't  want MediaConvert to do any
                            adaptive quantization in this transcode, set Adap-
                            tive  quantization to Off (OFF). Related settings:
                            The value that you choose here applies to the fol-

                            (flickerAdaptiveQuantization),  Spatial   adaptive
                            quantization   (spatialAdaptiveQuantization),  and
                            Temporal adaptive quantization  (temporalAdaptive-
                            Quantization).

                        EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                            Optional.  Choose a specific entropy encoding mode
                            only when you want to  override  XAVC  recommenda-
                            tions.  If you choose the value auto, MediaConvert
                            uses the mode that the XAVC file format  specifies
                            given this output's operating point.

                        FramerateControl -> (string)
                            If  you  are using the console, use the Frame rate
                            setting to specify the frame rate for this output.
                            If you want to keep the same frame rate as the in-
                            put video, choose Follow source. If you want to do
                            frame  rate  conversion,  choose a frame rate from
                            the dropdown list. The  framerates  shown  in  the
                            dropdown  list are decimal approximations of frac-
                            tions. If you are creating  your  transcoding  job
                            specification  as a JSON file without the console,
                            use FramerateControl to specify  which  value  the
                            service  uses  for the frame rate for this output.
                            Choose INITIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the ser-
                            vice  to use the frame rate from the input. Choose
                            SPECIFIED if you want the service to use the frame
                            rate that you specify in the settings FramerateNu-
                            merator and FramerateDenominator.

                        FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                            Choose the method that you  want  MediaConvert  to
                            use  when increasing or decreasing the frame rate.
                            For numerically simple conversions, such as 60 fps
                            to  30 fps: We recommend that you keep the default
                            value, Drop  duplicate.  For  numerically  complex
                            conversions, to avoid stutter: Choose Interpolate.
                            This results in a smooth picture, but might intro-
                            duce  undesirable  video  artifacts.  For  complex
                            frame rate conversions, especially if your  source
                            video has already been converted from its original
                            cadence: Choose FrameFormer to  do  motion-compen-
                            sated  interpolation.  FrameFormer  uses  the best
                            conversion method frame by frame. Note that  using
                            FrameFormer increases the transcoding time and in-
                            curs a significant add-on cost.  When  you  choose
                            FrameFormer,  your  input video resolution must be
                            at least 128x96.

                        FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                            When you use the API for transcode jobs  that  use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976  fps.
                            Use  FramerateDenominator to specify the denomina-
                            tor of this fraction. In this  example,  use  1001
                            for  the  value  of FramerateDenominator. When you
                            use the console for transcode jobs that use  frame
                            rate  conversion,  provide  the value as a decimal
                            number for Frame rate. In  this  example,  specify
                            23.976.

                        FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                            When  you  use the API for transcode jobs that use
                            frame rate conversion, specify the frame rate as a
                            fraction.  For example, 24000 / 1001 = 23.976 fps.
                            Use FramerateNumerator to specify the numerator of
                            this  fraction. In this example, use 24000 for the
                            value of FramerateNumerator. When you use the con-
                            sole  for  transcode jobs that use frame rate con-
                            version, provide the value as a decimal number for
                            Framerate. In this example, specify 23.976.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            Specify the XAVC profile for this output. For more
                            information,  see  the   Sony   documentation   at
                            https://www.xavc-info.org/. Note that MediaConvert
                            doesn't support the interlaced video XAVC  operat-
                            ing points for XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG. To create an in-
                            terlaced XAVC output, choose the profile XAVC_HD.

                        SlowPal -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless your input  frame  rate
                            is  23.976  or  24 frames per second (fps). Enable
                            slow PAL to create a 25 fps output  by  relabeling
                            the  video  frames and resampling your audio. Note
                            that enabling this setting  will  slightly  reduce
                            the  duration of your video. Related settings: You
                            must also set Frame rate to 25. In your  JSON  job
                            specification,  set  (framerateControl) to (SPECI-
                            FIED), (framerateNumerator) to 25 and  (framerate-
                            Denominator) to 1.

                        Softness -> (integer)
                            Ignore  this  setting unless your downstream work-
                            flow requires that you specify it explicitly. Oth-
                            erwise,  we recommend that you adjust the softness
                            of your output by using a lower value for the set-
                            ting  Sharpness (sharpness) or by enabling a noise
                            reducer filter (noiseReducerFilter). The  Softness
                            (softness)  setting specifies the quantization ma-
                            trices that the encoder  uses.  Keep  the  default
                            value,  0, for flat quantization. Choose the value
                            1 or 16 to use the default JVT softening quantiza-
                            tion   matricies  from  the  H.264  specification.
                            Choose a value from 17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                            polation.  Increasing values from 17 to 128 result
                            in increasing reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                            The value 128 results in the softest video.

                        SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to
                            keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the  set-
                            ting Adaptive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).
                            When you do so, MediaConvert automatically applies
                            the best types of quantization for your video con-
                            tent. Include this setting in your JSON job speci-
                            fication  only  when  you choose to change the de-
                            fault value for Adaptive  quantization.  For  this
                            setting,  keep  the  default  value,  Enabled (EN-
                            ABLED), to adjust quantization within  each  frame
                            based  on spatial variation of content complexity.
                            When you enable this  feature,  the  encoder  uses
                            fewer  bits on areas that can sustain more distor-
                            tion with no  noticeable  visual  degradation  and
                            uses more bits on areas where any small distortion
                            will be noticeable. For example, complex  textured
                            blocks are encoded with fewer bits and smooth tex-
                            tured blocks are encoded with more bits.  Enabling
                            this feature will almost always improve your video
                            quality. Note, though, that this  feature  doesn't
                            take  into account where the viewer's attention is
                            likely to be. If viewers are likely to be focusing
                            their attention on a part of the screen with a lot
                            of complex texture, you might  choose  to  disable
                            this  feature.  Related  setting:  When you enable
                            spatial adaptive quantization, set the  value  for
                            Adaptive  quantization  (adaptiveQuantization) de-
                            pending on your content. For homogeneous  content,
                            such  as  cartoons and video games, set it to Low.
                            For content with a wider variety of textures,  set
                            it to High or Higher.

                        TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                            The best way to set up adaptive quantization is to

                            When you enable this  feature,  the  encoder  uses
                            fewer  bits on areas of the frame that aren't mov-
                            ing and uses more bits  on  complex  objects  with
                            sharp  edges  that  move  a lot. For example, this
                            feature improves the readability of  text  tickers
                            on  newscasts  and  scoreboards on sports matches.
                            Enabling this feature will almost  always  improve
                            your  video  quality. Note, though, that this fea-

                            screen that doesn't have moving objects with sharp
                            edges, such as sports athletes' faces,  you  might

                               the bitrate of your output. Outputs of the same
                               class have similar image quality over the oper-
                               ating points that are valid for that class.

                        Xavc4kProfileSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set  (Profile)  under  (VideoDe-
                            scription)>(CodecSettings)>(XavcSettings)  to  the
                            value XAVC_4K.

                            BitrateClass -> (string)
                               Specify the XAVC 4k (Long GOP) Bitrate Class to
                               set  the bitrate of your output. Outputs of the
                               same class have similar image quality over  the
                               operating points that are valid for that class.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  the  codec  profile  for  this output.
                               Choose  High,  8-bit,  4:2:0  (HIGH)  or  High,
                               10-bit,  4:2:2  (HIGH_422).  These profiles are
                               specified in ITU-T H.264.

                            FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               The best way to set up adaptive quantization is
                               to keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the
                               setting  Adaptive  quantization  (XavcAdaptive-
                               Quantization). When you do so, MediaConvert au-
                               tomatically applies the best types of quantiza-
                               tion  for your video content. Include this set-
                               ting in your JSON job specification  only  when
                               you  choose  to  change  the  default value for
                               Adaptive quantization. Enable this  setting  to
                               have  the  encoder  reduce I-frame pop. I-frame
                               pop appears as a visual flicker that can  arise
                               when  the  encoder  saves  bits by copying some
                               macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and
                               then  refreshes  them  at the I-frame. When you
                               enable this setting, the encoder updates  these
                               macroblocks  slightly  more often to smooth out
                               the flicker. This setting is  disabled  by  de-
                               fault. Related setting: In addition to enabling
                               this setting, you must also set Adaptive  quan-
                               tization   (adaptiveQuantization)  to  a  value
                               other than Off (OFF) or Auto (AUTO). Use  Adap-
                               tive  quantization  to  adjust  the  degree  of
                               smoothing that  Flicker  adaptive  quantization
                               provides.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  the  encoder uses B-frames as
                               reference frames for other pictures in the same
                               GOP.  Choose  Allow  (ENABLED) to allow the en-
                               coder to  use  B-frames  as  reference  frames.
                               Choose  Don't  allow  (DISABLED) to prevent the
                               encoder  from  using  B-frames   as   reference
                               frames.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Frequency of closed GOPs. In streaming applica-
                               tions, it is recommended that this be set to  1
                               so a decoder joining mid-stream will receive an
                               IDR frame as quickly as possible. Setting  this
                               value to 0 will break output segmenting.

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  size of the buffer that MediaCon-
                               vert uses in the HRD buffer model for this out-
                               put.  Specify  this value in bits; for example,
                               enter five megabits as 5000000. When you  don't
                               set  this  value, or you set it to zero, Media-
                               Convert calculates the default by doubling  the
                               bitrate of this output point.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how you want to  trade  off
                               encoding  speed  for  output video quality. The
                               default behavior is faster, lower quality, sin-
                               gle-pass encoding.

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than

                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-
                               laced pictures.

                               Specify  the  XAVC  Intra HD (CBG) Class to set
                               the bitrate of your output. Outputs of the same
                               class have similar image quality over the oper-
                               ating points that are valid for that class.

                        XavcHdProfileSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set  (Profile)  under  (VideoDe-

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose the scan line type for the output.  Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create a progressive output, regardless of  the
                               scan  type  of  your input. Use Top field first
                               (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom   field   first   (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's inter-
                               laced with the same field polarity  throughout.
                               Use  Follow,  default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course of the output. Follow  behavior  depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced, the output will be interlaced  with  the
                               same  polarity  as the source. If the source is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top  field  bottom  field  first,  depending on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width of rectangle in pixels. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left edge of the video frame. Specify only  even  num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top edge of the video frame. Specify  only  even  num-
                        bers.

                 DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                     Applies  only  to 29.97 fps outputs. When this feature is
                     enabled, the service will use drop-frame timecode on out-
                     puts.  If  it is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                     the system will fall back to non-drop-frame. This setting
                     is  enabled  by  default  when  Timecode insertion (Time-
                     codeInsertion) is enabled.

                 FixedAfd -> (integer)
                     Applies only if you set  AFD  Signaling(AfdSignaling)  to
                     Fixed (FIXED). Use Fixed (FixedAfd) to specify a four-bit
                     AFD value which the service will write on all  frames  of
                     this video output.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Use the Height (Height) setting to define the video reso-
                     lution height for this output. Specify in pixels. If  you
                     don't  provide a value here, the service will use the in-
                     put height.

                 Position -> (structure)
                     Use Selection placement (position) to  define  the  video
                     area  in  your output frame. The area outside of the rec-
                     tangle that you specify here is black.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify only even  num-
                        bers.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Width  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     X -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        left  edge  of the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                     Y -> (integer)
                        The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and the
                        top  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only even num-
                        bers.

                 RespondToAfd -> (string)
                     Use Respond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to specify how the ser-
                     vice  changes  the video itself in response to AFD values
                     in the input. * Choose Respond to clip  the  input  video
                     frame  according  to  the AFD value, input display aspect
                     ratio,  and  output  display  aspect  ratio.   *   Choose
                     Passthrough  to  include  the  input  AFD  values. Do not
                     choose this when AfdSignaling is set to  (NONE).  A  pre-
                     ferred implementation of this workflow is to set Respond-
                     ToAfd to (NONE) and set AfdSignaling to (AUTO). *  Choose
                     None to remove all input AFD values from this output.

                 ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                     Specify  how the service handles outputs that have a dif-
                     ferent aspect ratio from the input aspect  ratio.  Choose
                     Stretch to output (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have the service
                     stretch your video image to fit. Keep the setting Default
                     (DEFAULT)  to  have  the service letterbox your video in-
                     stead. This setting overrides any value that you  specify
                     for  the  setting  Selection placement (position) in this
                     output.

                 Sharpness -> (integer)
                     Use Sharpness (Sharpness) setting to specify the strength
                     of  anti-aliasing.  This setting changes the width of the
                     anti-alias filter kernel used for scaling. Sharpness only
                     applies  if your output resolution is different from your
                     input resolution. 0  is  the  softest  setting,  100  the
                     sharpest, and 50 recommended for most content.

                 TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                     Applies  only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and ProRes outputs.
                     Only enable Timecode insertion when the input frame  rate
                     is  identical  to the output frame rate. To include time-
                     codes in this output, set Timecode insertion  (VideoTime-
                     codeInsertion)  to PIC_TIMING_SEI. To leave them out, set
                     it to DISABLED. Default is DISABLED. When the service in-
                     serts timecodes in an output, by default, it uses any em-
                     bedded timecodes from the input. If none are present, the
                     service  will set the timecode for the first output frame
                     to zero. To change this default behavior, adjust the set-
                     tings  under  Timecode configuration (TimecodeConfig). In
                     the console, these settings are located under Job  >  Job
                     settings > Timecode configuration. Note - Timecode source
                     under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does  not  af-
                     fect  the  timecodes  that  are  inserted  in the output.
                     Source under Job settings > Timecode configuration (Time-
                     codeSource) does.

                 VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)
                     Find  additional transcoding features under Preprocessors
                     (VideoPreprocessors). Enable the features at each  output
                     individually. These features are disabled by default.

                     ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                        Use  these  settings  to convert the color space or to
                        modify properties such as hue and  contrast  for  this
                        output.       For      more      information,      see

                        Brightness -> (integer)
                            Brightness level.

                        ClipLimits -> (structure)
                            Specify YUV limits and RGB tolerances when you set
                            Sample range conversion to Limited range clip.

                            MaximumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                               Specify the Maximum RGB color sample range tol-
                               erance  for  your output. MediaConvert corrects
                               any YUV values that,  when  converted  to  RGB,
                               would  be  outside the upper tolerance that you
                               specify. Enter an integer from 90 to 105 as  an
                               offset   percentage  to  the  maximum  possible
                               value. Leave blank to  use  the  default  value
                               100.  When  you specify a value for Maximum RGB
                               tolerance, you must set Sample range conversion
                               to Limited range clip.

                            MaximumYUV -> (integer)
                               Specify the Maximum YUV color sample limit. Me-
                               diaConvert conforms any pixels  in  your  input
                               above  the  value  that  you specify to typical
                               limited range bounds. Enter an integer from 920
                               to  1023.  Leave blank to use the default value
                               940. The value that you enter applies to 10-bit
                               ranges. For 8-bit ranges, MediaConvert automat-
                               ically scales this value down. When you specify
                               a  value  for  Maximum YUV, you must set Sample
                               range conversion to Limited range clip.

                            MinimumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                               Specify the Minimum RGB color sample range tol-
                               erance  for  your output. MediaConvert corrects
                               any YUV values that,  when  converted  to  RGB,
                               would  be  outside the lower tolerance that you
                               specify. Enter an integer from -5 to 10  as  an
                               offset   percentage  to  the  minimum  possible
                               value. Leave blank to use the default value  0.
                               When you specify a value for Minimum RGB toler-
                               ance, you must set Sample range  conversion  to
                               Limited range clip.

                            MinimumYUV -> (integer)
                               Specify the Minimum YUV color sample limit. Me-
                               diaConvert conforms any pixels  in  your  input
                               below  the  value  that  you specify to typical
                               limited range bounds. Enter an integer  from  0
                               to  128.  Leave  blank to use the default value
                               64. The value that you enter applies to  10-bit
                               ranges. For 8-bit ranges, MediaConvert automat-
                               ically scales this value down. When you specify
                               a  value  for  Minumum YUV, you must set Sample
                               range conversion to Limited range clip.

                        ColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                            Specify the color space you want for this  output.
                            The  service  supports conversion between HDR for-
                            mats, between SDR formats, from SDR  to  HDR,  and
                            from HDR to SDR. SDR to HDR conversion doesn't up-
                            grade the dynamic range. The converted  video  has
                            an HDR format, but visually appears the same as an
                            unconverted output. HDR  to  SDR  conversion  uses
                            tone  mapping  to approximate the outcome of manu-
                            ally regrading from HDR to SDR. When  you  specify
                            an  output color space, MediaConvert uses the fol-
                            lowing color space metadata, which includes  color
                            primaries,  transfer  characteristics,  and matrix
                            coefficients:  *  HDR  10:  BT.2020,  PQ,  BT.2020
                            non-constant  *  HLG  2020:  BT.2020, HLG, BT.2020

                        Contrast -> (integer)
                            Contrast level.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings when you convert to the HDR  10
                            color  space.  Specify the SMPTE ST 2086 Mastering
                            Display Color Volume static metadata that you want
                            signaled  in the output. These values don't affect
                            the pixel values that are  encoded  in  the  video
                            stream.  They  are intended to help the downstream
                            video player display content in  a  way  that  re-
                            flects  the intentions of the the content creator.
                            When you set Color space  conversion  (ColorSpace-
                            Conversion)  to  HDR  10 (FORCE_HDR10), these set-
                            tings are required. You must set  values  for  Max
                            frame   average   light   level  (maxFrameAverage-
                            LightLevel) and Max content light  level  (maxCon-
                            tentLightLevel);  these  settings don't have a de-
                            fault value. The default values for the other  HDR
                            10  metadata  settings  are  defined  by the P3D65
                            color space. For more information about  MediaCon-

                        HdrToSdrToneMapper -> (string)
                            Specify  how MediaConvert maps brightness and col-
                            ors from your HDR input to your  SDR  output.  The
                            mode that you select represents a creative choice,
                            with different tradeoffs in the details and  tones
                            of  your  output. To maintain details in bright or
                            saturated areas of your  output:  Choose  Preserve
                            details.  For  some  sources,  your SDR output may
                            look less bright and less saturated when  compared
                            to your HDR source. MediaConvert automatically ap-
                            plies this mode for  HLG  sources,  regardless  of
                            your  choice.  For  a bright and saturated output:
                            Choose Vibrant. We recommend that you choose  this
                            mode when any of your source content is HDR10, and
                            for the best results when it is mastered for  1000
                            nits.  You may notice loss of details in bright or
                            saturated areas of your output. HDR  to  SDR  tone
                            mapping has no effect when your input is SDR.

                        Hue -> (integer)
                            Hue in degrees.

                        SampleRangeConversion -> (string)
                            Specify  how  MediaConvert limits the color sample
                            range for this output. To create a  limited  range
                            output  from  a  full  range input: Choose Limited
                            range squeeze. For full range inputs, MediaConvert
                            performs  a linear offset to color samples equally
                            across all pixels and  frames.  Color  samples  in
                            10-bit  outputs are limited to 64 through 940, and
                            8-bit outputs are limited to 16 through 235. Note:
                            For limited range inputs, values for color samples
                            are passed through to your output unchanged. Medi-
                            aConvert  does not limit the sample range. To cor-
                            rect pixels in your input that are out of range or
                            out  of  gamut: Choose Limited range clip. Use for
                            broadcast applications. MediaConvert conforms  any
                            pixels  outside of the values that you specify un-
                            der Minimum YUV and Maximum YUV to  limited  range
                            bounds.  MediaConvert also corrects any YUV values
                            that, when converted to RGB, would be outside  the
                            bounds you specify under Minimum RGB tolerance and
                            Maximum RGB tolerance. With either  limited  range
                            conversion,  MediaConvert  writes the sample range
                            metadata in the output.

                        Saturation -> (integer)
                            Saturation level.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify the reference white level,  in  nits,  for
                            all  of your SDR inputs. Use to correct brightness
                            levels within HDR10 outputs. The  following  color
                            metadata  must be present in your SDR input: color
                            primaries, transfer  characteristics,  and  matrix
                            coefficients.  If your SDR input has missing color
                            metadata, or if you want to  correct  input  color
                            metadata,  manually  specify  a color space in the
                            input video selector. For 1,000 nit  peak  bright-
                            ness  displays, we recommend that you set SDR ref-
                            erence white level  to  203  (according  to  ITU-R
                            BT.2408).  Leave blank to use the default value of
                            100, or specify an integer from 100 to 1000.

                     Deinterlacer -> (structure)
                        Use the deinterlacer to produce smoother motion and  a
                        clearer    picture.    For   more   information,   see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-scan-type.html.

                        Algorithm -> (string)
                            Only  applies  when  you  set  Deinterlace mode to
                            Deinterlace  or  Adaptive.  Interpolate   produces
                            sharper  pictures,  while  blend produces smoother
                            motion. If your source  file  includes  a  ticker,
                            such  as a scrolling headline at the bottom of the
                            frame: Choose Interpolate ticker or Blend  ticker.
                            To  apply field doubling: Choose Linear interpola-
                            tion. Note that Linear interpolation may introduce
                            video artifacts into your output.

                        Control -> (string)

                            o When  set  to NORMAL (default), the deinterlacer
                              does not convert frames that are tagged in meta-
                              data  as progressive. It will only convert those
                              that are tagged as some other type. -  When  set
                              to  FORCE_ALL_FRAMES,  the deinterlacer converts
                              every frame to progressive - even those that are
                              already  tagged  as progressive. Turn Force mode
                              on only if there is a good chance that the meta-
                              data  has tagged frames as progressive when they
                              are not progressive. Do not turn  on  otherwise;
                              processing  frames  that are already progressive
                              into progressive will probably result  in  lower
                              quality video.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            Use  Deinterlacer  (DeinterlaceMode) to choose how
                            the service  will  do  deinterlacing.  Default  is
                            Deinterlace.  - Deinterlace converts interlaced to
                            progressive.  -  Inverse  telecine  converts  Hard
                            Telecine 29.97i to progressive 23.976p. - Adaptive
                            auto-detects and converts to progressive.

                     DolbyVision -> (structure)
                        Enable Dolby Vision feature to  produce  Dolby  Vision
                        compatible video output.

                        L6Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use  these  settings  when  you  set  DolbyVision-
                            Level6Mode to SPECIFY to override the  MaxCLL  and
                            MaxFALL values in your input with new values.

                            MaxCll -> (integer)
                               Maximum  Content  Light Level. Static HDR meta-
                               data that corresponds to the brightest pixel in
                               the entire stream. Measured in nits.

                            MaxFall -> (integer)
                               Maximum  Frame-Average  Light Level. Static HDR
                               metadata  that  corresponds  to   the   highest
                               frame-average  brightness in the entire stream.
                               Measured in nits.

                        L6Mode -> (string)
                            Use Dolby Vision Mode to choose  how  the  service
                            will   handle  Dolby  Vision  MaxCLL  and  MaxFALL
                            properies.

                        Mapping -> (string)
                            Required when you set Dolby Vision Profile to Pro-
                            file  8.1.  When  you set Content mapping to None,
                            content mapping is not applied to  the  HDR10-com-
                            patible  signal.  Depending on the source peak nit
                            level, clipping might occur on HDR devices without
                            Dolby  Vision.  When  you  set  Content mapping to
                            HDR10 1000, the transcoder creates  a  1,000  nits
                            peak  HDR10-compatible  signal  by applying static
                            content  mapping  to  the  source.  This  mode  is
                            speed-optimized  for  PQ10  sources  with metadata
                            that is created from analysis.  For  graded  Dolby
                            Vision  content,  be  aware  that  creative intent
                            might not be guaranteed with  extreme  1,000  nits
                            trims.

                        Profile -> (string)
                            Required when you enable Dolby Vision. Use Profile
                            5 to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vision  meta-
                            data in your output. Your input must include Dolby
                            Vision metadata or an HDR10 YUV color  space.  Use
                            Profile 8.1 to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vi-
                            sion metadata and HDR10 metadata in  your  output.
                            Your input must include Dolby Vision metadata.

                     Hdr10Plus -> (structure)
                        Enable HDR10+ analyis and metadata injection. Compati-
                        ble with HEVC only.

                        MasteringMonitorNits -> (integer)
                            Specify the HDR10+  mastering  display  normalized
                            peak  luminance,  in  nits. This is the normalized
                            actual peak luminance of the mastering display, as
                            defined by ST 2094-40.

                        TargetMonitorNits -> (integer)
                            Specify the HDR10+ target display nominal peak lu-
                            minance, in nits. This is the nominal maximum  lu-
                            minance  of  the  target  display as defined by ST
                            2094-40.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the Image inserter (ImageInserter)  feature  to
                        include  a  graphic  overlay  on your video. Enable or
                        disable this feature  for  each  output  individually.
                        This setting is disabled by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify  the  images  that  you want to overlay on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These settings  apply  to  a  specific  graphic
                               overlay.  You  can include multiple overlays in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify the time, in milliseconds, for  the
                                   image  to  remain on the output video. This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify  for  the  image insertion and the time
                                   that the image  appears  at  full  opacity.
                                   Full  opacity is the level that you specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for Fade-in, the image will ap-
                                   pear abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds,  between the end of the time that you
                                   have specified for the image overlay  Dura-
                                   tion  and when the overlaid image has faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear abruptly at the end  of  the  inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger  than  the  video resolution height,
                                   the service will crop your  overlaid  image
                                   to fit. To use the native height of the im-
                                   age, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion  of the image that you want to overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the overlaid image and the top edge of  the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify how overlapping inserted images ap-
                                   pear.  Images  with higher values for Layer
                                   appear on top of images with  lower  values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use  Opacity  (Opacity) to specify how much
                                   of the underlying video shows  through  the
                                   inserted image. 0 is transparent and 100 is
                                   fully opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify the timecode of the frame that  you
                                   want  the  overlay to first appear on. This
                                   must  be  in   timecode   (HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF)  format. Remember to take into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify the width of the inserted image  in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service  will  crop  your overlaid image to
                                   fit. To use the native width of the  image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  reference  white level, in nits, for
                            all of your image inserter images. Use to  correct
                            brightness  levels within HDR10 outputs. For 1,000
                            nit peak brightness displays,  we  recommend  that
                            you  set SDR reference white level to 203 (accord-
                            ing to ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank to use the  de-
                            fault value of 100, or specify an integer from 100
                            to 1000.

                     NoiseReducer -> (structure)
                        Enable the Noise reducer feature to remove noise  from
                        your video output if necessary. Enable or disable this
                        feature for each output individually. This setting  is
                        disabled  by  default.  When you enable Noise reducer,
                        you must also select a value for Noise reducer filter.
                        For  AVC  outputs, when you include Noise reducer, you
                        cannot include the Bandwidth reduction filter.

                        Filter -> (string)
                            Use Noise reducer filter  (NoiseReducerFilter)  to
                            select  one of the following spatial image filter-
                            ing functions. To use this setting, you must  also
                            enable  Noise  reducer (NoiseReducer). * Bilateral
                            preserves  edges  while  reducing  noise.  *  Mean

                        FilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings for a noise reducer filter

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Relative strength  of  noise  reducing  filter.
                               Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                        SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Noise reducer filter settings for spatial filter.

                            PostFilterSharpenStrength -> (integer)
                               Specify strength of post noise reduction sharp-
                               ening filter, with 0 disabling the filter and 3
                               enabling it at maximum strength.

                            Speed -> (integer)
                               The  speed of the filter, from -2 (lower speed)
                               to 3 (higher speed), with 0 being  the  nominal
                               value.

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Relative  strength  of  noise  reducing filter.
                               Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                        TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                            Noise reducer filter settings for temporal filter.

                            AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                               Use Aggressive mode for content that  has  com-
                               plex  motion.  Higher  values  produce stronger
                               temporal filtering. This filters highly complex
                               scenes  more aggressively and creates better VQ
                               for low bitrate outputs.

                            PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                               When you set Noise  reducer  (noiseReducer)  to
                               Temporal  (TEMPORAL),  the bandwidth and sharp-
                               ness of your output is reduced. You can option-
                               ally  use  Post temporal sharpening (postTempo-
                               ralSharpening) to apply sharpening to the edges
                               of  your output. Note that Post temporal sharp-
                               ening will also make  the  bandwidth  reduction
                               from the Noise reducer smaller. The default be-
                               havior, Auto (AUTO), allows the  transcoder  to
                               determine  whether to apply sharpening, depend-
                               ing on your input type and  quality.  When  you
                               set  Post  temporal  sharpening to Enabled (EN-
                               ABLED), specify how much sharpening is  applied
                               using  Post temporal sharpening strength (post-
                               TemporalSharpeningStrength). Set Post  temporal
                               sharpening  to Disabled (DISABLED) to not apply
                               sharpening.

                            PostTemporalSharpeningStrength -> (string)
                               Use Post temporal sharpening strength (postTem-
                               poralSharpeningStrength)  to  define the amount
                               of sharpening the transcoder  applies  to  your
                               output.  Set  Post temporal sharpening strength
                               to Low (LOW), Medium (MEDIUM), or  High  (HIGH)
                               to indicate the amount of sharpening.

                            Speed -> (integer)
                               The  speed  of  the  filter  (higher  number is
                               faster). Low setting reduces bit  rate  at  the
                               cost  of  transcode time, high setting improves
                               transcode time at the cost of bit rate.

                            Strength -> (integer)
                               Specify the strength of the noise reducing fil-
                               ter  on  this  output.  Higher  values  produce
                               stronger filtering. We recommend the  following
                               value  ranges, depending on the result that you
                               want: * 0-2 for complexity reduction with mini-
                               mal  sharpness loss * 2-8 for complexity reduc-
                               tion with image preservation * 8-16 for a  high
                               level of complexity reduction

                               ID for each asset you  watermark,  and  keep  a
                               record  of  which  ID you have assigned to each
                               asset.  Neither  Nagra  nor  MediaConvert  keep
                               track  of the relationship between output files
                               and your IDs. For  OTT  Streaming,  create  two
                               adaptive  bitrate  (ABR) stacks for each asset.
                               Do this by setting up two  output  groups.  For
                               one  output  group, set the value of Payload ID
                               (payload) to 0 in every output. For  the  other
                               output  group, set Payload ID (payload) to 1 in
                               every output.

                            Preset -> (string)
                               Enter one of the  watermarking  preset  strings
                               that  Nagra provides you. Required when you in-
                               clude Nagra NexGuard File  Marker  watermarking
                               (NexGuardWatermarkingSettings) in your job.

                            Strength -> (string)
                               Optional. Ignore this setting unless Nagra sup-
                               port directs you to specify a value.  When  you
                               don't  specify a value here, the Nagra NexGuard
                               library uses its default value.

                     TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                        Settings for burning the output timecode and specified
                        prefix into the output.

                        FontSize -> (integer)
                            Use  Font  Size (FontSize) to set the font size of
                            any burned-in timecode. Valid values are  10,  16,
                            32, 48.

                        Position -> (string)
                            Use   Position  (Position)  under  under  Timecode
                            burn-in (TimecodeBurnIn) to specify  the  location
                            the burned-in timecode on output video.

                        Prefix -> (string)
                            Use  Prefix (Prefix) to place ASCII characters be-
                            fore any burned-in timecode. For example, a prefix
                            of    "EZ-"    will   result   in   the   timecode
                            "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide  either  the  characters
                            themselves or the ASCII code equivalents. The sup-
                            ported range of characters is 0x20  through  0x7e.
                            This  includes  letters,  numbers, and all special
                            characters represented on a standard English  key-
                            board.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Use  Width  (Width) to define the video resolution width,
                     in pixels, for this output. If you don't provide a  value
                     here, the service will use the input width.

          Type -> (string)
              A  preset  can  be  of  two  types:  system or custom. System or
              built-in preset can't be modified or deleted by the user.
