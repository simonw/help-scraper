LIST-QUEUES()                                                    LIST-QUEUES()



NAME
       list-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve  a JSON array of up to twenty of your queues. This will return
       the queues themselves, not just a list of them. To  retrieve  the  next
       twenty queues, use the nextToken string returned with the array.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-queues  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Queues

SYNOPSIS
            list-queues
          [--list-by <value>]
          [--order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --list-by (string) Optional. When you request a list of queues, you can
       choose  to  list them alphabetically by NAME or chronologically by CRE-
       ATION_DATE. If you don't specify, the service will list  them  by  cre-
       ation date.
          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATION_DATE

       --order (string) Optional. When you request lists of resources, you can
       specify whether they are sorted in ASCENDING or DESCENDING  order.  De-
       fault varies by resource.
          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Use this string to request the next batch of queues.

       Queues -> (list)
          List of queues.

          (structure)
              You can use queues to manage the resources that are available to
              your  AWS  account  for running multiple transcoding jobs at the
              same time. If you don't specify a queue, the service  sends  all
              jobs  through  the  default  queue.  For  more  information, see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-queues.html.

              Arn -> (string)
                 An  identifier for this resource that is unique within all of
                 AWS.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch  seconds  for  when  you  created  the
                 queue.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description that you create for each queue.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you most recently up-
                 dated the queue.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name that you create for each  queue.  Each  name  must  be
                 unique within your account.

              PricingPlan -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the pricing plan for the queue is on-demand
                 or reserved. For on-demand, you pay per minute, billed in in-
                 crements  of  .01  minute.  For  reserved,  you  pay  for the
                 transcoding capacity of the entire queue, regardless  of  how
                 much  or  how  little you use it. Reserved pricing requires a
                 12-month commitment.

              ProgressingJobsCount -> (integer)
                 The estimated number of jobs with a PROGRESSING status.

              ReservationPlan -> (structure)
                 Details about the pricing plan for your reserved  queue.  Re-
                 quired  for  reserved  queues and not applicable to on-demand
                 queues.

                 Commitment -> (string)
                     The length of the term of  your  reserved  queue  pricing
                     plan commitment.

                 ExpiresAt -> (timestamp)
                     The timestamp in epoch seconds for when the current pric-
                     ing plan term for this reserved queue expires.

                 PurchasedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The timestamp in epoch seconds for when you  set  up  the
                     current pricing plan for this reserved queue.

                 RenewalType -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the term of your reserved queue pricing
                     plan is automatically extended  (AUTO_RENEW)  or  expires
                     (EXPIRE) at the end of the term.

                 ReservedSlots -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  number  of reserved transcode slots (RTS)
                     for this queue. The number of  RTS  determines  how  many
                     jobs  the  queue  can  process  in parallel; each RTS can
                     process one job at a time. When you increase this number,
                     you  extend  your existing commitment with a new 12-month
                     commitment for a larger number of RTS. The new commitment
                     begins  when  you  purchase  the additional capacity. You
                     can't decrease the number of RTS in your reserved queue.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the  pricing  plan  for  your  reserved
                     queue is ACTIVE or EXPIRED.

              Status -> (string)
                 Queues  can  be  ACTIVE  or PAUSED. If you pause a queue, the
                 service won't begin processing jobs in that queue. Jobs  that
                 are  running  when  you pause the queue continue to run until
                 they finish or result in an error.

              SubmittedJobsCount -> (integer)
                 The estimated number of jobs with a SUBMITTED status.

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies whether this on-demand queue is system  or  custom.
                 System queues are built in. You can't modify or delete system
                 queues. You can create and modify custom queues.
