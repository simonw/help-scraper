LIST-PRESETS()                                                  LIST-PRESETS()



NAME
       list-presets -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieve a JSON array of up to twenty of your presets. This will return
       the presets themselves, not just a list of them. To retrieve  the  next
       twenty presets, use the nextToken string returned with the array.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-presets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Presets

OPTIONS
       --category (string) Optionally, specify a preset category to limit  re-
       sponses to only presets from that category.

       --list-by  (string)  Optional.  When you request a list of presets, you
       can choose to list them alphabetically by NAME  or  chronologically  by
       CREATION_DATE.  If  you  don't  specify,  the service will list them by
       name.
          Possible values:

          o NAME

          o CREATION_DATE

          o SYSTEM

       --order (string) Optional. When you request lists of resources, you can
       specify  whether  they are sorted in ASCENDING or DESCENDING order. De-
       fault varies by resource.
          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          Use this string to request the next batch of presets.

       Presets -> (list)
          List of presets

          (structure)
              A preset is a collection of preconfigured media conversion  set-
              tings  that  you want MediaConvert to apply to the output during
              the conversion process.

              Arn -> (string)
                 An identifier for this resource that is unique within all  of
                 AWS.

              Category -> (string)
                 An optional category you create to organize your presets.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp in epoch seconds for preset creation.

              Description -> (string)
                 An optional description you create for each preset.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  in epoch seconds when the preset was last up-
                 dated.

              Name -> (string)
                 A name you create for each preset. Each name must  be  unique
                 within your account.

              Settings -> (structure)
                 Settings for preset

                 AudioDescriptions -> (list)
                     (AudioDescriptions)  contains  groups  of  audio encoding
                     settings organized by audio codec. Include  one  instance
                     of  (AudioDescriptions)  per  output. (AudioDescriptions)
                     can contain multiple groups of encoding settings.

                     (structure)
                        Settings related to one audio tab on the  MediaConvert
                        console.  In  your  job  JSON, an instance of AudioDe-
                        scription is equivalent to one audio tab in  the  con-
                        sole. Usually, one audio tab corresponds to one output
                        audio track. Depending on how you set  up  your  input
                        audio  selectors  and  whether  you use audio selector
                        groups, one audio tab can correspond  to  a  group  of
                        output audio tracks.

                        AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                            When  you  mimic a multi-channel audio layout with
                            multiple mono-channel tracks,  you  can  tag  each
                            channel  layout  manually.  For example, you would
                            tag the tracks that contain your left, right,  and
                            center  audio with Left (L), Right (R), and Center
                            (C), respectively. When you don't specify a value,
                            MediaConvert  labels  your  track as Center (C) by
                            default. To use audio layout tagging, your  output
                            must  be in a QuickTime (.mov) container; your au-
                            dio codec must be AAC, WAV, or AIFF; and you  must
                            set up your audio track to have only one channel.

                            ChannelTag -> (string)
                               You  can  add a tag for this mono-channel audio
                               track to mimic its placement in a multi-channel
                               layout.  For example, if this track is the left
                               surround channel, choose Left surround (LS).

                        AudioNormalizationSettings -> (structure)
                            Advanced  audio  normalization  settings.   Ignore
                            these  settings  unless  you need to comply with a
                            loudness standard.

                            Algorithm -> (string)
                               Choose one of the following audio normalization
                               algorithms:  ITU-R BS.1770-1: Ungated loudness.
                               A measurement of ungated average  loudness  for

                               as 7.1.

                            AlgorithmControl -> (string)
                               When  enabled the output audio is corrected us-
                               ing the chosen algorithm. If disabled, the  au-
                               dio will be measured but not adjusted.

                            CorrectionGateLevel -> (integer)
                               Content measuring above this level will be cor-
                               rected to the target level.  Content  measuring
                               below this level will not be corrected.

                            LoudnessLogging -> (string)
                               If  set  to  LOG, log each output's audio track
                               loudness to a CSV file.

                            PeakCalculation -> (string)
                               If set to  TRUE_PEAK,  calculate  and  log  the
                               TruePeak  for  each  output's audio track loud-
                               ness.

                            TargetLkfs -> (double)
                               When you use Audio normalization  (AudioNormal-
                               izationSettings),  optionally  use this setting
                               to specify a  target  loudness.  If  you  don't
                               specify  a  value  here,  the encoder chooses a
                               value for you, based on the algorithm that  you
                               choose for Algorithm (algorithm). If you choose
                               algorithm 1770-1, the encoder will  choose  -24
                               LKFS;  otherwise,  the  encoder will choose -23
                               LKFS.

                            TruePeakLimiterThreshold -> (double)
                               Specify  the  True-peak  limiter  threshold  in
                               decibels  relative  to  full  scale (dBFS). The
                               peak inter-audio sample loudness in your output
                               will  be limited to the value that you specify,
                               without affecting the overall target LKFS.  En-
                               ter  a  value from 0 to -20. Leave blank to use
                               the default value 0.

                        AudioSourceName -> (string)
                            Specifies which audio data to use from each input.
                            In  the  simplest  case,  specify an "Audio Selec-
                            tor":#inputs-audio_selector by name based  on  its
                            order  within each input. For example if you spec-
                            ify "Audio Selector 3", then the third  audio  se-
                            lector  will  be used from each input. If an input
                            does not have an "Audio Selector 3", then the  au-
                            dio  selector  marked  as  "default" in that input
                            will be used. If there is no audio selector marked
                            as "default", silence will be inserted for the du-
                            ration of that input. Alternatively, an "Audio Se-
                            lector   Group":#inputs-audio_selector_group  name
                            may be specified, with similar default/silence be-
                            havior. If no audio_source_name is specified, then
                            "Audio Selector 1" will be chosen automatically.

                        AudioType -> (integer)
                            Applies  only  if  Follow  Input  Audio  Type   is
                            unchecked (false). A number between 0 and 255. The
                            following are defined in ISO-IEC 13818-1: 0 =  Un-
                            defined,  1 = Clean Effects, 2 = Hearing Impaired,
                            3 = Visually  Impaired  Commentary,  4-255  =  Re-
                            served.

                        AudioTypeControl -> (string)
                            When set to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input contains an
                            ISO 639 audio_type,  then  that  value  is  passed
                            through  to  the  output. If the input contains no
                            ISO 639 audio_type, the value in Audio Type is in-
                            cluded in the output. Otherwise the value in Audio
                            Type is included in the  output.  Note  that  this
                            field  and  audioType are both ignored if audioDe-
                            scriptionBroadcasterMix   is   set    to    BROAD-
                            CASTER_MIXED_AD.

                        CodecSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to audio encoding. The settings
                            in this group vary depending on the value that you
                            choose for your audio codec.

                            AacSettings -> (structure)
                               Required  when  you set (Codec) under (AudioDe-
                               scriptions)>(CodecSettings) to the  value  AAC.
                               The  service accepts one of two mutually exclu-
                               sive groups of AAC settings--VBR  and  CBR.  To
                               select one of these modes, set the value of Bi-
                               trate control mode (rateControlMode)  to  "VBR"
                               or  "CBR".  In  VBR mode, you control the audio
                               quality with the setting VBR quality  (vbrQual-
                               ity).  In CBR mode, you use the setting Bitrate
                               (bitrate). Defaults and valid values depend  on
                               the rate control mode.

                               AudioDescriptionBroadcasterMix -> (string)
                                   Choose  BROADCASTER_MIXED_AD when the input
                                   contains pre-mixed main audio +  audio  de-
                                   scription  (AD) as a stereo pair. The value
                                   for AudioType will be set to 3, which  sig-
                                   nals to downstream systems that this stream
                                   contains "broadcaster mixed AD". Note  that
                                   the input received by the encoder must con-
                                   tain pre-mixed audio; the encoder does  not
                                   perform  the mixing. When you choose BROAD-
                                   CASTER_MIXED_AD, the  encoder  ignores  any
                                   values you provide in AudioType and Follow-
                                   InputAudioType. Choose NORMAL when the  in-
                                   put  does not contain pre-mixed audio + au-
                                   dio description (AD). In this case, the en-
                                   coder  will  use any values you provide for
                                   AudioType and FollowInputAudioType.

                               Bitrate -> (integer)
                                   Specify the average  bitrate  in  bits  per
                                   second.  The  set  of valid values for this
                                   setting  is:  6000,  8000,  10000,   12000,
                                   14000,  16000,  20000, 24000, 28000, 32000,
                                   40000, 48000, 56000, 64000,  80000,  96000,
                                   112000,  128000,  160000,  192000,  224000,
                                   256000,  288000,  320000,  384000,  448000,
                                   512000,  576000,  640000,  768000,  896000,
                                   1024000. The value you  set  is  also  con-
                                   strained  by the values that you choose for
                                   Profile  (codecProfile),  Bitrate   control
                                   mode  (codingMode),  and  Sample rate (sam-
                                   pleRate). Default values depend on  Bitrate
                                   control mode and Profile.

                               CodecProfile -> (string)

                               CodingMode -> (string)
                                   The Coding mode that you specify determines
                                   the number of audio channels and the  audio
                                   channel layout metadata in your AAC output.
                                   Valid coding modes depend on the Rate  con-
                                   trol  mode and Profile that you select. The
                                   following list shows the  number  of  audio
                                   channels and channel layout for each coding
                                   mode. *  1.0  Audio  Description  (Receiver

                                   Enables LATM/LOAS AAC output. Note that  if
                                   you  use  LATM/LOAS  AAC  in an output, you
                                   must choose "No container" for  the  output
                                   container.

                               SampleRate -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Sample rate in Hz. Valid sample
                                   rates depend on the Profile and Coding mode
                                   that  you  select. The following list shows
                                   valid sample rates  for  each  Profile  and

                                   When  you  want  to add Dolby dynamic range
                                   compression (DRC) signaling to your  output
                                   stream,  we  recommend  that  you  use  the
                                   mode-specific settings instead  of  Dynamic
                                   range compression profile (DynamicRangeCom-
                                   pressionProfile).  The  mode-specific  set-
                                   tings  are  Dynamic  range compression pro-
                                   file, line  mode  (dynamicRangeCompression-
                                   Line)  and  Dynamic  range compression pro-
                                   file, RF mode  (dynamicRangeCompressionRf).
                                   Note  that  when you specify values for all
                                   three settings,  MediaConvert  ignores  the
                                   value  of  this  setting  in  favor  of the
                                   mode-specific settings. If you do use  this
                                   setting  instead  of the mode-specific set-
                                   tings, choose None (NONE) to leave out  DRC
                                   signaling.  Keep  the default Film standard
                                   (FILM_STANDARD)  to  set  the  profile   to
                                   Dolby's film standard profile for all oper-

                               LfeControl -> (string)
                                   When  encoding  3/2 audio, controls whether
                                   the LFE channel is enabled

                               LfeFilter -> (string)
                                   Applies a 120Hz lowpass filter to  the  LFE
                                   channel  prior to encoding. Only valid with

                                   center  mix  (Lo/Ro  center).  MediaConvert
                                   uses  this  value  for  downmixing. How the
                                   service uses  this  value  depends  on  the
                                   value  that  you  choose for Stereo downmix
                                   (Eac3StereoDownmix).  Valid  values:   3.0,
                                   1.5,  0.0, -1.5, -3.0, -4.5, -6.0, and -60.
                                   The value -60 mutes the channel. This  set-
                                   ting  applies  only if you keep the default
                                   value of 3/2  -  L,  R,  C,  Ls,  Rs  (COD-

                                   (Lo/Ro  surround).  MediaConvert  uses this
                                   value for downmixing. How the service  uses
                                   this  value  depends  on the value that you
                                   choose for Stereo downmix  (Eac3StereoDown-
                                   mix). Valid values: -1.5, -3.0, -4.5, -6.0,
                                   and -60. The value -60 mutes  the  channel.
                                   This  setting  applies only if you keep the
                                   default value of 3/2 -  L,  R,  C,  Ls,  Rs

                                   will be sourced from the DD, DD+, or DolbyE
                                   decoder that supplied this audio  data.  If
                                   audio  was  not  supplied from one of these
                                   streams, then the static metadata  settings
                                   will be used.

                                   value is 48000.

                            VorbisSettings -> (structure)
                               Required when you  set  Codec,  under  AudioDe-
                               scriptions>CodecSettings, to the value Vorbis.

                               Channels -> (integer)
                                   Optional. Specify the number of channels in
                                   this output audio track. Choosing  Mono  on
                                   the  console  gives  you  1 output channel;
                                   choosing Stereo gives you 2.  In  the  API,
                                   valid values are 1 and 2. The default value
                                   is 2.

                               SampleRate -> (integer)
                                   Optional. Specify the audio sample rate  in
                                   Hz.  Valid  values are 22050, 32000, 44100,

                               VbrQuality -> (integer)
                                   Optional. Specify the variable audio  qual-
                                   ity  of  this Vorbis output from -1 (lowest
                                   quality, ~45 kbit/s) to 10  (highest  qual-
                                   ity,  ~500  kbit/s). The default value is 4
                                   (~128 kbit/s). Values 5 and 6 are  approxi-
                                   mately 160 and 192 kbit/s, respectively.

                            WavSettings -> (structure)
                               Required  when  you set (Codec) under (AudioDe-

                               BitDepth -> (integer)
                                   Specify Bit depth (BitDepth), in  bits  per
                                   sample,  to choose the encoding quality for
                                   this audio track.

                               Channels -> (integer)
                                   Specify the number of channels in this out-
                                   put  audio  track.  Valid  values are 1 and
                                   even numbers up to 64. For example,  1,  2,
                                   4, 6, and so on, up to 64.

                               Format -> (string)
                                   The  service defaults to using RIFF for WAV
                                   outputs. If your output audio is likely  to
                                   exceed  4 GB in file size, or if you other-
                                   wise need the extended support of the  RF64
                                   format,  set your output WAV file format to
                                   RF64.

                               SampleRate -> (integer)
                                   Sample rate in Hz.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify the language for this audio output  track.
                            The service puts this language code into your out-
                            put audio track when you set Language code control
                            (AudioLanguageCodeControl)   to   Use   configured
                            (USE_CONFIGURED). The service also uses your spec-
                            ified  custom  language code when you set Language
                            code control (AudioLanguageCodeControl) to  Follow
                            input  (FOLLOW_INPUT), but your input file doesn't
                            specify a language code. For all outputs, you  can
                            use  an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3 code. For streaming
                            outputs, you can also use any other  code  in  the
                            full RFC-5646 specification. Streaming outputs are
                            those that are in  one  of  the  following  output
                            groups:  CMAF,  DASH  ISO, Apple HLS, or Microsoft
                            Smooth Streaming.

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Indicates the language of the audio output  track.
                            The  ISO  639  language specified in the 'Language
                            Code' drop down will be used  when  'Follow  Input
                            Language Code' is not selected or when 'Follow In-
                            put Language Code' is selected but there is no ISO
                            639 language code specified by the input.

                        LanguageCodeControl -> (string)
                            Specify  which  source  for  language  code  takes
                            precedence for this audio track. When  you  choose
                            Follow  input (FOLLOW_INPUT), the service uses the
                            language  code  from  the  input  track  if   it's
                            present.  If  there's no languge code on the input
                            track, the service uses the code that you  specify
                            in the setting Language code (languageCode or cus-
                            tomLanguageCode). When you choose  Use  configured
                            (USE_CONFIGURED),  the  service  uses the language
                            code that you specify.

                        RemixSettings -> (structure)
                            Advanced audio remixing settings.

                            ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                               Channel mapping (ChannelMapping)  contains  the
                               group  of  fields  that hold the remixing value
                               for each channel, in dB. Specify  remix  values
                               to  indicate  how much of the content from your
                               input audio channel you want in your output au-
                               dio  channels.  Each instance of the InputChan-
                               nels or InputChannelsFineTune  array  specifies
                               these  values  for  one output channel. Use one
                               instance of this array for each output channel.
                               In  the  console,  each  array corresponds to a
                               column in the graphical depiction of  the  map-
                               ping  matrix.  The rows of the graphical matrix
                               correspond to input channels. Valid values  are
                               within  the  range from -60 (mute) through 6. A
                               setting of 0 passes the input channel unchanged
                               to the output channel (no attenuation or ampli-
                               fication). Use InputChannels or  InputChannels-
                               FineTune  to  specify  your remix values. Don't
                               use both.

                               OutputChannels -> (list)
                                   In your JSON job specification, include one
                                   child  of  OutputChannels  for  each  audio
                                   channel that you want in your output.  Each
                                   child  should  contain  one instance of In-
                                   putChannels or InputChannelsFineTune.

                                      InputChannelsFineTune -> (list)
                                          Use this  setting  to  specify  your
                                          remix  values when they have a deci-
                                          mal  component,  such  as   -10.312,
                                          0.08,  or  4.9.  MediaConvert rounds
                                          your remixing values to the  nearest
                                          thousandth.

                            ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                               Specify  the number of audio channels from your
                               input that you want to use in your output. With
                               remixing,  you  might combine or split the data
                               in these channels, so the number of channels in
                               your  final  output  might be different. If you
                               are doing both input channel mapping and output
                               channel  mapping, the number of output channels
                               in your input mapping must be the same  as  the
                               number  of  input  channels in your output map-

                               Specify the number of channels in  this  output
                               after  remixing. Valid values: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8...
                               64. (1 and even numbers to 64.) If you are  do-

                               nel mapping, the number of output  channels  in
                               your input mapping must be the same as the num-
                               ber of input channels in your output mapping.

                        StreamName -> (string)
                            Specify a label for this output audio stream.  For
                            example,   "English",  "Director  commentary",  or
                            "track_2".  For  streaming  outputs,  MediaConvert
                            passes this information into destination manifests
                            for display on the end-viewer's player device. For
                            outputs  in  other  output groups, the service ig-

                 CaptionDescriptions -> (list)
                     This object holds groups of settings related to  captions
                     for  one  output.  For each output that has captions, in-
                     clude one instance of CaptionDescriptions.

                        CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify the  language  for  this  captions  output
                            track.  For  most captions output formats, the en-
                            coder puts this language information in the output
                            captions  metadata. If your output captions format
                            is DVB-Sub or Burn in, the encoder uses this  lan-
                            guage information when automatically selecting the
                            font script for rendering the captions  text.  For
                            all outputs, you can use an ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                            code. For streaming outputs, you can also use  any
                            other  code  in  the  full RFC-5646 specification.
                            Streaming outputs are those that are in one of the
                            following  output  groups:  CMAF,  DASH ISO, Apple
                            HLS, or Microsoft Smooth Streaming.

                            captions DestinationSettings is equivalent to  one
                            captions tab in the console. Usually, one captions
                            tab corresponds to one output captions track.  De-

                               Alignment -> (string)
                                   Specify  the alignment of your captions. If
                                   no explicit x_position is provided, setting
                                   alignment  to  centered  will placethe cap-
                                   tions at the bottom center of  the  output.
                                   Similarly,   setting   a   left   alignment
                                   willalign captions to the  bottom  left  of
                                   the  output. If x and y positions are given
                                   in conjunction with the  alignment  parame-
                                   ter,  the  font  will  be justified (either
                                   left or centered) relative to those coordi-
                                   nates.

                               ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore    this    setting    unless   Style
                                   passthrough (StylePassthrough)  is  set  to
                                   Enabled  and  Font color (FontColor) set to
                                   Black, Yellow, Red, Green,  Blue,  or  Hex.
                                   Use  Apply  font color (ApplyFontColor) for
                                   additional font color  controls.  When  you
                                   choose  White  text only (WHITE_TEXT_ONLY),
                                   or leave blank,  your  font  color  setting
                                   only  applies  to  white text in your input
                                   captions. For example, if your  font  color
                                   setting  is Yellow, and your input captions
                                   have red and white text, your  output  cap-
                                   tions  will  have red and yellow text. When
                                   you choose ALL_TEXT, your font  color  set-
                                   ting applies to all of your output captions
                                   text.

                               BackgroundColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the  rectangle  behind
                                   the captions. Leave background color (Back-
                                   groundColor)   blank    and    set    Style
                                   passthrough  (StylePassthrough)  to enabled
                                   to use the background color data from  your
                                   input captions, if present.

                               BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the opacity of the background rec-
                                   tangle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where
                                   0  is  transparent  and  255  is opaque. If
                                   Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) is set
                                   to enabled, leave blank to pass through the
                                   background style information in your  input
                                   captions  to your output captions. If Style
                                   passthrough is set to disabled, leave blank
                                   to  use  a  value of 0 and remove all back-
                                   grounds from your output captions.

                               FallbackFont -> (string)
                                   Specify the font that you want the  service
                                   to  use for your burn in captions when your
                                   input captions specify a font  that  Media-
                                   Convert doesn't support. When you set Fall-
                                   back  font  (FallbackFont)  to  best  match
                                   (BEST_MATCH),  or leave blank, MediaConvert
                                   uses a supported  font  that  most  closely
                                   matches  the  font that your input captions
                                   specify. When  there  are  multiple  unsup-
                                   ported fonts in your input captions, Media-
                                   Convert matches each  font  with  the  sup-
                                   ported font that matches best. When you ex-
                                   plicitly choose a replacement font,  Media-
                                   Convert  uses  that font to replace all un-
                                   supported fonts from your input.

                               FontColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the burned-in captions
                                   text.  Leave  Font  color (FontColor) blank
                                   and       set       Style       passthrough
                                   (StylePassthrough)  to  enabled  to use the
                                   font color data from your  input  captions,
                                   if present.

                               FontOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  opacity of the burned-in cap-
                                   tions. 255 is opaque; 0 is transparent.

                               FontResolution -> (integer)
                                   Specify the  Font  resolution  (FontResolu-
                                   tion) in DPI (dots per inch).

                               FontScript -> (string)
                                   Set  Font  script (FontScript) to Automati-
                                   cally  determined  (AUTOMATIC),  or   leave
                                   blank,  to automatically determine the font
                                   script in your input  captions.  Otherwise,
                                   set  to Simplified Chinese (HANS) or Tradi-
                                   tional Chinese (HANT) if  your  input  font
                                   script  uses Simplified or Traditional Chi-
                                   nese.

                               FontSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Font size (FontSize) in pixels.
                                   Must  be  a  positive integer. Set to 0, or
                                   leave blank, for automatic font size.

                               HexFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore this setting unless your Font  color
                                   is  set  to  Hex. Enter either six or eight
                                   hexidecimal   digits,   representing   red,
                                   green,  and  blue,  with two optional extra
                                   digits for alpha. For example  a  value  of
                                   1122AABB  is  a  red value of 0x11, a green
                                   value of 0x22, a blue value of 0xAA, and an
                                   alpha value of 0xBB.

                               OutlineColor -> (string)
                                   Specify  font  outline color. Leave Outline
                                   color (OutlineColor) blank  and  set  Style
                                   passthrough  (StylePassthrough)  to enabled
                                   to use the font  outline  color  data  from
                                   your input captions, if present.

                               OutlineSize -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  Outline size (OutlineSize) of
                                   the caption text, in pixels. Leave  Outline
                                   size   blank   and  set  Style  passthrough
                                   (StylePassthrough) to enabled  to  use  the
                                   outline size data from your input captions,
                                   if present.

                               ShadowColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the shadow cast by the
                                   captions.  Leave Shadow color (ShadowColor)
                                   blank    and    set    Style    passthrough
                                   (StylePassthrough)  to  enabled  to use the
                                   shadow color data from your input captions,
                                   if present.

                               ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the opacity of the shadow. Enter a
                                   value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent
                                   and  255  is  opaque.  If Style passthrough
                                   (StylePassthrough) is set to Enabled, leave
                                   Shadow  opacity  (ShadowOpacity)  blank  to
                                   pass through the shadow  style  information
                                   in  your input captions to your output cap-
                                   tions. If Style passthrough is set to  dis-
                                   abled,  leave blank to use a value of 0 and
                                   remove all shadows from  your  output  cap-
                                   tions.

                               ShadowXOffset -> (integer)

                                   shadow, relative to the captions in pixels.
                                   A value of -2 would result in a shadow off-
                                   set 2 pixels to the left.

                               ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                                   Specify the vertical offset of  the  shadow
                                   relative to the captions in pixels. A value
                                   of -2 would result in  a  shadow  offset  2
                                   pixels  above the text. Leave Shadow y-off-
                                   set (ShadowYOffset)  blank  and  set  Style
                                   passthrough  (StylePassthrough)  to enabled
                                   to use the shadow y-offset data  from  your
                                   input captions, if present.

                               StylePassthrough -> (string)
                                   Set Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) to
                                   ENABLED to use the available style,  color,
                                   and  position  information  from your input
                                   captions. MediaConvert  uses  default  set-
                                   tings  for  any  missing style and position
                                   information in  your  input  captions.  Set
                                   Style  passthrough  to  DISABLED,  or leave
                                   blank, to ignore the style and position in-
                                   formation  from your input captions and use
                                   default settings:  white  text  with  black
                                   outlining,  bottom-center  positioning, and
                                   automatic sizing.  Whether  you  set  Style
                                   passthrough to enabled or not, you can also
                                   choose to manually override any of the  in-
                                   dividual style and position settings.

                               TeletextSpacing -> (string)
                                   Specify  whether  the  text  spacing (Tele-
                                   textSpacing) in your captions is set by the
                                   captions  grid, or varies depending on let-
                                   ter width. Choose fixed  grid  (FIXED_GRID)
                                   to  conform to the spacing specified in the
                                   captions file more accurately. Choose  pro-
                                   portional  (PROPORTIONAL)  to make the text
                                   easier to read for closed captions.

                               XPosition -> (integer)
                                   Specify the horizontal position (XPosition)
                                   of  the captions, relative to the left side
                                   of the output in  pixels.  A  value  of  10
                                   would  result  in  the captions starting 10
                                   pixels from the left of the output.  If  no
                                   explicit  x_position is provided, the hori-
                                   zontal caption position will be  determined
                                   by the alignment parameter.

                               YPosition -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  vertical position (YPosition)
                                   of the captions, relative to the top of the
                                   output  in  pixels. A value of 10 would re-
                                   sult in the  captions  starting  10  pixels
                                   from  the top of the output. If no explicit
                                   y_position is provided, the caption will be
                                   positioned  towards  the bottom of the out-
                                   put.

                            DestinationType -> (string)
                               Specify the format for this set of captions  on
                               this  output.  The  default  format is embedded
                               without SCTE-20. Note that your choice of video
                               output container constrains your choice of out-
                               put captions format. For more information,  see
                               https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/captions-support-tables.html.
                               If you are using SCTE-20 and you want to create
                               an  output that complies with the SCTE-43 spec,
                               choose SCTE-20 plus  embedded  (SCTE20_PLUS_EM-
                               BEDDED). To create a non-compliant output where
                               the embedded captions come first, choose Embed-
                               ded plus SCTE-20 (EMBEDDED_PLUS_SCTE20).

                            DvbSubDestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  related  to  DVB-Sub captions. Set up
                               DVB-Sub captions in the  same  output  as  your
                               video.     For     more     information,    see

                               When  you work directly in your JSON job speci-
                               fication, include this object and any  required
                               children   when   you  set  destinationType  to
                               DVB_SUB.

                               Alignment -> (string)
                                   Specify the alignment of your captions.  If
                                   no explicit x_position is provided, setting
                                   alignment to centered  will  placethe  cap-
                                   tions  at  the bottom center of the output.
                                   Similarly,   setting   a   left   alignment
                                   willalign  captions  to  the bottom left of
                                   the output. If x and y positions are  given
                                   in  conjunction  with the alignment parame-
                                   ter, the font  will  be  justified  (either
                                   left or centered) relative to those coordi-
                                   nates. Within your  job  settings,  all  of
                                   your DVB-Sub settings must be identical.

                               ApplyFontColor -> (string)
                                   Ignore    this    setting    unless   Style
                                   Passthrough (StylePassthrough)  is  set  to
                                   Enabled  and  Font color (FontColor) set to
                                   Black, Yellow, Red, Green,  Blue,  or  Hex.
                                   Use  Apply  font color (ApplyFontColor) for
                                   additional font color  controls.  When  you
                                   choose  White  text only (WHITE_TEXT_ONLY),
                                   or leave blank,  your  font  color  setting
                                   only  applies  to  white text in your input
                                   captions. For example, if your  font  color
                                   setting  is Yellow, and your input captions
                                   have red and white text, your  output  cap-
                                   tions  will  have red and yellow text. When
                                   you choose ALL_TEXT, your font  color  set-
                                   ting applies to all of your output captions
                                   text.

                               BackgroundColor -> (string)
                                   Specify the color of the  rectangle  behind
                                   the captions. Leave background color (Back-
                                   groundColor)   blank    and    set    Style
                                   passthrough  (StylePassthrough)  to enabled
                                   to use the background color data from  your
                                   input captions, if present.

                               BackgroundOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the opacity of the background rec-
                                   tangle. Enter a value from 0 to 255,  where
                                   0  is  transparent  and  255  is opaque. If
                                   Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) is set
                                   to enabled, leave blank to pass through the
                                   background style information in your  input
                                   captions  to your output captions. If Style
                                   passthrough is set to disabled, leave blank
                                   to  use  a  value of 0 and remove all back-
                                   grounds from your output  captions.  Within
                                   your job settings, all of your DVB-Sub set-
                                   tings must be identical.

                               DdsHandling -> (string)
                                   Specify how MediaConvert handles  the  dis-
                                   play  definition  segment (DDS). To exclude
                                   the DDS from this set of captions: Keep the
                                   default,  None.  To include the DDS: Choose
                                   Specified. When you do,  also  specify  the
                                   offset  coordinates  of  the display window
                                   with DDS x-coordinate and DDS y-coordinate.
                                   To include the DDS, but not include display
                                   window data: Choose No display window. When
                                   you  do, you can write position metadata to
                                   the page composition segment (PCS) with DDS
                                   x-coordinate   and  DDS  y-coordinate.  For
                                   video resolutions with a height of 576 pix-
                                   els  or  less, MediaConvert doesn't include
                                   the DDS, regardless of the value you choose
                                   for  DDS  handling. All burn-in and DVB-Sub
                                   font settings must match.

                               DdsXCoordinate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting, along with DDS  y-coordi-
                                   nate (ddsYCoordinate), to specify the upper
                                   left corner of the display definition  seg-
                                   ment  (DDS)  display window. With this set-
                                   ting, specify the distance, in pixels,  be-

                                   left side of the DDS display  window.  Keep
                                   the  default value, 0, to have MediaConvert
                                   automatically choose this  offset.  Related
                                   setting:  When  you  use  this setting, you
                                   must set DDS handling  (ddsHandling)  to  a
                                   value  other than None (NONE). MediaConvert
                                   uses these values to determine  whether  to

                                   the page  composition  segment  (PCS).  All
                                   burn-in  and  DVB-Sub  font  settings  must

                               FallbackFont -> (string)
                                   Specify  the font that you want the service
                                   to use for your burn in captions when  your

                                   uses  a  supported  font  that most closely
                                   matches the font that your  input  captions
                                   specify.  When  there  are  multiple unsup-
                                   ported fonts in your input captions, Media-
                                   Convert  matches  each  font  with the sup-
                                   ported font that matches best. When you ex-
                                   plicitly  choose a replacement font, Media-
                                   Convert uses that font to replace  all  un-

                               ShadowOpacity -> (integer)
                                   Specify the opacity of the shadow. Enter  a
                                   value from 0 to 255, where 0 is transparent
                                   and 255 is  opaque.  If  Style  passthrough
                                   (StylePassthrough) is set to Enabled, leave
                                   Shadow  opacity  (ShadowOpacity)  blank  to

                                   Specify   the   horizontal  offset  of  the
                                   shadow, relative to the captions in pixels.
                                   A value of -2 would result in a shadow off-
                                   set 2 pixels to the left. Within  your  job
                                   settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must
                                   be identical.

                               ShadowYOffset -> (integer)
                                   Specify the vertical offset of  the  shadow
                                   relative to the captions in pixels. A value
                                   of -2 would result in  a  shadow  offset  2
                                   pixels  above the text. Leave Shadow y-off-
                                   set (ShadowYOffset)  blank  and  set  Style

                                   to use the shadow y-offset data  from  your
                                   input captions, if present. Within your job
                                   settings, all of your DVB-Sub settings must
                                   be identical.

                               StylePassthrough -> (string)
                                   Set Style passthrough (StylePassthrough) to

                                   information in  your  input  captions.  Set
                                   Style  passthrough  to  DISABLED,  or leave
                                   blank, to ignore the style and position in-

                                   ter  width.  Choose fixed grid (FIXED_GRID)
                                   to conform to the spacing specified in  the
                                   captions  file more accurately. Choose pro-

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  width, in pixels, of this set
                                   of DVB-Sub captions. The default  value  is
                                   720  pixels.  Related setting: When you use
                                   this setting, you  must  set  DDS  handling

                        LanguageCode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  language  of  this  captions  output
                            track.  For  most captions output formats, the en-
                            coder puts this language information in the output
                            captions  metadata. If your output captions format
                            is DVB-Sub or Burn in, the encoder uses this  lan-
                            guage  information to choose the font language for
                            rendering the captions text.

                        LanguageDescription -> (string)
                            Specify a label for this set of  output  captions.
                            For  example, "English", "Director commentary", or
                            "track_2".  For  streaming  outputs,  MediaConvert
                            passes this information into destination manifests
                            for display on the end-viewer's player device. For
                            outputs  in  other  output groups, the service ig-
                            nores this setting.

                 ContainerSettings -> (structure)
                     Container specific settings.

                     CmfcSettings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to the fragmented MP4  container
                        for the segments in your CMAF outputs.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is  sensitive  to  very small duration differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                            TION). In all other cases, keep the default value,
                            Default  codec  duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads  the  output  audio  streams  with silence or
                            trims them to ensure that the  total  duration  of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration of the video  stream.  After  padding  or
                            trimming,  the  audio  stream  duration is no more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only
                            to the end of the file. When you keep the  default
                            value,  any  minor discrepancies between audio and
                            video duration will depend on  your  output  audio
                            codec.

                        AudioGroupId -> (string)
                            Specify  the  audio rendition group for this audio
                            rendition. Specify up to one value for each  audio
                            output in your output group. This value appears in
                            your HLS parent manifest in the EXT-X-MEDIA tag of
                            TYPE=AUDIO,  as  the value for the GROUP-ID attri-
                            bute. For example, if  you  specify  "audio_aac_1"
                            for  Audio  group  ID, it appears in your manifest
                            like  this:  #EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=AUDIO,GROUP-ID="au-
                            dio_aac_1". Related setting: To associate the ren-
                            dition group that this audio track belongs to with
                            a video rendition, include the same value that you
                            provide here for that video output's setting Audio
                            rendition sets (audioRenditionSets).

                        AudioRenditionSets -> (string)
                            List  the audio rendition groups that you want in-
                            cluded with this video rendition. Use a comma-sep-
                            arated  list. For example, say you want to include
                            the audio rendition groups  that  have  the  audio
                            group  IDs  "audio_aac_1"  and "audio_dolby". Then
                            you would  specify  this  value:  "audio_aac_1,au-
                            dio_dolby".  Related setting: The rendition groups
                            that you  include  in  your  comma-separated  list
                            should  all  match  values that you specify in the
                            setting Audio group ID  (AudioGroupId)  for  audio
                            renditions  in the same output group as this video
                            rendition. Default behavior: If you don't  specify
                            anything here and for Audio group ID, MediaConvert
                            puts each audio variant in its own audio rendition
                            group  and associates it with every video variant.
                            Each value in your list appears in your HLS parent
                            manifest  in the EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag as the value
                            for the AUDIO attribute. To continue the  previous
                            example, say that the file name for the child man-
                            ifest  for  your   video   rendition   is   "amaz-
                            ing_video_1.m3u8".  Then, in your parent manifest,
                            each value will appear  on  separate  lines,  like
                            this:     #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="audio_aac_1"...
                            amazing_video_1.m3u8  #EXT-X-STREAM-INF:AUDIO="au-
                            dio_dolby"... amazing_video_1.m3u8

                        AudioTrackType -> (string)
                            Use this setting to control the values that Media-
                            Convert puts in your HLS parent playlist  to  con-
                            trol  how  the  client  player selects which audio
                            track to play. The other options for this  setting
                            determine  the values that MediaConvert writes for
                            the  DEFAULT  and  AUTOSELECT  attributes  of  the
                            EXT-X-MEDIA  entry for the audio variant. For more
                            information about these attributes, see the  Apple
                            documentation                              article
                            https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/example_playlists_for_http_live_streaming/adding_alternate_media_to_a_playlist.
                            Choose  Alternate audio, auto select, default (AL-
                            TERNATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT_DEFAULT)  to   set   DE-
                            FAULT=YES  and  AUTOSELECT=YES.  Choose this value
                            for only one variant in your output group.  Choose
                            Alternate  audio, auto select, not default (ALTER-
                            NATE_AUDIO_AUTO_SELECT) to set DEFAULT=NO and  AU-
                            TOSELECT=YES. Choose Alternate Audio, Not Auto Se-
                            lect to set DEFAULT=NO and AUTOSELECT=NO. When you
                            don't  specify a value for this setting, MediaCon-
                            vert defaults to Alternate audio, auto select, de-
                            fault. When there is more than one variant in your
                            output group, you must explicitly choose  a  value
                            for this setting.

                        DescriptiveVideoServiceFlag -> (string)
                            Specify  whether  to  flag this audio track as de-
                            scriptive video service (DVS) in your  HLS  parent
                            manifest.  When  you choose Flag (FLAG), MediaCon-
                            vert includes the parameter  CHARACTERISTICS="pub-
                            lic.accessibility.describes-video"      in     the
                            EXT-X-MEDIA entry for this track.  When  you  keep
                            the default choice, Don't flag (DONT_FLAG), Media-
                            Convert leaves this parameter out.  The  DVS  flag
                            can  help with accessibility on Apple devices. For
                            more information, see the Apple documentation.

                        IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                            Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have MediaConvert gen-
                            erate  an  HLS  child manifest that lists only the
                            I-frames for this rendition, in addition  to  your
                            regular manifest for this rendition. You might use
                            this manifest as part of a workflow  that  creates
                            preview  functions  for  your  video. MediaConvert
                            adds both the I-frame only child manifest and  the
                            regular  child  manifest  to  the parent manifest.
                            When you don't need the I-frame only  child  mani-
                            fest, keep the default value Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include key-length-value metadata in this out-
                            put: Set KLV metadata  insertion  to  Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert  reads  KLV  metadata present in your
                            input and writes each instance to a separate event
                            message  box  in  the  output,  according  to MISB
                            ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV  metadata:  Set  KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                            To add an InbandEventStream element in your output
                            MPD manifest for each type of event  message,  set
                            Manifest  metadata  signaling  to Enabled. For ID3
                            event  messages,  the  InbandEventStream   element
                            schemeIdUri  will  be  same value that you specify
                            for ID3 metadata scheme ID URI. For  SCTE35  event
                            messages,  the  InbandEventStream element schemeI-
                            dUri will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To  leave
                            these  elements  out  of your output MPD manifest,
                            set Manifest metadata signaling  to  Disabled.  To
                            enable  Manifest metadata signaling, you must also
                            set SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to
                            insert,   or   ID3   metadata  (TimedMetadata)  to
                            Passthrough.

                        Scte35Esam -> (string)
                            Use this setting only  when  you  specify  SCTE-35
                            markers  from  ESAM.  Choose INSERT to put SCTE-35
                            markers in this output  at  the  insertion  points
                            that  you specify in an ESAM XML document. Provide
                            the document in the setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless you have SCTE-35  mark-
                            ers  in  your input video file. Choose Passthrough
                            (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35 markers that ap-
                            pear  in your input to also appear in this output.
                            Choose None (NONE) if you don't want those SCTE-35
                            markers in this output.

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include  ID3  metadata in this output: Set ID3
                            metadata    (timedMetadata)     to     Passthrough
                            (PASSTHROUGH). Specify this ID3 metadata in Custom
                            ID3  metadata  inserter  (timedMetadataInsertion).
                            MediaConvert  writes each instance of ID3 metadata
                            in a separate Event Message (eMSG) box. To exclude
                            this ID3 metadata: Set ID3 metadata to None (NONE)
                            or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG)  version  for
                            ID3 timed metadata in your output. For more infor-

                        TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                            Specify the event message box (eMSG) scheme ID URI
                            (scheme_id_uri)  for  ID3  timed  metadata in your

                            Specify the event message box (eMSG) value for ID3
                            timed  metadata  in your output. For more informa-
                            tion, see ISO/IEC 23009-1:2022 section  5.10.3.3.4
                            Semantics.  When you specify a value for ID3 Meta-
                            data Value, you must also set ID3 metadata (timed-
                            Metadata) to Passthrough.

                     Container -> (string)
                        Container  for  this output. Some containers require a
                        container settings object. If not specified,  the  de-
                        fault object will be created.

                     F4vSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings for F4v container

                        MoovPlacement -> (string)
                            If  set  to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV atom is
                            relocated to the beginning of the archive  as  re-
                            quired  for  progressive downloading. Otherwise it
                            is placed normally at the end.

                     M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                        MPEG-2 TS container settings. These apply  to  outputs
                        in  a  File  output  group when the output's container
                        (ContainerType) is MPEG-2 Transport Stream (M2TS).  In
                        these assets, data is organized by the program map ta-
                        ble (PMT). Each transport stream program contains sub-
                        sets  of  data,  including audio, video, and metadata.
                        Each of these subsets of data has  a  numerical  label
                        called  a  packet  identifier  (PID).  Each  transport
                        stream program corresponds to one MediaConvert output.
                        The  PMT  lists  the  types of data in a program along
                        with their PID. Downstream systems and players use the
                        program  map table to look up the PID for each type of
                        data it accesses and then uses the PIDs to locate spe-
                        cific data within the asset.

                        AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                            Selects between the DVB and ATSC buffer models for
                            Dolby Digital audio.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                            TION). In all other cases, keep the default value,
                            Default codec  duration  (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads the output  audio  streams  with  silence  or
                            trims  them  to  ensure that the total duration of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration  of  the  video  stream. After padding or
                            trimming, the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                            to  the end of the file. When you keep the default
                            value, any minor discrepancies between  audio  and
                            video  duration  will  depend on your output audio
                            codec.

                        AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                            The number of audio frames to insert for each  PES
                            packet.

                        AudioPids -> (list)
                            Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for any ele-
                            mentary audio streams you include in this  output.
                            Specify  multiple PIDs as a JSON array. Default is
                            the range 482-492.

                            (integer)

                        Bitrate -> (integer)
                            Specify the output bitrate of the transport stream
                            in  bits  per  second. Setting to 0 lets the muxer
                            automatically determine the  appropriate  bitrate.
                            Other  common  values  are  3750000,  7500000, and
                            15000000.

                        BufferModel -> (string)
                            Controls what buffer model to use for accurate in-
                            terleaving.  If  set  to  MULTIPLEX, use multiplex
                            buffer model. If set to NONE,  this  can  lead  to
                            lower  latency,  but low-memory devices may not be
                            able to play back  the  stream  without  interrup-
                            tions.

                        DataPTSControl -> (string)
                            If  you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes
                            captions and data packets with Presentation  Time-
                            stamp  (PTS)  values  greater than or equal to the
                            first video packet PTS  (MediaConvert  drops  cap-
                            tions  and  data  packets with lesser PTS values).
                            Keep the default value (AUTO)  to  allow  all  PTS
                            values.

                        DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                            Use  these settings to insert a DVB Network Infor-
                            mation Table (NIT) in the transport stream of this
                            output.  When  you  work directly in your JSON job
                            specification, include this object only when  your
                            job  has  a  transport  stream output and the con-
                            tainer settings contain the object M2tsSettings.

                            NetworkId -> (integer)

                               The  network  name  text  placed  in  the  net-
                               work_name_descriptor inside the Network  Infor-
                               mation Table. Maximum length is 256 characters.

                            NitInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                        DvbSdtSettings -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to insert  a  DVB  Service  De-
                            scription  Table  (SDT) in the transport stream of
                            this output. When you work directly in  your  JSON
                            job  specification,  include this object only when
                            your job has a transport  stream  output  and  the
                            container  settings  contain  the  object M2tsSet-
                            tings.

                            OutputSdt -> (string)
                               Selects method  of  inserting  SDT  information
                               into  output  stream. "Follow input SDT" copies
                               SDT information from  input  stream  to  output
                               stream.  "Follow  input  SDT if present" copies
                               SDT information from  input  stream  to  output
                               stream if SDT information is present in the in-
                               put,  otherwise  it  will  fall  back  on   the
                               user-defined values. Enter "SDT Manually" means
                               user will enter the SDT information.  "No  SDT"
                               means output stream will not contain SDT infor-
                               mation.

                            SdtInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                            ServiceName -> (string)
                               The service name placed in the service_descrip-
                               tor in the Service Description  Table.  Maximum
                               length is 256 characters.

                            ServiceProviderName -> (string)
                               The  service  provider  name placed in the ser-
                               vice_descriptor in the Service Description  Ta-
                               ble. Maximum length is 256 characters.

                        DvbSubPids -> (list)
                            Specify the packet identifiers (PIDs) for DVB sub-
                            title data included in this output. Specify multi-
                            ple  PIDs  as  a  JSON array. Default is the range
                            460-479.

                            (integer)

                        DvbTdtSettings -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to insert a DVB Time  and  Date
                            Table  (TDT)  in the transport stream of this out-
                            put. When you work directly in your JSON job spec-
                            ification,  include this object only when your job
                            has a transport stream output  and  the  container
                            settings contain the object M2tsSettings.

                            TdtInterval -> (integer)
                               The number of milliseconds between instances of
                               this table in the output transport stream.

                        DvbTeletextPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) for DVB  tele-
                            text  data  you include in this output. Default is
                            499.

                        EbpAudioInterval -> (string)
                            When set to VIDEO_AND_FIXED_INTERVALS,  audio  EBP
                            markers  will  be added to partitions 3 and 4. The
                            interval between these additional markers will  be
                            fixed, and will be slightly shorter than the video
                            EBP marker interval. When set  to  VIDEO_INTERVAL,
                            these  additional  markers  will  not be inserted.
                            Only applicable when EBP segmentation markers  are
                            is   selected   (segmentationMarkers   is  EBP  or
                            EBP_LEGACY).

                        EbpPlacement -> (string)
                            Selects which PIDs to place EBP markers  on.  They
                            can  either be placed only on the video PID, or on
                            both the video PID and all audio PIDs. Only appli-
                            cable  when  EBP  segmentation  markers are is se-
                            lected (segmentationMarkers is EBP or EBP_LEGACY).

                        EsRateInPes -> (string)
                            Controls whether to include the ES Rate  field  in
                            the PES header.

                        ForceTsVideoEbpOrder -> (string)
                            Keep  the  default value (DEFAULT) unless you know
                            that your audio EBP markers  are  incorrectly  ap-
                            pearing  before your video EBP markers. To correct
                            this problem, set this value to Force (FORCE).

                        FragmentTime -> (double)
                            The length, in seconds,  of  each  fragment.  Only
                            used with EBP markers.

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To  include key-length-value metadata in this out-
                            put: Set KLV metadata  insertion  to  Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert  reads  KLV  metadata present in your
                            input and passes it through to the  output  trans-
                            port stream. To exclude this KLV metadata: Set KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum time, in milliseconds, between
                            Program  Clock References (PCRs) inserted into the
                            transport stream.

                        MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                            When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary Points do
                            not  come  within  the  specified time interval of
                            each other by looking ahead at input video. If an-
                            other EBP is going to come in within the specified
                            time interval, the current EBP is not emitted, and
                            the segment is "stretched" to the next marker. The
                            lookahead value does not add latency to  the  sys-
                            tem.  The  Live Event must be configured elsewhere
                            to create sufficient latency to make the lookahead
                            accurate.

                        NielsenId3 -> (string)
                            If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones  for  media
                            tracking will be detected in the input  audio  and
                            an equivalent ID3 tag will be inserted in the out-
                            put.

                        NullPacketBitrate -> (double)
                            Value in bits per second of extra null packets  to
                            insert into the transport stream. This can be used
                            if a downstream encryption system  requires  peri-
                            odic null packets.

                        PatInterval -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  milliseconds between instances of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PcrControl -> (string)
                            When set to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET, a Program  Clock
                            Reference  value  is inserted for every Packetized
                            Elementary Stream (PES) header. This is  effective
                            only  when the PCR PID is the same as the video or
                            audio elementary stream.

                        PcrPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) for  the  pro-
                            gram  clock reference (PCR) in this output. If you
                            do not specify a value, the service will  use  the
                            value for Video PID (VideoPid).

                        PmtInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  number  of  milliseconds between in-
                            stances of the program map table (PMT) in the out-
                            put transport stream.

                        PmtPid -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) for the pro-
                            gram map table (PMT) itself. Default is 480.

                        PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the private
                            metadata stream. Default is 503.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Use  Program number (programNumber) to specify the
                            program number used in the program map table (PMT)
                            for this output. Default is 1. Program numbers and
                            program map tables are parts of  MPEG-2  transport
                            stream containers, used for organizing data.

                        RateMode -> (string)
                            When  set to CBR, inserts null packets into trans-
                            port stream to fill specified bitrate. When set to
                            VBR,  the  bitrate setting acts as the maximum bi-
                            trate, but the output will not  be  padded  up  to
                            that bitrate.

                        Scte35Esam -> (structure)
                            Include  this  in your job settings to put SCTE-35
                            markers in your HLS and transport  stream  outputs
                            at  the  insertion  points  that you specify in an
                            ESAM XML document. Provide  the  document  in  the
                            setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                            Scte35EsamPid -> (integer)
                               Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the SCTE-35 stream
                               in the transport stream generated by ESAM.

                        Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35
                            stream in the transport stream.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            For  SCTE-35  markers  from  your  input--  Choose
                            Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)  if  you  want  SCTE-35
                            markers  that  appear in your input to also appear
                            in this output. Choose None (NONE)  if  you  don't
                            want  SCTE-35  markers in this output. For SCTE-35
                            markers from an ESAM XML  document--  Choose  None
                            (NONE).  Also  provide the ESAM XML as a string in
                            the setting  Signal  processing  notification  XML
                            (sccXml).  Also  enable  ESAM SCTE-35 (include the
                            property scte35Esam).

                        SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                            Inserts segmentation  markers  at  each  segmenta-
                            tion_time period. rai_segstart sets the Random Ac-
                            cess  Indicator  bit  in  the  adaptation   field.
                            rai_adapt  sets  the  RAI bit and adds the current
                            timecode in the private data  bytes.  psi_segstart
                            inserts  PAT  and  PMT tables at the start of seg-
                            ments. ebp adds Encoder Boundary Point information
                            to  the adaptation field as per OpenCable specifi-
                            cation OC-SP-EBP-I01-130118. ebp_legacy  adds  En-
                            coder Boundary Point information to the adaptation
                            field using a legacy proprietary format.

                        SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                            The segmentation style parameter controls how seg-
                            mentation  markers are inserted into the transport
                            stream. With avails, it is possible that  segments
                            may be truncated, which can influence where future
                            segmentation markers are inserted. When a  segmen-
                            tation  style of "reset_cadence" is selected and a
                            segment is truncated due to an avail, we will  re-
                            set  the segmentation cadence. This means the sub-
                            sequent segment will have a duration of  of  $seg-
                            mentation_time  seconds. When a segmentation style
                            of "maintain_cadence" is selected and a segment is
                            truncated  due  to an avail, we will not reset the
                            segmentation cadence. This  means  the  subsequent
                            segment will likely be truncated as well. However,
                            all segments after that will have  a  duration  of
                            $segmentation_time  seconds.  Note  that EBP look-
                            ahead is a slight exception to this rule.

                        SegmentationTime -> (double)
                            Specify the length, in seconds, of  each  segment.
                            Required unless markers is set to _none_.

                        TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream
                            in the transport stream.

                        TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                            Specify the ID for the transport stream itself  in
                            the  program  map table for this output. Transport
                            stream IDs and program map  tables  are  parts  of
                            MPEG-2 transport stream containers, used for orga-
                            nizing data.

                        VideoPid -> (integer)
                            Specify the packet identifier (PID) of the elemen-
                            tary video stream in the transport stream.

                     M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                        These  settings  relate to the MPEG-2 transport stream
                        (MPEG2-TS) container for the MPEG2-TS segments in your
                        HLS outputs.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is  sensitive  to  very small duration differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                            TION). In all other cases, keep the default value,
                            Default  codec  duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads  the  output  audio  streams  with silence or
                            trims them to ensure that the  total  duration  of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration of the video  stream.  After  padding  or
                            trimming,  the  audio  stream  duration is no more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented  outputs, MediaConvert adds padding only
                            to the end of the file. When you keep the  default
                            value,  any  minor discrepancies between audio and
                            video duration will depend on  your  output  audio
                            codec.

                        AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                            The  number of audio frames to insert for each PES
                            packet.

                        AudioPids -> (list)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  elementary  audio
                            stream(s) in the transport stream. Multiple values
                            are accepted, and can be entered in ranges  and/or
                            by comma separation.

                            (integer)

                        DataPTSControl -> (string)
                            If  you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaConvert writes
                            captions and data packets with Presentation  Time-
                            stamp  (PTS)  values  greater than or equal to the
                            first video packet PTS  (MediaConvert  drops  cap-
                            tions  and  data  packets with lesser PTS values).
                            Keep the default value (AUTO)  to  allow  all  PTS
                            values.

                        MaxPcrInterval -> (integer)
                            Specify the maximum time, in milliseconds, between
                            Program Clock References (PCRs) inserted into  the
                            transport stream.

                        NielsenId3 -> (string)
                            If  INSERT,  Nielsen  inaudible  tones  for  media
                            tracking will be detected in the input  audio  and
                            an equivalent ID3 tag will be inserted in the out-
                            put.

                        PatInterval -> (integer)
                            The number of milliseconds  between  instances  of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PcrControl -> (string)
                            When  set  to PCR_EVERY_PES_PACKET a Program Clock
                            Reference value is inserted for  every  Packetized
                            Elementary  Stream (PES) header. This parameter is
                            effective only when the PCR PID is the same as the
                            video or audio elementary stream.

                        PcrPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier (PID) of the Program Clock Ref-
                            erence (PCR) in  the  transport  stream.  When  no
                            value  is  given, the encoder will assign the same
                            value as the Video PID.

                        PmtInterval -> (integer)
                            The number of milliseconds  between  instances  of
                            this table in the output transport stream.

                        PmtPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier (PID) for the Program Map Table
                            (PMT) in the transport stream.

                        PrivateMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  private  metadata
                            stream in the transport stream.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            The  value of the program number field in the Pro-
                            gram Map Table.

                        Scte35Pid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the SCTE-35  stream  in
                            the transport stream.

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            For  SCTE-35  markers  from  your  input--  Choose
                            Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)  if  you  want  SCTE-35
                            markers  that  appear in your input to also appear
                            in this output. Choose None (NONE)  if  you  don't
                            want  SCTE-35  markers in this output. For SCTE-35
                            markers from an ESAM XML  document--  Choose  None
                            (NONE)  if  you  don't want manifest conditioning.
                            Choose Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)  and  choose  Ad
                            markers (adMarkers) if you do want manifest condi-
                            tioning. In both cases, also provide the ESAM  XML
                            as a string in the setting Signal processing noti-
                            fication XML (sccXml).

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            Set ID3 metadata  (timedMetadata)  to  Passthrough
                            (PASSTHROUGH) to include ID3 metadata in this out-
                            put. This includes ID3 metadata from the following
                            features:   ID3   timestamp   period   (timedMeta-
                            dataId3Period), and Custom ID3  metadata  inserter
                            (timedMetadataInsertion).   To  exclude  this  ID3
                            metadata in this output: set ID3 metadata to  None
                            (NONE) or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                            Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 metadata stream
                            in the transport stream.

                        TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                            The value of the transport stream ID field in  the
                            Program Map Table.

                        VideoPid -> (integer)
                            Packet  Identifier  (PID)  of the elementary video
                            stream in the transport stream.

                     MovSettings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to  your  QuickTime  MOV  output
                        container.

                        ClapAtom -> (string)
                            When  enabled,  include 'clap' atom if appropriate
                            for the video output settings.

                        CslgAtom -> (string)
                            When enabled, file composition times will start at
                            zero, composition times in the 'ctts' (composition
                            time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative,
                            and  a  'cslg'  (composition shift least greatest)
                            box will be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                            improves  compatibility  with  Apple  players  and
                            tools.

                        Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                            When set to XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video streams into
                            the  QuickTime file using XDCAM fourcc codes. This
                            increases compatibility  with  Apple  editors  and
                            players, but may decrease compatibility with other
                            players. Only applicable when the video  codec  is
                            MPEG2.

                        PaddingControl -> (string)
                            Unless you need Omneon compatibility: Keep the de-
                            fault value, None. To make this output  compatible
                            with Omneon: Choose Omneon. When you do, MediaCon-
                            vert increases the length of the 'elst' edit  list
                            atom.  Note  that this might cause file rejections
                            when a recipient of the output file doesn't expect
                            this extra padding.

                        Reference -> (string)
                            Always keep the default value (SELF_CONTAINED) for
                            this setting.

                     Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                        These settings relate to your  MP4  output  container.
                        You can create audio only outputs with this container.
                        For          more           information,           see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/supported-codecs-containers-audio-only.html#output-codecs-and-containers-supported-for-audio-only.

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                            TION). In all other cases, keep the default value,
                            Default codec  duration  (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads the output  audio  streams  with  silence  or
                            trims  them  to  ensure that the total duration of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration  of  the  video  stream. After padding or
                            trimming, the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                            to  the end of the file. When you keep the default
                            value, any minor discrepancies between  audio  and
                            video  duration  will  depend on your output audio
                            codec.

                        CslgAtom -> (string)
                            When enabled, file composition times will start at
                            zero, composition times in the 'ctts' (composition
                            time to sample) box for B-frames will be negative,
                            and  a  'cslg'  (composition shift least greatest)
                            box will be included per 14496-1 amendment 1. This
                            improves  compatibility  with  Apple  players  and
                            tools.

                        CttsVersion -> (integer)
                            Ignore this setting unless compliance to the  CTTS
                            box  version  specification  matters in your work-
                            flow. Specify a value of 1 to set  your  CTTS  box
                            version  to  1 and make your output compliant with
                            the specification. When you specify a value of  1,
                            you  must  also  set  CSLG  atom (cslgAtom) to the
                            value INCLUDE. Keep the default  value  0  to  set
                            your CTTS box version to 0. This can provide back-
                            ward compatibility for some players and packagers.

                        FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                            Inserts a free-space  box  immediately  after  the
                            moov box.

                        MoovPlacement -> (string)
                            If  set  to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV atom is
                            relocated to the beginning of the archive  as  re-
                            quired  for  progressive downloading. Otherwise it
                            is placed normally at the end.

                        Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                            Overrides the "Major Brand" field  in  the  output
                            file. Usually not necessary to specify.

                     MpdSettings -> (structure)
                        These  settings relate to the fragmented MP4 container
                        for the segments in your DASH outputs.

                        AccessibilityCaptionHints -> (string)
                            Optional. Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have  Media-
                            Convert  mark  up your DASH manifest with elements
                            for embedded 608 captions. This markup isn't  gen-
                            erally required, but some video players require it
                            to discover and play embedded 608  captions.  Keep
                            the  default  value,  Exclude  (EXCLUDE), to leave
                            these elements out. When you enable this  setting,
                            this  is  the markup that MediaConvert includes in
                            your manifest:

                        AudioDuration -> (string)
                            Specify this setting only when your output will be
                            consumed by a downstream repackaging workflow that
                            is sensitive to very  small  duration  differences
                            between  video  and  audio.  For  this  situation,
                            choose  Match  video  duration  (MATCH_VIDEO_DURA-
                            TION). In all other cases, keep the default value,
                            Default codec  duration  (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                            When you choose Match video duration, MediaConvert
                            pads the output  audio  streams  with  silence  or
                            trims  them  to  ensure that the total duration of
                            each audio stream is at least as long as the total
                            duration  of  the  video  stream. After padding or
                            trimming, the audio stream  duration  is  no  more
                            than one frame longer than the video stream. Medi-
                            aConvert applies audio padding or trimming only to
                            the end of the last segment of the output. For un-
                            segmented outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                            to  the end of the file. When you keep the default
                            value, any minor discrepancies between  audio  and
                            video  duration  will  depend on your output audio
                            codec.

                        CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                            Use this setting only in DASH output  groups  that
                            include sidecar TTML or IMSC captions. You specify
                            sidecar captions in a separate  output  from  your
                            audio  and video. Choose Raw (RAW) for captions in
                            a single XML file in a raw container. Choose Frag-
                            mented MPEG-4 (FRAGMENTED_MP4) for captions in XML
                            format contained within fragmented MP4 files. This
                            set  of fragmented MP4 files is separate from your
                            video and audio fragmented MP4 files.

                        KlvMetadata -> (string)
                            To include key-length-value metadata in this  out-
                            put:  Set  KLV  metadata insertion to Passthrough.
                            MediaConvert reads KLV metadata  present  in  your
                            input and writes each instance to a separate event
                            message box  in  the  output,  according  to  MISB
                            ST1910.1.  To  exclude  this KLV metadata: Set KLV
                            metadata insertion to None or leave blank.

                        ManifestMetadataSignaling -> (string)
                            To add an InbandEventStream element in your output
                            MPD  manifest  for each type of event message, set
                            Manifest metadata signaling to  Enabled.  For  ID3
                            event   messages,  the  InbandEventStream  element
                            schemeIdUri will be same value  that  you  specify
                            for  ID3  metadata scheme ID URI. For SCTE35 event
                            messages, the InbandEventStream  element  schemeI-
                            dUri  will be "urn:scte:scte35:2013:bin". To leave
                            these elements out of your  output  MPD  manifest,
                            set  Manifest  metadata  signaling to Disabled. To
                            enable Manifest metadata signaling, you must  also
                            set SCTE-35 source to Passthrough, ESAM SCTE-35 to
                            insert,  or  ID3   metadata   (TimedMetadata)   to
                            Passthrough.

                        Scte35Esam -> (string)
                            Use  this  setting  only  when you specify SCTE-35
                            markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT  to  put  SCTE-35
                            markers  in  this  output  at the insertion points
                            that you specify in an ESAM XML document.  Provide
                            the document in the setting SCC XML (sccXml).

                        Scte35Source -> (string)
                            Ignore  this setting unless you have SCTE-35 mark-
                            ers in your input video file.  Choose  Passthrough
                            (PASSTHROUGH) if you want SCTE-35 markers that ap-
                            pear in your input to also appear in this  output.
                            Choose None (NONE) if you don't want those SCTE-35
                            markers in this output.

                        TimedMetadata -> (string)
                            To include ID3 metadata in this  output:  Set  ID3
                            metadata     (timedMetadata)     to    Passthrough
                            (PASSTHROUGH). Specify this ID3 metadata in Custom
                            ID3  metadata  inserter  (timedMetadataInsertion).
                            MediaConvert writes each instance of ID3  metadata
                            in a separate Event Message (eMSG) box. To exclude
                            this ID3 metadata: Set ID3 metadata to None (NONE)
                            or leave blank.

                        TimedMetadataBoxVersion -> (string)
                            Specify  the  event message box (eMSG) version for
                            ID3 timed metadata in your output. For more infor-
                            mation,    see    ISO/IEC   23009-1:2022   section
                            5.10.3.3.3 Syntax. Leave blank to use the  default
                            value  Version  0. When you specify Version 1, you
                            must also  set  ID3  metadata  (timedMetadata)  to
                            Passthrough.

                        TimedMetadataSchemeIdUri -> (string)

                        These settings relate to your MXF output container.

                        AfdSignaling -> (string)
                            Optional. When you have AFD signaling  set  up  in
                            your  output  video  stream,  use  this setting to
                            choose whether to also include it in the MXF wrap-
                            per.  Choose  Don't  copy (NO_COPY) to exclude AFD
                            signaling from the MXF wrapper. Choose  Copy  from
                            video  stream  (COPY_FROM_VIDEO)  to  copy the AFD
                            values from the video stream for  this  output  to
                            the  MXF  wrapper.  Regardless of which option you
                            choose, the AFD values remain in the video stream.

                            when you set your MXF profile to XAVC.

                            DurationMode -> (string)
                               To create an output that complies with the XAVC
                               file  format  guidelines  for interoperability,

                               teletext  captions.  The default value for this
                               setting is 1492 bytes per frame. This should be
                               sufficient  to prevent overflow unless you have
                               multiple pages of teletext  captions  data.  If
                               you have a large amount of teletext data, spec-
                               ify a larger number.

                 VideoDescription -> (structure)
                     VideoDescription contains a group of video encoding  set-
                     tings.  The  specific  video settings depend on the video
                     codec that you choose for the property codec. Include one
                     instance of VideoDescription per output.

                     AfdSignaling -> (string)
                        This  setting  only applies to H.264, H.265, and MPEG2
                        outputs. Use Insert AFD  signaling  (AfdSignaling)  to
                        specify whether the service includes AFD values in the
                        output video data and what those values are. *  Choose
                        None  to  remove  all  AFD  values from this output. *
                        Choose Fixed to ignore input AFD  values  and  instead
                        encode  the  value specified in the job. * Choose Auto
                        to calculate output AFD values based on the input  AFD
                        scaler data.

                     AntiAlias -> (string)
                        The  anti-alias filter is automatically applied to all
                        outputs. The service no longer accepts the value  DIS-
                        ABLED  for AntiAlias. If you specify that in your job,
                        the service will ignore the setting.

                     CodecSettings -> (structure)
                        Video codec settings, (CodecSettings) under  (VideoDe-
                        scription),  contains the group of settings related to
                        video encoding. The settings in this  group  vary  de-
                        pending  on  the value that you choose for Video codec
                        (Codec). For each codec enum that you  choose,  define
                        the corresponding settings object. The following lists
                        the codec enum, settings object pairs. * AV1,  Av1Set-

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Specify the strength of any adaptive  quantiza-
                               tion  filters  that  you enable. The value that
                               you choose here  applies  to  Spatial  adaptive
                               quantization (spatialAdaptiveQuantization).

                            BitDepth -> (string)
                               Specify  the  Bit  depth (Av1BitDepth). You can
                               choose 8-bit (BIT_8) or 10-bit (BIT_10).

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as   a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating  your
                               transcoding job specification as  a  JSON  file
                               without  the  console,  use FramerateControl to
                               specify which value the service  uses  for  the
                               frame  rate  for  this  output. Choose INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to  use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if you want the service to use the  frame  rate
                               you  specify in the settings FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP)  for numerically simple conversions,
                               such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically  com-
                               plex  conversions, you can use interpolate (IN-
                               TERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in  a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions,  especially if your source video has al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best  conversion  method  frame  by frame. Note
                               that using FrameFormer increases the  transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Specify  the  GOP length (keyframe interval) in
                               frames. With AV1, MediaConvert doesn't  support
                               GOP  length  in  seconds.  This  value  must be
                               greater than zero and preferably equal to  1  +
                               ((numberBFrames  + 1) * x), where x is an inte-
                               ger value.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify from the number  of  B-frames,  in  the
                               range  of  0-15. For AV1 encoding, we recommend
                               using 7 or 15. Choose a  larger  number  for  a
                               lower  bitrate  and smaller file size; choose a
                               smaller number for better video quality.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings for quality-defined  variable  bitrate
                               encoding  with  the H.265 codec. Use these set-
                               tings only when you set QVBR for  Rate  control
                               mode (RateControlMode).

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control  mode  (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.
                                   Specify  the  target quality level for this
                                   output. MediaConvert determines  the  right
                                   number  of bits to use for each part of the
                                   video to maintain the  video  quality  that
                                   you  specify.  When  you  keep  the default
                                   value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks  a  quality
                                   level  for you, based on characteristics of
                                   your input video. If you prefer to  specify
                                   a  quality  level,  specify a number from 1
                                   through 10. Use higher numbers for  greater
                                   quality.  Level  10 results in nearly loss-
                                   less compression.  The  quality  level  for
                                   most  broadcast-quality  transcodes  is be-
                                   tween 6 and 9.  Optionally,  to  specify  a
                                   value between whole numbers, also provide a
                                   value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune.  For  example,  if you want your QVBR
                                   quality level to  be  7.33,  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional. Specify a value here to  set  the
                                   QVBR  quality  to  a  level that is between
                                   whole numbers. For  example,  if  you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est  third  of a whole number. For example,
                                   if you set qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  you
                                   set  qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25, your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               'With AV1 outputs, for rate control mode, Medi-
                               aConvert supports only quality-defined variable
                               bitrate (QVBR). You can''t use CBR or VBR.'

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Specify the number of slices per picture.  This
                               value  must  be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32. For pro-
                               gressive pictures, this value must be less than
                               or  equal to the number of macroblock rows. For
                               interlaced pictures, this value  must  be  less
                               than  or equal to half the number of macroblock
                               rows.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the default value, Enabled  (ENABLED),  to
                               adjust  quantization within each frame based on
                               spatial variation of content  complexity.  When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits on areas that can sustain more  distortion
                               with  no noticeable visual degradation and uses
                               more bits on areas where any  small  distortion
                               will  be  noticeable. For example, complex tex-
                               tured blocks are encoded with  fewer  bits  and
                               smooth  textured  blocks  are encoded with more
                               bits. Enabling this feature will almost  always
                               improve  your video quality. Note, though, that
                               this feature doesn't take  into  account  where
                               the  viewer's  attention  is  likely  to be. If
                               viewers are likely to be focusing their  atten-
                               tion on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                               plex texture, you might choose to disable  this
                               feature.  Related setting: When you enable spa-
                               tial adaptive quantization, set the  value  for
                               Adaptive   quantization  (adaptiveQuantization)
                               depending on your content. For homogeneous con-
                               tent,  such as cartoons and video games, set it
                               to Low. For content with  a  wider  variety  of
                               textures, set it to High or Higher.

                        AvcIntraSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you choose AVC-Intra for your output
                            video  codec.  For  more  information  about   the
                            AVC-Intra  settings,  see  the relevant specifica-
                            tion. For detailed information about SD and HD  in
                            AVC-Intra,                                     see
                            https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7290936.  For
                            information   about   4K/2K   in   AVC-Intra,  see
                            https://pro-av.panasonic.net/en/avc-ultra/AVC-ULTRAoverview.pdf.

                            AvcIntraClass -> (string)
                               Specify the AVC-Intra class of your output. The
                               AVC-Intra class selection determines the output
                               video  bit  rate depending on the frame rate of
                               the output. Outputs with  higher  class  values
                               have  higher  bitrates and improved image qual-
                               ity. Note that for  Class  4K/2K,  MediaConvert
                               supports only 4:2:2 chroma subsampling.

                            AvcIntraUhdSettings -> (structure)
                               Optional when you set AVC-Intra class (avcIntr-
                               aClass) to Class 4K/2K (CLASS_4K_2K). When  you
                               set  AVC-Intra class to a different value, this
                               object isn't allowed.

                               QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                   Optional. Use Quality tuning level  (quali-
                                   tyTuningLevel) to choose how many transcod-
                                   ing  passes  MediaConvert  does  with  your
                                   video.    When    you   choose   Multi-pass
                                   (MULTI_PASS), your video quality is  better
                                   and  your  output bitrate is more accurate.
                                   That is, the actual bitrate of your  output
                                   is  closer to the target bitrate defined in
                                   the specification.  When  you  choose  Sin-
                                   gle-pass  (SINGLE_PASS), your encoding time
                                   is faster. The  default  behavior  is  Sin-
                                   gle-pass (SINGLE_PASS).

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as  a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating   your
                               transcoding  job  specification  as a JSON file
                               without the console,  use  FramerateControl  to
                               specify  which  value  the service uses for the
                               frame rate for  this  output.  Choose  INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the service to use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if  you  want the service to use the frame rate
                               you specify in the settings  FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP) for numerically simple  conversions,
                               such  as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically com-
                               plex conversions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                               TERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter. This results in a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions, especially if your source video has  al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best conversion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                               that  using FrameFormer increases the transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose the scan line type for the output.  Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create a progressive output, regardless of  the
                               scan  type  of  your input. Use Top field first
                               (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom   field   first   (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's inter-
                               laced with the same field polarity  throughout.
                               Use  Follow,  default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course of the output. Follow  behavior  depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced, the output will be interlaced  with  the
                               same  polarity  as the source. If the source is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top  field  bottom  field  first,  depending on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to create a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each  progressive  frame  from the input corre-
                               sponds to an interlaced field  in  the  output.
                               Keep  the default value, Basic interlacing (IN-
                               TERLACED), for all other  output  frame  rates.
                               With  basic  interlacing, MediaConvert performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a  value  that isn't suitable for optimized in-
                               terlacing,  MediaConvert  automatically   falls
                               back  to  basic interlacing. Required settings:
                               To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                               Telecine  (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels  the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to keep it synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the duration of your video. Required  settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                               job specification,  set  (framerateControl)  to
                               (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25  and
                               (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable  hard  telecine (HARD) to create a
                               smoother picture. When  you  keep  the  default
                               value,  None  (NONE), MediaConvert does a stan-
                               dard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without do-
                               ing  anything with the field polarity to create
                               a smoother picture.

                        Codec -> (string)
                            Specifies the video codec. This must be  equal  to
                            one  of  the  enum  values  defined  by the object
                            VideoCodec.

                        FrameCaptureSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value FRAME_CAPTURE.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               Frame  capture  will  encode the first frame of
                               the output stream, then one frame every framer-
                               ateDenominator/framerateNumerator  seconds. For
                               example, settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and
                               framerateDenominator  =  3 (a rate of 1/3 frame
                               per second) will capture the first frame,  then
                               1  frame every 3s. Files will be named as file-
                               name.n.jpg where n is the 0-based sequence num-
                               ber of each Capture.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               Frame  capture  will  encode the first frame of
                               the output stream, then one frame every framer-
                               ateDenominator/framerateNumerator  seconds. For
                               example, settings of framerateNumerator = 1 and
                               framerateDenominator  =  3 (a rate of 1/3 frame
                               per second) will capture the first frame,  then
                               1  frame every 3s. Files will be named as file-
                               name.NNNNNNN.jpg where N is the  0-based  frame
                               sequence   number  zero  padded  to  7  decimal
                               places.

                            MaxCaptures -> (integer)
                               Maximum number of captures (encoded jpg  output
                               files).

                            Quality -> (integer)
                               JPEG  Quality  -  a  higher value equals higher
                               quality.

                        H264Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value H_264.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default value, Auto (AUTO), for this
                               setting to have MediaConvert automatically  ap-
                               ply  the  best  types  of quantization for your
                               video content. When  you  want  to  apply  your
                               quantization  settings  manually,  you must set
                               H264AdaptiveQuantization to a value other  than
                               Auto  (AUTO).  Use  this setting to specify the
                               strength of any adaptive  quantization  filters
                               that you enable. If you don't want MediaConvert
                               to  do  any  adaptive  quantization   in   this
                               transcode, set Adaptive quantization (H264Adap-
                               tiveQuantization) to Off  (OFF).  Related  set-
                               tings:  The  value that you choose here applies
                               to the following settings: H264FlickerAdaptive-
                               Quantization,  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization,
                               and H264TemporalAdaptiveQuantization.

                            BandwidthReductionFilter -> (structure)
                               The Bandwidth reduction  filter  increases  the
                               video  quality  of  your output relative to its
                               bitrate. Use to lower the bitrate of your  con-
                               stant  quality  QVBR  output, with little or no
                               perceptual decrease in quality. Or, use to  in-
                               crease  the video quality of outputs with other
                               rate control modes relative to the bitrate that
                               you specify. Bandwidth reduction increases fur-
                               ther when your input is low quality  or  noisy.
                               Outputs  that  use  this feature incur pro-tier
                               pricing. When you include  Bandwidth  reduction
                               filter,  you  cannot  include the Noise reducer
                               preprocessor.

                               Sharpening -> (string)
                                   Optionally specify the level of  sharpening
                                   to  apply when you use the Bandwidth reduc-
                                   tion filter. Sharpening  adds  contrast  to
                                   the edges of your video content and can re-
                                   duce softness. Keep the default  value  Off
                                   to  apply  no  sharpening.  Set  Sharpening
                                   strength to Low to apply a  minimal  amount
                                   of  sharpening,  or High to apply a maximum
                                   amount of sharpening.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Specify the strength of the  Bandwidth  re-
                                   duction filter. For most workflows, we rec-
                                   ommend that you choose Auto to  reduce  the
                                   bandwidth  of your output with little to no
                                   perceptual decrease in video  quality.  For
                                   high  quality  and  high  bitrate  outputs,
                                   choose Low. For the most  bandwidth  reduc-
                                   tion,  choose  High.  We recommend that you
                                   choose High for low bitrate  outputs.  Note
                                   that  High  may  incur a slight increase in
                                   the softness of your output.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               Required  for  VBR  and CBR. For MS Smooth out-
                               puts, bitrates must be unique when rounded down
                               to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                            CodecLevel -> (string)
                               Specify  an H.264 level that is consistent with
                               your output video settings. If you aren't  sure
                               what level to specify, choose Auto (AUTO).

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               H.264  Profile.  High 4:2:2 and 10-bit profiles
                               are only available with the AVC-I License.

                            DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                               Choose Adaptive  to  improve  subjective  video
                               quality  for  high-motion  content.  This  will
                               cause the service to use fewer B-frames  (which
                               infer  information  based  on other frames) for
                               high-motion portions  of  the  video  and  more
                               B-frames  for  low-motion portions. The maximum
                               number of B-frames is limited by the value  you
                               provide for the setting B frames between refer-
                               ence   frames   (numberBFramesBetweenReference-
                               Frames).

                            EntropyEncoding -> (string)
                               Entropy  encoding  mode.  Use CABAC (must be in
                               Main or High profile) or CAVLC.

                            FieldEncoding -> (string)
                               The video encoding method for your  MPEG-4  AVC
                               output.  Keep  the default value, PAFF, to have
                               MediaConvert use PAFF encoding  for  interlaced
                               outputs.  Choose  Force  field (FORCE_FIELD) to
                               disable PAFF encoding and create  separate  in-
                               terlaced  fields.  Choose MBAFF to disable PAFF
                               and have MediaConvert use  MBAFF  encoding  for
                               interlaced outputs.

                            FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Only  use  this setting when you change the de-

                               zation  to a value other than AUTO, the default
                               value  for  H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization  is
                               Disabled  (DISABLED).  Change this value to En-
                               abled (ENABLED) to reduce I-frame pop.  I-frame
                               pop  appears as a visual flicker that can arise
                               when the encoder saves  bits  by  copying  some
                               macroblocks many times from frame to frame, and
                               then refreshes them at the  I-frame.  When  you
                               enable  this setting, the encoder updates these
                               macroblocks slightly more often to  smooth  out
                               the  flicker.  To  manually  enable  or disable
                               H264FlickerAdaptiveQuantization, you  must  set
                               Adaptive   quantization  (H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                               tion) to a value other than AUTO.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as   a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating  your
                               transcoding job specification as  a  JSON  file
                               without  the  console,  use FramerateControl to
                               specify which value the service  uses  for  the
                               frame  rate  for  this  output. Choose INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to  use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if you want the service to use the  frame  rate
                               you  specify in the settings FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP)  for numerically simple conversions,
                               such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically  com-
                               plex  conversions, you can use interpolate (IN-
                               TERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in  a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions,  especially if your source video has al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best  conversion  method  frame  by frame. Note
                               that using FrameFormer increases the  transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               If  enable,  use  reference  B  frames  for GOP
                               structures that have B frames > 1.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed  GOP,  set this value to 5. We recommend
                               that  you  have  the  transcoder  automatically
                               choose this value for you based on characteris-
                               tics of your input video. To enable this  auto-
                               matic behavior, keep the default value by leav-
                               ing this setting out of your JSON job  specifi-
                               cation.  In the console, do this by keeping the
                               default empty value. If you do explicitly spec-
                               ify  a  value, for segmented outputs, don't set
                               this value to 0.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Use this setting only when  you  set  GOP  mode
                               control  (GopSizeUnits)  to  Specified,  frames
                               (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SECONDS). Spec-
                               ify  the  GOP  length  using  a whole number of
                               frames or a decimal value of seconds. MediaCon-
                               vert  will  interpret  this  value as frames or
                               seconds depending on the value you  choose  for
                               GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If you want to
                               allow MediaConvert to  automatically  determine
                               GOP size, leave GOP size blank and set GOP mode
                               control to Auto (AUTO). If  your  output  group
                               specifies  HLS,  DASH,  or CMAF, leave GOP size
                               blank and set GOP mode control to Auto in  each
                               output in your output group.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify  how the transcoder determines GOP size
                               for this output. We recommend that you have the
                               transcoder  automatically choose this value for
                               you based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                               video.   To  enable  this  automatic  behavior,
                               choose Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                               Size)  blank.  By default, if you don't specify
                               GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits),  MediaConvert
                               will  use  automatic  behavior.  If your output
                               group specifies HLS, DASH,  or  CMAF,  set  GOP
                               mode  control  to Auto and leave GOP size blank
                               in each output in your output group. To explic-
                               itly  specify the GOP length, choose Specified,
                               frames (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SECONDS)
                               and  then provide the GOP length in the related
                               setting GOP size (GopSize).

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If your downstream systems have  strict  buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the HRD buffer that's available at the  end  of
                               each  encoded video segment. For the best video
                               quality: Set to 0 or leave blank  to  automati-
                               cally  determine the final buffer fill percent-
                               age.

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage of the buffer that should  initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size  of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits. For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose the scan line type for the output.  Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create a progressive output, regardless of  the
                               scan  type  of  your input. Use Top field first
                               (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom   field   first   (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's inter-
                               laced with the same field polarity  throughout.
                               Use  Follow,  default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course of the output. Follow  behavior  depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced, the output will be interlaced  with  the
                               same  polarity  as the source. If the source is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top  field  bottom  field  first,  depending on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use this setting  only  when  you  also  enable
                               Scene   change  detection  (SceneChangeDetect).
                               This setting determines how the encoder manages
                               the spacing between I-frames that it inserts as
                               part of the I-frame cadence  and  the  I-frames
                               that  it inserts for Scene change detection. We
                               recommend that you have the transcoder automat-
                               ically choose this value for you based on char-
                               acteristics of your input video. To enable this
                               automatic  behavior,  keep the default value by
                               leaving this setting out of your JSON job spec-
                               ification.  In  the console, do this by keeping
                               the default empty value.  When  you  explicitly
                               specify  a  value for this setting, the encoder
                               determines whether  to  skip  a  cadence-driven
                               I-frame  by  the value you set. For example, if
                               you set Min I interval (minIInterval) to 5  and
                               a  cadence-driven  I-frame  would fall within 5
                               frames of a scene-change I-frame, then the  en-
                               coder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this
                               way, one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP  is
                               stretched  slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven
                               I-frames  are  farther  from  the  scene-change
                               I-frame  than  the  value you set, then the en-
                               coder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs
                               surrounding  the  scene change are smaller than
                               the usual cadence GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               This  setting  to  determines  the  number   of
                               B-frames  that MediaConvert puts between refer-
                               ence frames in this output. We  recommend  that
                               you   use   automatic  behavior  to  allow  the
                               transcoder to choose the best  value  based  on
                               characteristics  of  your  input  video. In the
                               console, choose AUTO to select  this  automatic
                               behavior.  When you manually edit your JSON job
                               specification, leave this setting out to choose
                               automatic  behavior.  When  you want to specify
                               this number explicitly, choose a  whole  number
                               from 0 through 7.

                            NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Number  of reference frames to use. The encoder
                               may use more than requested if  using  B-frames
                               and/or interlaced encoding.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  how  the service determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for  this  output.
                               The  default  behavior, Follow source (INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR from your  input
                               video  for  your output. To specify a different
                               PAR in the console, choose any value other than
                               Follow  source.  To  specify a different PAR by
                               editing  the  JSON  job  specification,  choose
                               SPECIFIED.  When  you choose SPECIFIED for this
                               setting, you must also specify values  for  the
                               parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how you want to  trade  off
                               encoding  speed  for  output video quality. The
                               default behavior is faster, lower quality, sin-
                               gle-pass encoding.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  for  quality-defined variable bitrate
                               encoding with the H.265 codec. Use  these  set-
                               tings  only  when you set QVBR for Rate control
                               mode (RateControlMode).

                               MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting  only  when  Rate  control
                                   mode  is  QVBR  and Quality tuning level is
                                   Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate val-
                                   ues  suited to the complexity of your input
                                   video, the service limits the  average  bi-
                                   trate  of  the video part of this output to
                                   the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                                   tal  size of the video element is less than
                                   or equal to the value you set multiplied by
                                   the number of seconds of encoded output.

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control  mode  (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.
                                   Specify  the  target quality level for this
                                   output. MediaConvert determines  the  right
                                   number  of bits to use for each part of the
                                   video to maintain the  video  quality  that
                                   you  specify.  When  you  keep  the default
                                   value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks  a  quality
                                   level  for you, based on characteristics of
                                   your input video. If you prefer to  specify
                                   a  quality  level,  specify a number from 1
                                   through 10. Use higher numbers for  greater
                                   quality.  Level  10 results in nearly loss-
                                   less compression.  The  quality  level  for
                                   most  broadcast-quality  transcodes  is be-
                                   tween 6 and 9.  Optionally,  to  specify  a
                                   value between whole numbers, also provide a
                                   value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune.  For  example,  if you want your QVBR
                                   quality level to  be  7.33,  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional. Specify a value here to  set  the
                                   QVBR  quality  to  a  level that is between
                                   whole numbers. For  example,  if  you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est  third  of a whole number. For example,
                                   if you set qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  you
                                   set  qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25, your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting to specify whether this output
                               has  a variable bitrate (VBR), constant bitrate
                               (CBR)  or  quality-defined   variable   bitrate
                               (QVBR).

                            RepeatPps -> (string)
                               Places  a  PPS  header on each encoded picture,
                               even if repeated.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to create a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each  progressive  frame  from the input corre-
                               sponds to an interlaced field  in  the  output.
                               Keep  the default value, Basic interlacing (IN-
                               TERLACED), for all other  output  frame  rates.
                               With  basic  interlacing, MediaConvert performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a  value  that isn't suitable for optimized in-
                               terlacing,  MediaConvert  automatically   falls
                               back  to  basic interlacing. Required settings:
                               To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                               Telecine  (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene
                               changes that the service automatically detects.
                               This  improves  video quality and is enabled by
                               default. If this output uses QVBR, choose Tran-
                               sition   detection  (TRANSITION_DETECTION)  for
                               further video quality improvement. For more in-
                               formation         about        QVBR,        see
                               https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/cbr-vbr-qvbr.

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or equal to the number of macroblock  rows  for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half the number of macroblock rows  for  inter-
                               laced pictures.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels  the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to keep it synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the duration of your video. Required  settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                               job specification,  set  (framerateControl)  to
                               (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25  and
                               (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore this setting unless you need  to  comply
                               with  a  specification that requires a specific
                               value. If you don't have  a  specification  re-
                               quirement,  we  recommend  that  you adjust the
                               softness of your output by using a lower  value
                               for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by en-
                               abling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFil-
                               ter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies
                               the  quantization  matrices  that  the  encoder
                               uses. Keep the default value, 0, for flat quan-
                               tization. Choose the value 1 or 16 to  use  the
                               default  JVT  softening  quantization matricies
                               from the H.264 specification.  Choose  a  value
                               from 17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. In-
                               creasing values from 17 to 128  result  in  in-
                               creasing  reduction of high-frequency data. The

                               Only use this setting when you change  the  de-
                               fault  value,  Auto  (AUTO),  for  the  setting
                               H264AdaptiveQuantization. When you keep all de-
                               faults,  excluding H264AdaptiveQuantization and
                               all other adaptive quantization from your  JSON
                               job  specification,  MediaConvert automatically
                               applies the best types of quantization for your
                               video content. When you set H264AdaptiveQuanti-
                               zation to a value other than AUTO, the  default
                               value  for  H264SpatialAdaptiveQuantization  is
                               Enabled (ENABLED). Keep this default  value  to
                               adjust  quantization within each frame based on
                               spatial variation of content  complexity.  When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits on areas that can sustain more  distortion
                               with  no noticeable visual degradation and uses
                               more bits on areas where any  small  distortion
                               will  be  noticeable. For example, complex tex-
                               tured blocks are encoded with  fewer  bits  and
                               smooth  textured  blocks  are encoded with more
                               bits. Enabling this feature will almost  always
                               improve  your video quality. Note, though, that
                               this feature doesn't take  into  account  where
                               the  viewer's  attention  is  likely  to be. If

                               smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces
                               a 29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT)  produces
                               an  output with a 23.976 output that signals to
                               the video player device to  do  the  conversion
                               during  play  back.  When  you keep the default

                            FlickerAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to have the encoder  reduce
                               I-frame  pop.  I-frame  pop appears as a visual
                               flicker that can arise when the  encoder  saves
                               bits  by  copying  some  macroblocks many times
                               from frame to frame, and then refreshes them at
                               the  I-frame. When you enable this setting, the
                               encoder updates these macroblocks slightly more
                               often  to  smooth out the flicker. This setting
                               is disabled by default. Related setting: In ad-
                               dition  to enabling this setting, you must also
                               set adaptiveQuantization to a value other  than

                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as  a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating   your
                               transcoding  job  specification  as a JSON file
                               without the console,  use  FramerateControl  to
                               specify  which  value  the service uses for the
                               frame rate for  this  output.  Choose  INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the service to use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if  you  want the service to use the frame rate
                               you specify in the settings  FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP) for numerically simple  conversions,
                               such  as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically com-
                               plex conversions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                               TERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter. This results in a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions, especially if your source video has  al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best conversion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                               that  using FrameFormer increases the transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopBReference -> (string)
                               If enable,  use  reference  B  frames  for  GOP
                               structures that have B frames > 1.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed GOP, set this value to 5.  We  recommend
                               that  you  have  the  transcoder  automatically
                               choose this value for you based on characteris-
                               tics  of your input video. To enable this auto-
                               matic behavior, keep the default value by leav-
                               ing  this setting out of your JSON job specifi-
                               cation. In the console, do this by keeping  the
                               default empty value. If you do explicitly spec-
                               ify a value, for segmented outputs,  don't  set
                               this value to 0.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when you set GOP mode
                               control  (GopSizeUnits)  to  Specified,  frames
                               (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SECONDS). Spec-
                               ify the GOP length  using  a  whole  number  of
                               frames or a decimal value of seconds. MediaCon-
                               vert will interpret this  value  as  frames  or
                               seconds  depending  on the value you choose for
                               GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits). If you want to
                               allow  MediaConvert  to automatically determine
                               GOP size, leave GOP size blank and set GOP mode
                               control  to  Auto  (AUTO). If your output group
                               specifies HLS, DASH, or CMAF,  leave  GOP  size
                               blank  and set GOP mode control to Auto in each
                               output in your output group.

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify how the transcoder determines GOP  size
                               for this output. We recommend that you have the
                               transcoder automatically choose this value  for
                               you  based  on  characteristics  of  your input
                               video.  To  enable  this  automatic   behavior,
                               choose Auto (AUTO) and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                               Size) blank. By default, if you  don't  specify
                               GOP  mode  control (GopSizeUnits), MediaConvert
                               will use automatic  behavior.  If  your  output
                               group  specifies  HLS,  DASH,  or CMAF, set GOP
                               mode control to Auto and leave GOP  size  blank
                               in each output in your output group. To explic-
                               itly specify the GOP length, choose  Specified,
                               frames (FRAMES) or Specified, seconds (SECONDS)
                               and then provide the GOP length in the  related
                               setting GOP size (GopSize).

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If  your  downstream systems have strict buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the  HRD  buffer that's available at the end of
                               each encoded video segment. For the best  video
                               quality:  Set  to 0 or leave blank to automati-
                               cally determine the final buffer fill  percent-
                               age.

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage  of the buffer that should initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create  a progressive output, regardless of the
                               scan type of your input. Use  Top  field  first
                               (TOP_FIELD)   or   Bottom   field  first  (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD) to create an  output  that's  inter-
                               laced  with the same field polarity throughout.
                               Use Follow, default top  (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course  of  the output. Follow behavior depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced,  the  output will be interlaced with the
                               same polarity as the source. If the  source  is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top field  bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum  bitrate  in  bits/second. For example,
                               enter five megabits per second as 5000000.  Re-
                               quired when Rate control mode is QVBR.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when  you also enable
                               Scene  change  detection   (SceneChangeDetect).
                               This setting determines how the encoder manages
                               the spacing between I-frames that it inserts as
                               part  of  the  I-frame cadence and the I-frames
                               that it inserts for Scene change detection.  We
                               recommend that you have the transcoder automat-
                               ically choose this value for you based on char-
                               acteristics of your input video. To enable this
                               automatic behavior, keep the default  value  by
                               leaving this setting out of your JSON job spec-
                               ification. In the console, do this  by  keeping
                               the  default  empty  value. When you explicitly
                               specify a value for this setting,  the  encoder
                               determines  whether  to  skip  a cadence-driven
                               I-frame by the value you set. For  example,  if
                               you  set Min I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and
                               a cadence-driven I-frame would  fall  within  5
                               frames  of a scene-change I-frame, then the en-
                               coder skips the cadence-driven I-frame. In this
                               way,  one GOP is shrunk slightly and one GOP is
                               stretched  slightly.  When  the  cadence-driven
                               I-frames  are  farther  from  the  scene-change
                               I-frame than the value you set,  then  the  en-
                               coder leaves all I-frames in place and the GOPs
                               surrounding the scene change are  smaller  than
                               the usual cadence GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  number of B-frames that MediaCon-
                               vert puts between reference frames in this out-
                               put.  Valid  values  are  whole  numbers from 0
                               through 7. When you don't specify a value,  Me-
                               diaConvert defaults to 2.

                            NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Number  of reference frames to use. The encoder
                               may use more than requested if  using  B-frames
                               and/or interlaced encoding.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  how  the service determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for  this  output.
                               The  default  behavior, Follow source (INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR from your  input
                               video  for  your output. To specify a different
                               PAR in the console, choose any value other than
                               Follow  source.  To  specify a different PAR by
                               editing  the  JSON  job  specification,  choose
                               SPECIFIED.  When  you choose SPECIFIED for this
                               setting, you must also specify values  for  the
                               parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how you want to  trade  off
                               encoding  speed  for  output video quality. The
                               default behavior is faster, lower quality, sin-
                               gle-pass encoding.

                            QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  for  quality-defined variable bitrate
                               encoding with the H.265 codec. Use  these  set-
                               tings  only  when you set QVBR for Rate control
                               mode (RateControlMode).

                               MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                   Use this setting  only  when  Rate  control
                                   mode  is  QVBR  and Quality tuning level is
                                   Multi-pass HQ. For Max average bitrate val-
                                   ues  suited to the complexity of your input
                                   video, the service limits the  average  bi-
                                   trate  of  the video part of this output to
                                   the value that you choose. That is, the to-
                                   tal  size of the video element is less than
                                   or equal to the value you set multiplied by
                                   the number of seconds of encoded output.

                               QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                   Use  this  setting  only  when you set Rate
                                   control  mode  (RateControlMode)  to  QVBR.
                                   Specify  the  target quality level for this
                                   output. MediaConvert determines  the  right
                                   number  of bits to use for each part of the
                                   video to maintain the  video  quality  that
                                   you  specify.  When  you  keep  the default
                                   value, AUTO, MediaConvert picks  a  quality
                                   level  for you, based on characteristics of
                                   your input video. If you prefer to  specify
                                   a  quality  level,  specify a number from 1
                                   through 10. Use higher numbers for  greater
                                   quality.  Level  10 results in nearly loss-
                                   less compression.  The  quality  level  for
                                   most  broadcast-quality  transcodes  is be-
                                   tween 6 and 9.  Optionally,  to  specify  a
                                   value between whole numbers, also provide a
                                   value for the setting qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune.  For  example,  if you want your QVBR
                                   quality level to  be  7.33,  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevel to 7 and set qvbrQualityLevelFine-
                                   Tune to .33.

                               QvbrQualityLevelFineTune -> (double)
                                   Optional. Specify a value here to  set  the
                                   QVBR  quality  to  a  level that is between
                                   whole numbers. For  example,  if  you  want
                                   your  QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33, set
                                   qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  set  qvbrQual-
                                   ityLevelFineTune   to   .33.   MediaConvert
                                   rounds your QVBR quality level to the near-
                                   est  third  of a whole number. For example,
                                   if you set qvbrQualityLevel to  7  and  you
                                   set  qvbrQualityLevelFineTune  to .25, your
                                   actual QVBR quality level is 7.33.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting to specify whether this output
                               has  a variable bitrate (VBR), constant bitrate
                               (CBR)  or  quality-defined   variable   bitrate
                               (QVBR).

                            SampleAdaptiveOffsetFilterMode -> (string)
                               Specify  Sample  Adaptive  Offset  (SAO) filter
                               strength.  Adaptive  mode  dynamically  selects
                               best strength based on content

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting for interlaced outputs, when
                               your output frame rate is half  of  your  input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE) to  create  a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each progressive frame from  the  input  corre-
                               sponds  to  an  interlaced field in the output.
                               Keep the default value, Basic interlacing  (IN-
                               TERLACED),  for  all  other output frame rates.
                               With basic interlacing,  MediaConvert  performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a value that isn't suitable for  optimized  in-
                               terlacing,   MediaConvert  automatically  falls
                               back to basic interlacing.  Required  settings:
                               To  use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must set
                               Telecine (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or  Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene
                               changes that the service automatically detects.
                               This improves video quality and is  enabled  by
                               default. If this output uses QVBR, choose Tran-
                               sition  detection  (TRANSITION_DETECTION)   for
                               further video quality improvement. For more in-
                               formation        about        QVBR,         see

                            Slices -> (integer)
                               Number of slices per picture. Must be less than
                               or  equal  to the number of macroblock rows for
                               progressive pictures, and less than or equal to
                               half  the  number of macroblock rows for inter-
                               laced pictures.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you  enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to  keep  it  synchronized with the video. Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the  duration of your video. Required settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                               job  specification,  set  (framerateControl) to
                               (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25  and
                               (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to
                               adjust quantization within each frame based  on
                               spatial  variation  of content complexity. When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits  on areas that can sustain more distortion
                               with no noticeable visual degradation and  uses
                               more  bits  on areas where any small distortion
                               will be noticeable. For example,  complex  tex-
                               tured  blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and
                               smooth textured blocks are  encoded  with  more
                               bits.  Enabling this feature will almost always
                               improve your video quality. Note, though,  that
                               this  feature  doesn't  take into account where
                               the viewer's attention  is  likely  to  be.  If
                               viewers  are likely to be focusing their atten-
                               tion on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                               plex  texture, you might choose to disable this
                               feature. Related setting: When you enable  spa-
                               tial  adaptive  quantization, set the value for
                               Adaptive  quantization   (adaptiveQuantization)
                               depending on your content. For homogeneous con-
                               tent, such as cartoons and video games, set  it
                               to  Low.  For  content  with a wider variety of
                               textures, set it to High or Higher.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               This field applies only if the  Streams  >  Ad-

                               -  Soft:  produces  23.976; the player converts
                               this output to 29.97i.

                            TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the default value, Enabled  (ENABLED),  to
                               adjust  quantization within each frame based on
                               temporal variation of content complexity.  When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits on areas of the frame that  aren't  moving
                               and  uses  more  bits  on  complex objects with
                               sharp edges that move a lot. For example,  this
                               feature  improves the readability of text tick-
                               ers on  newscasts  and  scoreboards  on  sports
                               matches.  Enabling this feature will almost al-
                               ways improve your video quality. Note,  though,
                               that  this  feature  doesn't  take into account
                               where the viewer's attention is likely  to  be.
                               If  viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                               tention on a part of the  screen  that  doesn't
                               have  moving  objects with sharp edges, such as
                               sports athletes' faces,  you  might  choose  to
                               disable this feature. Related setting: When you
                               enable  temporal   quantization,   adjust   the
                               strength  of  the filter with the setting Adap-
                               tive quantization (adaptiveQuantization).

                            TemporalIds -> (string)
                               Enables temporal layer identifiers in  the  en-
                               coded  bitstream.  Up to 3 layers are supported
                               depending on GOP  structure:  I-  and  P-frames
                               form  one  layer, reference B-frames can form a
                               second layer  and  non-reference  b-frames  can
                               form a third layer. Decoders can optionally de-
                               code only the lower temporal layers to generate
                               a lower frame rate output. For example, given a
                               bitstream with temporal IDs and with b-frames =
                               1  (i.e. IbPbPb display order), a decoder could
                               decode all the frames for full frame rate  out-
                               put or only the I and P frames (lowest temporal
                               layer) for a half frame rate output.

                            Tiles -> (string)
                               Enable use of  tiles,  allowing  horizontal  as
                               well  as  vertical  subdivision  of the encoded
                               pictures.

                            UnregisteredSeiTimecode -> (string)
                               Inserts timecode for each frame as 4  bytes  of
                               an unregistered SEI message.

                            WriteMp4PackagingType -> (string)
                               If  the  location  of  parameter  set NAL units
                               doesn't matter in your  workflow,  ignore  this
                               setting.  Use  this  setting  only with CMAF or
                               DASH outputs, or with standalone  file  outputs
                               in  an  MPEG-4  container (MP4 outputs). Choose
                               HVC1 to mark your output as  HVC1.  This  makes
                               your output compliant with the following speci-
                               fication: ISO IECJTC1 SC29 N13798 Text  ISO/IEC
                               FDIS  14496-15  3rd Edition. For these outputs,
                               the service stores parameter set NAL  units  in
                               the  sample  headers but not in the samples di-
                               rectly. For MP4 outputs, when you choose  HVC1,
                               your  output video might not work properly with
                               some downstream systems and video players.  The
                               service  defaults  to  marking  your  output as
                               HEV1. For these outputs, the service writes pa-
                               rameter  set  NAL  units directly into the sam-
                               ples.

                        Mpeg2Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value MPEG2.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Specify  the strength of any adaptive quantiza-
                               tion filters that you enable.  The  value  that
                               you  choose  here applies to the following set-
                               tings: Spatial adaptive quantization  (spatial-
                               AdaptiveQuantization),  and  Temporal  adaptive
                               quantization (temporalAdaptiveQuantization).

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Specify the average bitrate in bits per second.
                               Required  for  VBR  and CBR. For MS Smooth out-
                               puts, bitrates must be unique when rounded down
                               to the nearest multiple of 1000.

                            CodecLevel -> (string)
                               Use  Level  (Mpeg2CodecLevel) to set the MPEG-2
                               level for the video output.

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               Use  Profile  (Mpeg2CodecProfile)  to  set  the
                               MPEG-2 profile for the video output.

                            DynamicSubGop -> (string)
                               Choose  Adaptive  to  improve  subjective video
                               quality  for  high-motion  content.  This  will
                               cause  the service to use fewer B-frames (which
                               infer information based on  other  frames)  for
                               high-motion  portions  of  the  video  and more
                               B-frames for low-motion portions.  The  maximum
                               number  of B-frames is limited by the value you
                               provide for the setting B frames between refer-
                               ence   frames   (numberBFramesBetweenReference-
                               Frames).

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as   a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating  your
                               transcoding job specification as  a  JSON  file
                               without  the  console,  use FramerateControl to
                               specify which value the service  uses  for  the
                               frame  rate  for  this  output. Choose INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to  use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if you want the service to use the  frame  rate
                               you  specify in the settings FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP)  for numerically simple conversions,
                               such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically  com-
                               plex  conversions, you can use interpolate (IN-
                               TERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in  a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions,  especially if your source video has al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best  conversion  method  frame  by frame. Note
                               that using FrameFormer increases the  transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  relative  frequency  of  open  to
                               closed GOPs in this output. For example, if you
                               want to allow four open GOPs and then require a
                               closed GOP, set this value to 5. When you  cre-
                               ate  a  streaming output, we recommend that you
                               keep the default  value,  1,  so  that  players
                               starting  mid-stream  receive  an  IDR frame as
                               quickly as possible. Don't set this value to 0;
                               that would break output segmenting.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               Specify the interval between keyframes, in sec-
                               onds or frames, for this  output.  Default:  12
                               Related settings: When you specify the GOP size
                               in seconds, set GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits)
                               to  Specified,  seconds  (SECONDS). The default
                               value for GOP mode  control  (GopSizeUnits)  is
                               Frames (FRAMES).

                            GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                               Specify  the  units  for GOP size (GopSize). If
                               you don't specify a value here, by default  the
                               encoder measures GOP size in frames.

                            HrdBufferFinalFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               If  your  downstream systems have strict buffer
                               requirements: Specify the minimum percentage of
                               the  HRD  buffer that's available at the end of
                               each encoded video segment. For the best  video
                               quality:  Set  to 0 or leave blank to automati-
                               cally determine the final buffer fill  percent-
                               age.

                            HrdBufferInitialFillPercentage -> (integer)
                               Percentage  of the buffer that should initially
                               be filled (HRD buffer model).

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose  the scan line type for the output. Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create  a progressive output, regardless of the
                               scan type of your input. Use  Top  field  first
                               (TOP_FIELD)   or   Bottom   field  first  (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD) to create an  output  that's  inter-
                               laced  with the same field polarity throughout.
                               Use Follow, default top  (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD)  or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course  of  the output. Follow behavior depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced,  the  output will be interlaced with the
                               same polarity as the source. If the  source  is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top field  bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                            IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                               Use  Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraDcPrecision)
                               to set quantization precision  for  intra-block
                               DC  coefficients. If you choose the value auto,
                               the service will automatically select the  pre-
                               cision  based  on the per-frame compression ra-
                               tio.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            MinIInterval -> (integer)
                               Use  this  setting  only  when  you also enable
                               Scene  change  detection   (SceneChangeDetect).
                               This setting determines how the encoder manages
                               the spacing between I-frames that it inserts as
                               part  of  the  I-frame cadence and the I-frames
                               that it inserts  for  Scene  change  detection.
                               When  you specify a value for this setting, the
                               encoder  determines  whether  to  skip  a   ca-
                               dence-driven  I-frame by the value you set. For
                               example, if you set Min I interval  (minIInter-
                               val)  to  5  and a cadence-driven I-frame would
                               fall within 5 frames of a scene-change I-frame,
                               then   the  encoder  skips  the  cadence-driven
                               I-frame.  In  this  way,  one  GOP  is   shrunk
                               slightly  and  one  GOP  is stretched slightly.
                               When the cadence-driven  I-frames  are  farther
                               from  the  scene-change  I-frame than the value
                               you set, then the encoder leaves  all  I-frames
                               in  place  and  the  GOPs surrounding the scene
                               change are smaller than the usual cadence GOPs.

                            NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                               Specify the number of B-frames  that  MediaCon-
                               vert puts between reference frames in this out-
                               put. Valid values  are  whole  numbers  from  0
                               through  7. When you don't specify a value, Me-
                               diaConvert defaults to 2.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from your input
                               video for your output. To specify  a  different
                               PAR in the console, choose any value other than
                               Follow source. To specify a  different  PAR  by
                               editing  the  JSON  job  specification,  choose
                               SPECIFIED. When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                               setting,  you  must also specify values for the
                               parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (par-
                               Control)  to  SPECIFIED.  On  the console, this
                               corresponds to  any  value  other  than  Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                               video  PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                               For example, for  D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (par-
                               Control)  to  SPECIFIED.  On  the console, this
                               corresponds to  any  value  other  than  Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                               video  PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                               For example, for  D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel)  to  choose how you want to trade off
                               encoding speed for output  video  quality.  The
                               default behavior is faster, lower quality, sin-
                               gle-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               Use Rate control mode (Mpeg2RateControlMode) to
                               specify  whether  the bitrate is variable (vbr)
                               or constant (cbr).

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to create a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each  progressive  frame  from the input corre-
                               sponds to an interlaced field  in  the  output.
                               Keep  the default value, Basic interlacing (IN-
                               TERLACED), for all other  output  frame  rates.
                               With  basic  interlacing, MediaConvert performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a  value  that isn't suitable for optimized in-
                               terlacing,  MediaConvert  automatically   falls
                               back  to  basic interlacing. Required settings:
                               To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                               Telecine  (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                               Enable this setting to insert I-frames at scene
                               changes that the service automatically detects.
                               This  improves  video quality and is enabled by
                               default.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you  enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to  keep  it  synchronized with the video. Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the  duration of your video. Required settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                               job  specification,  set  (framerateControl) to
                               (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25  and
                               (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore  this  setting unless you need to comply
                               with a specification that requires  a  specific
                               value.  If  you  don't have a specification re-
                               quirement, we recommend  that  you  adjust  the
                               softness  of your output by using a lower value
                               for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or by en-
                               abling a noise reducer filter (noiseReducerFil-
                               ter). The Softness (softness) setting specifies
                               the  quantization  matrices  that  the  encoder
                               uses. Keep the default value, 0, to use the AWS
                               Elemental default matrices. Choose a value from
                               17 to 128 to use planar interpolation. Increas-
                               ing  values from 17 to 128 result in increasing
                               reduction of high-frequency data. The value 128
                               results in the softest video.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default value, Enabled (ENABLED), to
                               adjust quantization within each frame based  on
                               spatial  variation  of content complexity. When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits  on areas that can sustain more distortion
                               with no noticeable visual degradation and  uses
                               more  bits  on areas where any small distortion
                               will be noticeable. For example,  complex  tex-
                               tured  blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and
                               smooth textured blocks are  encoded  with  more
                               bits.  Enabling this feature will almost always
                               improve your video quality. Note, though,  that
                               this  feature  doesn't  take into account where
                               the viewer's attention  is  likely  to  be.  If
                               viewers  are likely to be focusing their atten-
                               tion on a part of the screen with a lot of com-
                               plex  texture, you might choose to disable this
                               feature. Related setting: When you enable  spa-
                               tial  adaptive  quantization, set the value for
                               Adaptive  quantization   (adaptiveQuantization)
                               depending on your content. For homogeneous con-
                               tent, such as cartoons and video games, set  it
                               to  Low.  For  content  with a wider variety of
                               textures, set it to High or Higher.

                            Syntax -> (string)
                               Specify whether this output's  video  uses  the
                               D10  syntax.  Keep the default value to not use
                               the syntax. Related settings: When  you  choose
                               D10  (D_10) for your MXF profile (profile), you
                               must also set this value to D10 (D_10).

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable  hard or soft telecine to create a
                               smoother picture. Hard telecine (HARD) produces
                               a  29.97i output. Soft telecine (SOFT) produces
                               an output with a 23.976 output that signals  to
                               the  video  player  device to do the conversion
                               during play back. When  you  keep  the  default
                               value,  None  (NONE), MediaConvert does a stan-
                               dard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without do-
                               ing  anything with the field polarity to create
                               a smoother picture.

                            TemporalAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep the default value, Enabled  (ENABLED),  to
                               adjust  quantization within each frame based on
                               temporal variation of content complexity.  When
                               you enable this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                               bits on areas of the frame that  aren't  moving
                               and  uses  more  bits  on  complex objects with
                               sharp edges that move a lot. For example,  this
                               feature  improves the readability of text tick-
                               ers on  newscasts  and  scoreboards  on  sports
                               matches.  Enabling this feature will almost al-
                               ways improve your video quality. Note,  though,
                               that  this  feature  doesn't  take into account
                               where the viewer's attention is likely  to  be.
                               If  viewers are likely to be focusing their at-
                               tention on a part of the  screen  that  doesn't

                            ChromaSampling -> (string)
                               This  setting  applies  only to ProRes 4444 and
                               ProRes 4444 XQ outputs that you create from in-
                               puts  that  use 4:4:4 chroma sampling. Set Pre-

                               allow  outputs  to  also  use 4:4:4 chroma sam-
                               pling. You must specify a value for  this  set-
                               ting  when  your  output codec profile supports
                               4:4:4 chroma sampling. Related  Settings:  When
                               you  set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sam-
                               pling (PRESERVE_444_SAMPLING), you must  choose
                               an  output  codec  profile  that supports 4:4:4
                               chroma  sampling.  These  values  for   Profile
                               (CodecProfile)  support  4:4:4 chroma sampling:
                               Apple ProRes 4444 (APPLE_PRORES_4444) or  Apple
                               ProRes 4444 XQ (APPLE_PRORES_4444_XQ). When you
                               set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4 sampling,
                               you must disable all video preprocessors except
                               for Nexguard file marker (PartnerWatermarking).
                               When  you set Chroma sampling to Preserve 4:4:4
                               sampling and use framerate conversion, you must
                               set Frame rate conversion algorithm (Framerate-
                               ConversionAlgorithm) to Drop duplicate  (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP).

                            CodecProfile -> (string)
                               Use Profile (ProResCodecProfile) to specify the
                               type of Apple ProRes codec to use for this out-
                               put.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as  a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating   your
                               transcoding  job  specification  as a JSON file
                               without the console,  use  FramerateControl  to
                               specify  which  value  the service uses for the
                               frame rate for  this  output.  Choose  INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the service to use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if  you  want the service to use the frame rate
                               you specify in the settings  FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP) for numerically simple  conversions,
                               such  as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically com-
                               plex conversions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                               TERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter. This results in a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions, especially if your source video has  al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best conversion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                               that  using FrameFormer increases the transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Choose the scan line type for the output.  Keep
                               the default value, Progressive (PROGRESSIVE) to
                               create a progressive output, regardless of  the
                               scan  type  of  your input. Use Top field first
                               (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom   field   first   (BOT-
                               TOM_FIELD)  to  create  an output that's inter-
                               laced with the same field polarity  throughout.
                               Use  Follow,  default top (FOLLOW_TOP_FIELD) or
                               Follow, default bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to
                               produce outputs with the same field polarity as
                               the source. For jobs that have multiple inputs,
                               the output field polarity might change over the
                               course of the output. Follow  behavior  depends
                               on the input scan type. If the source is inter-
                               laced, the output will be interlaced  with  the
                               same  polarity  as the source. If the source is
                               progressive, the output will be interlaced with
                               top  field  bottom  field  first,  depending on
                               which of the Follow options you choose.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the  pixel  aspect ratio (PAR) for this output.
                               The default behavior, Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from your input
                               video for your output. To specify  a  different
                               PAR in the console, choose any value other than
                               Follow source. To specify a  different  PAR  by
                               editing  the  JSON  job  specification,  choose
                               SPECIFIED. When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                               setting,  you  must also specify values for the
                               parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (par-
                               Control)  to  SPECIFIED.  On  the console, this
                               corresponds to  any  value  other  than  Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                               video  PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                               For example, for  D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required when you set Pixel aspect ratio  (par-
                               Control)  to  SPECIFIED.  On  the console, this
                               corresponds to  any  value  other  than  Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio (PAR) that is different from  your  input
                               video  PAR, provide your output PAR as a ratio.
                               For example, for  D1/DV  NTSC  widescreen,  you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to create a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each  progressive  frame  from the input corre-
                               sponds to an interlaced field  in  the  output.
                               Keep  the default value, Basic interlacing (IN-
                               TERLACED), for all other  output  frame  rates.
                               With  basic  interlacing, MediaConvert performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a  value  that isn't suitable for optimized in-
                               terlacing,  MediaConvert  automatically   falls
                               back  to  basic interlacing. Required settings:
                               To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                               Telecine  (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25 fps output. When
                               you enable slow PAL, MediaConvert relabels  the
                               video frames to 25 fps and resamples your audio
                               to keep it synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                               that enabling this setting will slightly reduce
                               the duration of your video. Required  settings:
                               You must also set Framerate to 25. In your JSON
                               job specification,  set  (framerateControl)  to
                               (SPECIFIED),  (framerateNumerator)  to  25  and
                               (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable  hard  telecine (HARD) to create a
                               smoother picture. When  you  keep  the  default
                               value,  None  (NONE), MediaConvert does a stan-
                               dard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without do-

                        Vc3Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VC3

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the input video, choose Follow source.  If  you
                               want  to  do  frame  rate  conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the  dropdown  list  or  choose
                               Custom.  The  framerates  shown in the dropdown
                               list are decimal approximations  of  fractions.
                               If  you  choose Custom, specify your frame rate
                               as  a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating   your
                               transcoding  job  specification  as a JSON file
                               without the console,  use  FramerateControl  to
                               specify  which  value  the service uses for the
                               frame rate for  this  output.  Choose  INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the service to use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if  you  want the service to use the frame rate
                               you specify in the settings  FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP) for numerically simple  conversions,
                               such  as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically com-
                               plex conversions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                               TERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter. This results in a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions, especially if your source video has  al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best conversion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                               that  using FrameFormer increases the transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            InterlaceMode -> (string)
                               Optional. Choose the scan line  type  for  this
                               output. If you don't specify a value, MediaCon-
                               vert will create a progressive output.

                            ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                               Use this setting for interlaced  outputs,  when
                               your  output  frame  rate is half of your input
                               frame rate. In this situation, choose Optimized
                               interlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to create a
                               better quality interlaced output. In this case,
                               each  progressive  frame  from the input corre-
                               sponds to an interlaced field  in  the  output.
                               Keep  the default value, Basic interlacing (IN-
                               TERLACED), for all other  output  frame  rates.
                               With  basic  interlacing, MediaConvert performs
                               any frame rate conversion first and then inter-
                               laces the frames. When you choose Optimized in-
                               terlacing and you set your output frame rate to
                               a  value  that isn't suitable for optimized in-
                               terlacing,  MediaConvert  automatically   falls
                               back  to  basic interlacing. Required settings:
                               To use  optimized  interlacing,  you  must  set
                               Telecine  (telecine)  to  None  (NONE)  or Soft
                               (SOFT). You can't use optimized interlacing for
                               hard telecine outputs. You must also set Inter-
                               lace mode (interlaceMode) to a value other than
                               Progressive (PROGRESSIVE).

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your input frame
                               rate is 23.976 or 24 frames per  second  (fps).
                               Enable  slow  PAL  to create a 25 fps output by
                               relabeling the video frames and resampling your
                               audio.  Note  that  enabling  this setting will
                               slightly reduce the duration of your video. Re-
                               lated  settings: You must also set Framerate to
                               25. In your JSON job specification, set  (fram-
                               erateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumera-
                               tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Telecine -> (string)
                               When you do frame rate conversion  from  23.976
                               frames  per second (fps) to 29.97 fps, and your
                               output scan type is interlaced, you can option-
                               ally  enable  hard  telecine (HARD) to create a
                               smoother picture. When  you  keep  the  default
                               value,  None  (NONE), MediaConvert does a stan-
                               dard frame rate conversion to 29.97 without do-
                               ing  anything with the field polarity to create
                               a smoother picture.

                            Vc3Class -> (string)
                               Specify the VC3 class  to  choose  the  quality
                               characteristics for this output. VC3 class, to-
                               gether with  the  settings  Framerate  (framer-
                               ateNumerator and framerateDenominator) and Res-
                               olution (height and width), determine your out-
                               put  bitrate.  For example, say that your video
                               resolution is 1920x1080 and your  framerate  is
                               29.97.  Then Class 145 (CLASS_145) gives you an
                               output with a bitrate of approximately 145 Mbps
                               and  Class 220 (CLASS_220) gives you and output
                               with a bitrate of approximately 220  Mbps.  VC3
                               class  also  specifies  the  color bit depth of
                               your output.

                        Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VP8.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, en-
                               ter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as   a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating  your
                               transcoding job specification as  a  JSON  file
                               without  the  console,  use FramerateControl to
                               specify which value the service  uses  for  the
                               frame  rate  for  this  output. Choose INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to  use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED

                               you  specify in the settings FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame

                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best  conversion  method  frame  by frame. Note
                               that using FrameFormer increases the  transcod-

                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-

                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must
                               be greater than zero.

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer model)  in
                               bits.  For  example,  enter  five  megabits  as
                               5000000.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Ignore this setting unless you set  qualityTun-
                               ingLevel  to  MULTI_PASS. Optional. Specify the
                               maximum bitrate in  bits/second.  For  example,
                               enter  five megabits per second as 5000000. The
                               default behavior uses twice the target  bitrate
                               as the maximum bitrate.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional.  Specify  how  the service determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) for  this  output.
                               The  default  behavior, Follow source (INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR from your  input
                               video  for  your output. To specify a different
                               PAR in the console, choose any value other than
                               Follow  source.  To  specify a different PAR by
                               editing  the  JSON  job  specification,  choose
                               SPECIFIED.  When  you choose SPECIFIED for this
                               setting, you must also specify values  for  the
                               parNumerator and parDenominator settings.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how you want to  trade  off
                               encoding  speed  for  output video quality. The
                               default  behavior  is  faster,  lower  quality,
                               multi-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               With  the VP8 codec, you can use only the vari-
                               able bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                        Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value VP9.

                            Bitrate -> (integer)
                               Target bitrate in bits/second. For example, en-
                               ter five megabits per second as 5000000.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If you are using the console, use the Framerate
                               setting to specify the frame rate for this out-
                               put. If you want to keep the same frame rate as
                               the  input  video, choose Follow source. If you
                               want to do  frame  rate  conversion,  choose  a
                               frame  rate  from  the  dropdown list or choose
                               Custom. The framerates shown  in  the  dropdown
                               list  are  decimal approximations of fractions.
                               If you choose Custom, specify your  frame  rate
                               as   a  fraction.  If  you  are  creating  your
                               transcoding job specification as  a  JSON  file
                               without  the  console,  use FramerateControl to
                               specify which value the service  uses  for  the
                               frame  rate  for  this  output. Choose INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE if you want the service to  use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if you want the service to use the  frame  rate
                               you  specify in the settings FramerateNumerator
                               and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use  when  increasing  or  decreasing the frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP)  for numerically simple conversions,
                               such as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically  com-
                               plex  conversions, you can use interpolate (IN-
                               TERPOLATE) to avoid stutter. This results in  a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions,  especially if your source video has al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best  conversion  method  frame  by frame. Note
                               that using FrameFormer increases the  transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator.  When  you use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator to specify
                               the numerator of this fraction. In  this  exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator. When you use the  console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            GopSize -> (double)
                               GOP  Length (keyframe interval) in frames. Must
                               be greater than zero.

                            HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                               Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in bits.  For
                               example, enter five megabits as 5000000.

                            MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                               Ignore  this setting unless you set qualityTun-
                               ingLevel to MULTI_PASS. Optional.  Specify  the
                               maximum  bitrate  in  bits/second. For example,
                               enter five megabits per second as 5000000.  The
                               default  behavior uses twice the target bitrate
                               as the maximum bitrate.

                            ParControl -> (string)
                               Optional. Specify how  the  service  determines
                               the pixel aspect ratio for this output. The de-
                               fault behavior is to use the same pixel  aspect
                               ratio as your input video.

                            ParDenominator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parDenominator is 33.

                            ParNumerator -> (integer)
                               Required  when you set Pixel aspect ratio (par-
                               Control) to SPECIFIED.  On  the  console,  this
                               corresponds  to  any  value  other  than Follow
                               source. When you specify an output pixel aspect
                               ratio  (PAR)  that is different from your input
                               video PAR, provide your output PAR as a  ratio.
                               For  example,  for  D1/DV  NTSC widescreen, you
                               would specify the ratio 40:33. In this example,
                               the value for parNumerator is 40.

                            QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                               Optional. Use Quality tuning level (qualityTun-
                               ingLevel) to choose how you want to  trade  off
                               encoding  speed  for  output video quality. The
                               default  behavior  is  faster,  lower  quality,
                               multi-pass encoding.

                            RateControlMode -> (string)
                               With  the VP9 codec, you can use only the vari-
                               able bitrate (VBR) rate control mode.

                        XavcSettings -> (structure)
                            Required when you set (Codec) under (VideoDescrip-
                            tion)>(CodecSettings) to the value XAVC.

                            AdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               Keep  the  default value, Auto (AUTO), for this
                               setting to have MediaConvert automatically  ap-
                               ply  the  best  types  of quantization for your
                               video content. When  you  want  to  apply  your
                               quantization  settings  manually,  you must set

                               Optional. Choose a  specific  entropy  encoding
                               mode only when you want to override XAVC recom-
                               mendations. If you choose the value auto, Medi-
                               aConvert  uses the mode that the XAVC file for-
                               mat specifies  given  this  output's  operating
                               point.

                            FramerateControl -> (string)
                               If  you  are  using  the console, use the Frame
                               rate setting to specify the frame rate for this
                               output. If you want to keep the same frame rate
                               as the input video, choose  Follow  source.  If
                               you  want to do frame rate conversion, choose a
                               frame rate from the dropdown list. The  framer-
                               ates shown in the dropdown list are decimal ap-
                               proximations of fractions. If you are  creating
                               your  transcoding  job  specification as a JSON
                               file without the console, use  FramerateControl
                               to specify which value the service uses for the
                               frame rate for  this  output.  Choose  INITIAL-
                               IZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the service to use
                               the frame rate from the input. Choose SPECIFIED
                               if  you  want the service to use the frame rate
                               that you specify in the  settings  FramerateNu-
                               merator and FramerateDenominator.

                            FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                               Choose the method that you want MediaConvert to
                               use when increasing  or  decreasing  the  frame
                               rate. We recommend using drop duplicate (DUPLI-
                               CATE_DROP) for numerically simple  conversions,
                               such  as 60 fps to 30 fps. For numerically com-
                               plex conversions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                               TERPOLATE)  to avoid stutter. This results in a
                               smooth picture, but might introduce undesirable
                               video artifacts. For complex frame rate conver-
                               sions, especially if your source video has  al-
                               ready been converted from its original cadence,
                               use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do motion-com-
                               pensated interpolation. FrameFormer chooses the
                               best conversion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                               that  using FrameFormer increases the transcod-
                               ing time and incurs a significant add-on cost.

                            FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                               When you use the API for  transcode  jobs  that
                               use  frame  rate  conversion, specify the frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator to specify
                               the denominator of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 1001 for the value of FramerateDenomi-
                               nator. When you use the console  for  transcode
                               jobs  that  use  frame rate conversion, provide
                               the value as a decimal number for  Frame  rate.
                               In this example, specify 23.976.

                            FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                               When  you  use  the API for transcode jobs that
                               use frame rate conversion,  specify  the  frame
                               rate as a fraction. For example, 24000 / 1001 =
                               23.976 fps. Use FramerateNumerator  to  specify
                               the  numerator  of this fraction. In this exam-
                               ple, use 24000 for the value of FramerateNumer-
                               ator.  When  you  use the console for transcode
                               jobs that use frame  rate  conversion,  provide
                               the value as a decimal number for Framerate. In
                               this example, specify 23.976.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               Specify the XAVC profile for this  output.  For
                               more information, see the Sony documentation at
                               https://www.xavc-info.org/. Note that MediaCon-
                               vert  doesn't support the interlaced video XAVC
                               operating points for XAVC_HD_INTRA_CBG. To cre-
                               ate  an interlaced XAVC output, choose the pro-
                               file XAVC_HD.

                            SlowPal -> (string)
                               Ignore this setting  unless  your  input  frame
                               rate  is  23.976 or 24 frames per second (fps).
                               Enable slow PAL to create a 25  fps  output  by
                               relabeling the video frames and resampling your
                               audio. Note that  enabling  this  setting  will
                               slightly reduce the duration of your video. Re-
                               lated settings: You must also set Frame rate to
                               25.  In your JSON job specification, set (fram-
                               erateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framerateNumera-
                               tor) to 25 and (framerateDenominator) to 1.

                            Softness -> (integer)
                               Ignore  this  setting  unless  your  downstream
                               workflow requires that you specify  it  explic-
                               itly.  Otherwise,  we recommend that you adjust
                               the softness of your output by  using  a  lower
                               value  for the setting Sharpness (sharpness) or
                               by enabling a noise reducer filter (noiseReduc-
                               erFilter).   The  Softness  (softness)  setting
                               specifies the quantization  matrices  that  the
                               encoder  uses.  Keep  the default value, 0, for
                               flat quantization. Choose the value 1 or 16  to
                               use  the default JVT softening quantization ma-
                               tricies from the H.264 specification. Choose  a
                               value  from  17 to 128 to use planar interpola-
                               tion. Increasing values from 17 to  128  result
                               in increasing reduction of high-frequency data.
                               The value 128 results in the softest video.

                            SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                               The best way to set up adaptive quantization is
                               to keep the default value, Auto (AUTO), for the
                               setting Adaptive quantization  (adaptiveQuanti-
                               zation). When you do so, MediaConvert automati-
                               cally applies the best  types  of  quantization
                               for your video content. Include this setting in
                               your  JSON  job  specification  only  when  you
                               choose to change the default value for Adaptive
                               quantization. For this setting,  keep  the  de-
                               fault value, Enabled (ENABLED), to adjust quan-
                               tization within each  frame  based  on  spatial
                               variation  of  content complexity. When you en-
                               able this feature, the encoder uses fewer  bits
                               on  areas that can sustain more distortion with
                               no noticeable visual degradation and uses  more
                               bits  on  areas where any small distortion will
                               be noticeable. For  example,  complex  textured
                               blocks  are  encoded with fewer bits and smooth
                               textured blocks are encoded with more bits. En-
                               abling  this feature will almost always improve
                               your video quality.  Note,  though,  that  this
                               feature  doesn't  take  into  account where the
                               viewer's attention is likely to be. If  viewers
                               are  likely to be focusing their attention on a
                               part of the screen with a lot of  complex  tex-
                               ture, you might choose to disable this feature.
                               Related setting: When you enable spatial  adap-
                               tive  quantization,  set the value for Adaptive

                               on  your content. For homogeneous content, such
                               as cartoons and video games, set it to Low. For
                               content  with  a wider variety of textures, set
                               it to High or Higher.

                               on  areas  of  the frame that aren't moving and
                               uses more bits on complex  objects  with  sharp
                               edges  that  move a lot. For example, this fea-
                               ture improves the readability of  text  tickers
                               on newscasts and scoreboards on sports matches.

                                   (AUTO), for the setting Adaptive  quantiza-
                                   tion  (XavcAdaptiveQuantization).  When you

                                   appears  as a visual flicker that can arise
                                   when the encoder saves bits by copying some
                                   macroblocks many times from frame to frame,
                                   and then refreshes  them  at  the  I-frame.
                                   When  you  enable this setting, the encoder
                                   updates these macroblocks slightly more of-

                                   choose.

                               QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Use Quality tuning level (quali-
                                   tyTuningLevel) to choose how  you  want  to
                                   trade  off  encoding speed for output video
                                   quality. The default  behavior  is  faster,
                                   lower quality, single-pass encoding.

                               Slices -> (integer)
                                   Number  of slices per picture. Must be less
                                   than or equal to the number  of  macroblock
                                   rows  for  progressive  pictures,  and less
                                   than or equal to half the  number  of  mac-
                                   roblock rows for interlaced pictures.

                               Telecine -> (string)
                                   Ignore  this  setting  unless you set Frame
                                   rate (framerateNumerator divided by framer-
                                   ateDenominator)  to  29.970.  If your input
                                   framerate is 23.976,  choose  Hard  (HARD).
                                   Otherwise,  keep  the  default  value  None
                                   (NONE).   For   more    information,    see
                                   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/working-with-telecine-and-inverse-telecine.html.

                     ColorMetadata -> (string)
                        Choose Insert (INSERT) for  this  setting  to  include
                        color  metadata in this output. Choose Ignore (IGNORE)
                        to exclude color metadata from  this  output.  If  you
                        don't specify a value, the service sets this to Insert
                        by default.

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use Cropping selection (crop)  to  specify  the  video
                        area that the service will include in the output video
                        frame.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DropFrameTimecode -> (string)
                        Applies only to 29.97 fps outputs. When  this  feature
                        is  enabled,  the service will use drop-frame timecode
                        on outputs. If it is not possible  to  use  drop-frame
                        timecode, the system will fall back to non-drop-frame.
                        This setting is enabled by default when  Timecode  in-
                        sertion (TimecodeInsertion) is enabled.

                     FixedAfd -> (integer)
                        Applies only if you set AFD Signaling(AfdSignaling) to
                        Fixed (FIXED).  Use  Fixed  (FixedAfd)  to  specify  a
                        four-bit AFD value which the service will write on all
                        frames of this video output.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        Use the Height (Height) setting to  define  the  video
                        resolution  height for this output. Specify in pixels.
                        If you don't provide a value here,  the  service  will
                        use the input height.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement (position) to define the video
                        area in your output frame. The  area  outside  of  the
                        rectangle that you specify here is black.

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     RespondToAfd -> (string)
                        Use  Respond  to AFD (RespondToAfd) to specify how the
                        service changes the video itself in  response  to  AFD
                        values  in the input. * Choose Respond to clip the in-
                        put video frame according to the AFD value, input dis-
                        play  aspect ratio, and output display aspect ratio. *
                        Choose Passthrough to include the input AFD values. Do
                        not  choose this when AfdSignaling is set to (NONE). A
                        preferred implementation of this workflow  is  to  set
                        RespondToAfd to (NONE) and set AfdSignaling to (AUTO).
                        * Choose None to remove all input AFD values from this
                        output.

                     ScalingBehavior -> (string)
                        Specify  how  the  service handles outputs that have a
                        different aspect ratio from the  input  aspect  ratio.
                        Choose  Stretch  to output (STRETCH_TO_OUTPUT) to have
                        the service stretch your video image to fit. Keep  the
                        setting  Default (DEFAULT) to have the service letter-
                        box your video instead.  This  setting  overrides  any
                        value  that  you  specify  for  the  setting Selection
                        placement (position) in this output.

                     Sharpness -> (integer)
                        Use  Sharpness  (Sharpness)  setting  to  specify  the
                        strength  of  anti-aliasing.  This setting changes the
                        width of the anti-alias filter kernel used  for  scal-
                        ing.  Sharpness only applies if your output resolution
                        is different from your  input  resolution.  0  is  the
                        softest  setting, 100 the sharpest, and 50 recommended
                        for most content.

                     TimecodeInsertion -> (string)
                        Applies only to H.264, H.265, MPEG2, and  ProRes  out-
                        puts.  Only  enable  Timecode insertion when the input
                        frame rate is identical to the output frame  rate.  To
                        include  timecodes in this output, set Timecode inser-
                        tion (VideoTimecodeInsertion)  to  PIC_TIMING_SEI.  To
                        leave  them  out,  set it to DISABLED. Default is DIS-
                        ABLED. When the service inserts timecodes in  an  out-
                        put,  by  default, it uses any embedded timecodes from
                        the input. If none are present, the service  will  set
                        the  timecode  for  the first output frame to zero. To
                        change this default behavior, adjust the settings  un-
                        der  Timecode  configuration  (TimecodeConfig). In the
                        console, these settings are located under  Job  >  Job
                        settings  >  Timecode  configuration.  Note - Timecode
                        source under input settings (InputTimecodeSource) does
                        not affect the timecodes that are inserted in the out-
                        put. Source under Job settings >  Timecode  configura-

                     VideoPreprocessors -> (structure)
                        Find  additional transcoding features under Preproces-
                        sors (VideoPreprocessors). Enable the features at each
                        output  individually.  These  features are disabled by
                        default.

                        ColorCorrector -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to convert the color  space  or
                            to  modify properties such as hue and contrast for
                            this   output.   For   more    information,    see

                            Brightness -> (integer)
                               Brightness level.

                            ClipLimits -> (structure)
                               Specify YUV limits and RGB tolerances when  you
                               set  Sample  range  conversion to Limited range
                               clip.

                               MaximumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Maximum RGB color sample  range
                                   tolerance  for  your  output.  MediaConvert
                                   corrects any YUV  values  that,  when  con-
                                   verted  to  RGB, would be outside the upper
                                   tolerance that you specify. Enter an  inte-
                                   ger  from 90 to 105 as an offset percentage
                                   to the maximum possible value. Leave  blank
                                   to  use  the  default  value  100. When you
                                   specify a value for Maximum RGB  tolerance,
                                   you  must  set  Sample  range conversion to
                                   Limited range clip.

                               MaximumYUV -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Maximum YUV color sample limit.
                                   MediaConvert  conforms  any  pixels in your
                                   input above the value that you  specify  to
                                   typical  limited range bounds. Enter an in-
                                   teger from 920 to 1023. Leave blank to  use
                                   the  default  value 940. The value that you
                                   enter applies to 10-bit ranges.  For  8-bit
                                   ranges,  MediaConvert  automatically scales
                                   this value down. When you specify  a  value
                                   for  Maximum YUV, you must set Sample range
                                   conversion to Limited range clip.

                               MinimumRGBTolerance -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Minimum RGB color sample  range
                                   tolerance  for  your  output.  MediaConvert
                                   corrects any YUV  values  that,  when  con-
                                   verted  to  RGB, would be outside the lower
                                   tolerance that you specify. Enter an  inte-
                                   ger  from  -5 to 10 as an offset percentage
                                   to the minimum possible value. Leave  blank
                                   to  use the default value 0. When you spec-
                                   ify a value for Minimum RGB tolerance,  you
                                   must set Sample range conversion to Limited
                                   range clip.

                               MinimumYUV -> (integer)
                                   Specify the Minimum YUV color sample limit.
                                   MediaConvert  conforms  any  pixels in your
                                   input below the value that you  specify  to
                                   typical  limited range bounds. Enter an in-
                                   teger from 0 to 128. Leave blank to use the
                                   default  value 64. The value that you enter
                                   applies to 10-bit ranges. For 8-bit ranges,
                                   MediaConvert   automatically   scales  this
                                   value down. When you specify  a  value  for
                                   Minumum YUV, you must set Sample range con-
                                   version to Limited range clip.

                            ColorSpaceConversion -> (string)

                               The  mode that you select represents a creative
                               choice, with different tradeoffs in the details
                               and  tones  of your output. To maintain details
                               in bright or saturated areas  of  your  output:
                               Choose Preserve details. For some sources, your
                               SDR output may look less bright and less  satu-
                               rated  when compared to your HDR source. Media-
                               Convert automatically applies this mode for HLG
                               sources,  regardless  of  your  choice.  For  a

                               recommend that you choose this mode when any of
                               your source content is HDR10, and for the  best
                               results  when it is mastered for 1000 nits. You

                               ple  range for this output. To create a limited
                               range output from a full  range  input:  Choose
                               Limited  range  squeeze. For full range inputs,
                               MediaConvert performs a linear offset to  color
                               samples  equally  across all pixels and frames.
                               Color samples in 10-bit outputs are limited  to
                               64  through  940, and 8-bit outputs are limited
                               to 16 through 235. Note: For limited range  in-
                               puts,  values  for  color  samples  are  passed
                               through to your output unchanged.  MediaConvert
                               does  not  limit  the  sample range. To correct
                               pixels in your input that are out of  range  or
                               out  of  gamut:  Choose Limited range clip. Use
                               for broadcast applications.  MediaConvert  con-
                               forms any pixels outside of the values that you
                               specify under Minimum YUV and  Maximum  YUV  to
                               limited  range  bounds.  MediaConvert also cor-
                               rects any YUV values that,  when  converted  to
                               RGB,  would  be  outside the bounds you specify
                               under Minimum RGB  tolerance  and  Maximum  RGB
                               tolerance.  With  either  limited range conver-
                               sion,  MediaConvert  writes  the  sample  range
                               metadata in the output.

                            Saturation -> (integer)
                               Saturation level.

                            SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                               Specify the reference white level, in nits, for
                               all of your SDR inputs. Use to correct  bright-
                               ness levels within HDR10 outputs. The following
                               color metadata must be present in your SDR  in-
                               put: color primaries, transfer characteristics,
                               and matrix coefficients. If your SDR input  has
                               missing  color metadata, or if you want to cor-
                               rect input color metadata, manually  specify  a
                               color  space  in  the input video selector. For
                               1,000 nit peak brightness displays,  we  recom-
                               mend  that you set SDR reference white level to
                               203 (according to ITU-R BT.2408).  Leave  blank
                               to  use the default value of 100, or specify an
                               integer from 100 to 1000.

                            Algorithm -> (string)
                               Only  applies  when you set Deinterlacer (Dein-
                               terlaceMode) to  Deinterlace  (DEINTERLACE)  or
                               Adaptive  (ADAPTIVE).  Motion adaptive interpo-
                               late (INTERPOLATE) produces  sharper  pictures,
                               while  blend  (BLEND) produces smoother motion.
                               Use (INTERPOLATE_TICKER) OR  (BLEND_TICKER)  if
                               your  source  file includes a ticker, such as a
                               scrolling headline at the bottom of the frame.

                            Control -> (string)

                               o When set to NORMAL  (default),  the  deinter-
                                 lacer does not convert frames that are tagged
                                 in metadata as progressive. It will only con-
                                 vert  those  that  are  tagged  as some other
                                 type. - When  set  to  FORCE_ALL_FRAMES,  the
                                 deinterlacer converts every frame to progres-
                                 sive - even those that are already tagged  as
                                 progressive. Turn Force mode on only if there
                                 is a good chance that the metadata has tagged
                                 frames  as progressive when they are not pro-
                                 gressive. Do not turn on otherwise;  process-
                                 ing  frames that are already progressive into
                                 progressive will  probably  result  in  lower
                                 quality video.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               Use  Deinterlacer  (DeinterlaceMode)  to choose
                               how the service will do deinterlacing.  Default
                               is  Deinterlace.  - Deinterlace converts inter-
                               laced to progressive. - Inverse  telecine  con-
                               verts   Hard  Telecine  29.97i  to  progressive
                               23.976p. - Adaptive auto-detects  and  converts
                               to progressive.

                        DolbyVision -> (structure)
                            Enable  Dolby  Vision feature to produce Dolby Vi-
                            sion compatible video output.

                            L6Metadata -> (structure)
                               Use these settings when  you  set  DolbyVision-
                               Level6Mode  to  SPECIFY  to override the MaxCLL
                               and MaxFALL values in your input with new  val-
                               ues.

                               MaxCll -> (integer)
                                   Maximum  Content  Light  Level.  Static HDR
                                   metadata that corresponds to the  brightest
                                   pixel  in  the  entire  stream. Measured in
                                   nits.

                               MaxFall -> (integer)
                                   Maximum Frame-Average Light  Level.  Static
                                   HDR  metadata that corresponds to the high-
                                   est frame-average brightness in the  entire
                                   stream. Measured in nits.

                            L6Mode -> (string)
                               Use Dolby Vision Mode to choose how the service
                               will handle Dolby  Vision  MaxCLL  and  MaxFALL
                               properies.

                            Mapping -> (string)
                               Required  when  you set Dolby Vision Profile to
                               Profile 8.1. When you set  Content  mapping  to
                               None,  content  mapping  is  not applied to the
                               HDR10-compatible  signal.  Depending   on   the
                               source  peak nit level, clipping might occur on
                               HDR devices without Dolby Vision. When you  set
                               Content  mapping  to HDR10 1000, the transcoder
                               creates a 1,000 nits peak HDR10-compatible sig-
                               nal  by  applying static content mapping to the
                               source. This mode is speed-optimized  for  PQ10
                               sources  with  metadata  that  is  created from
                               analysis. For graded Dolby Vision  content,  be
                               aware that creative intent might not be guaran-
                               teed with extreme 1,000 nits trims.

                            Profile -> (string)
                               Required when you enable Dolby Vision. Use Pro-
                               file  5  to include frame-interleaved Dolby Vi-
                               sion metadata in your output. Your  input  must
                               include  Dolby  Vision metadata or an HDR10 YUV
                               color  space.  Use  Profile  8.1   to   include
                               frame-interleaved  Dolby  Vision  metadata  and
                               HDR10 metadata in your output. Your input  must
                               include Dolby Vision metadata.

                        Hdr10Plus -> (structure)
                            Enable HDR10+ analyis and metadata injection. Com-
                            patible with HEVC only.

                            MasteringMonitorNits -> (integer)
                               Specify the HDR10+ mastering display normalized
                               peak luminance, in nits. This is the normalized
                               actual peak luminance of the mastering display,
                               as defined by ST 2094-40.

                            TargetMonitorNits -> (integer)
                               Specify  the HDR10+ target display nominal peak
                               luminance, in nits. This is the nominal maximum
                               luminance  of  the target display as defined by
                               ST 2094-40.

                        ImageInserter -> (structure)
                            Enable the Image inserter (ImageInserter)  feature
                            to include a graphic overlay on your video. Enable
                            or disable this feature for each output  individu-
                            ally. This setting is disabled by default.

                            InsertableImages -> (list)
                               Specify  the images that you want to overlay on
                               your video. The  images  must  be  PNG  or  TGA
                               files.

                               (structure)
                                   These  settings apply to a specific graphic
                                   overlay. You can include multiple  overlays
                                   in your job.

                                   Duration -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  time, in milliseconds, for
                                      the image to remain on the output video.
                                      This  duration includes fade-in time but
                                      not fade-out time.

                                   FadeIn -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds,  between  the  Start time that you
                                      specify for the image insertion and  the
                                      time  that  the  image  appears  at full
                                      opacity. Full opacity is the level  that
                                      you  specify for the opacity setting. If
                                      you don't specify a value  for  Fade-in,
                                      the  image  will  appear abruptly at the
                                      overlay start time.

                                   FadeOut -> (integer)
                                      Specify the length of time, in millisec-
                                      onds,  between  the end of the time that
                                      you have specified for the image overlay
                                      Duration and when the overlaid image has
                                      faded  to  total  transparency.  If  you
                                      don't  specify a value for Fade-out, the
                                      image will disappear abruptly at the end
                                      of the inserted image duration.

                                   Height -> (integer)
                                      Specify the height of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger than the video resolution height,
                                      the service will crop your overlaid  im-
                                      age  to fit. To use the native height of
                                      the image, keep this setting blank.

                                   ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                      Specify the HTTP, HTTPS,  or  Amazon  S3
                                      location  of  the image that you want to
                                      overlay on the video. Use a PNG  or  TGA
                                      file.

                                   ImageX -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the inserted image and the left edge  of
                                      the  video frame. Required for any image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   ImageY -> (integer)
                                      Specify the distance, in pixels, between
                                      the  overlaid  image and the top edge of
                                      the video frame. Required for any  image
                                      overlay that you specify.

                                   Layer -> (integer)
                                      Specify  how overlapping inserted images
                                      appear. Images with  higher  values  for
                                      Layer appear on top of images with lower
                                      values for Layer.

                                   Opacity -> (integer)
                                      Use Opacity  (Opacity)  to  specify  how
                                      much   of  the  underlying  video  shows
                                      through the inserted image. 0 is  trans-
                                      parent  and 100 is fully opaque. Default
                                      is 50.

                                   StartTime -> (string)
                                      Specify the timecode of the  frame  that
                                      you want the overlay to first appear on.
                                      This must be in timecode (HH:MM:SS:FF or
                                      HH:MM:SS;FF)  format.  Remember  to take
                                      into account your timecode  source  set-
                                      tings.

                                   Width -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the width of the inserted image
                                      in pixels. If you specify a value that's
                                      larger  than the video resolution width,
                                      the service will crop your overlaid  im-
                                      age  to  fit. To use the native width of
                                      the image, keep this setting blank.

                            SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                               Specify the reference white level, in nits, for
                               all  of your image inserter images. Use to cor-
                               rect brightness levels  within  HDR10  outputs.

                        NoiseReducer -> (structure)
                            Enable  the  Noise reducer feature to remove noise
                            from your video output  if  necessary.  Enable  or
                            disable this feature for each output individually.
                            This setting is disabled by default. When you  en-
                            able  Noise  reducer, you must also select a value
                            for Noise reducer filter. For  AVC  outputs,  when
                            you  include Noise reducer, you cannot include the
                            Bandwidth reduction filter.

                            Filter -> (string)
                               Use Noise reducer  filter  (NoiseReducerFilter)
                               to  select  one  of the following spatial image
                               filtering functions. To use this  setting,  you
                               must  also enable Noise reducer (NoiseReducer).

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Relative strength of noise reducing filter.
                                   Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                            SpatialFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Noise  reducer filter settings for spatial fil-
                               ter.

                               PostFilterSharpenStrength -> (integer)
                                   Specify strength of  post  noise  reduction
                                   sharpening  filter,  with  0  disabling the
                                   filter  and  3  enabling  it   at   maximum
                                   strength.

                               Speed -> (integer)
                                   The  speed  of  the  filter, from -2 (lower
                                   speed) to 3 (higher speed),  with  0  being
                                   the nominal value.

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Relative strength of noise reducing filter.
                                   Higher values produce stronger filtering.

                            TemporalFilterSettings -> (structure)
                               Noise reducer filter settings for temporal fil-
                               ter.

                               AggressiveMode -> (integer)
                                   Use  Aggressive  mode  for content that has
                                   complex  motion.  Higher   values   produce
                                   stronger  temporal  filtering. This filters
                                   highly complex scenes more aggressively and
                                   creates better VQ for low bitrate outputs.

                               PostTemporalSharpening -> (string)
                                   When  you  set Noise reducer (noiseReducer)
                                   to Temporal (TEMPORAL), the  bandwidth  and
                                   sharpness  of  your  output is reduced. You
                                   can optionally use Post temporal sharpening
                                   (postTemporalSharpening)  to apply sharpen-
                                   ing to the edges of your output. Note  that
                                   Post temporal sharpening will also make the
                                   bandwidth reduction from the Noise  reducer
                                   smaller. The default behavior, Auto (AUTO),
                                   allows the transcoder to determine  whether
                                   to  apply sharpening, depending on your in-
                                   put type and quality.  When  you  set  Post
                                   temporal  sharpening  to Enabled (ENABLED),
                                   specify how much sharpening is applied  us-
                                   ing   Post   temporal  sharpening  strength
                                   (postTemporalSharpeningStrength). Set  Post
                                   temporal  sharpening to Disabled (DISABLED)
                                   to not apply sharpening.

                               PostTemporalSharpeningStrength -> (string)
                                   Use  Post  temporal   sharpening   strength
                                   (postTemporalSharpeningStrength)  to define
                                   the amount of sharpening the transcoder ap-
                                   plies  to  your  output.  Set Post temporal
                                   sharpening strength to  Low  (LOW),  Medium
                                   (MEDIUM),  or  High  (HIGH) to indicate the
                                   amount of sharpening.

                               Speed -> (integer)
                                   The speed of the filter (higher  number  is
                                   faster).  Low  setting  reduces bit rate at
                                   the cost of transcode  time,  high  setting
                                   improves  transcode time at the cost of bit
                                   rate.

                               Strength -> (integer)
                                   Specify the strength of the noise  reducing
                                   filter  on  this output. Higher values pro-
                                   duce stronger filtering. We  recommend  the
                                   following  value  ranges,  depending on the
                                   result that you want: * 0-2 for  complexity
                                   reduction with minimal sharpness loss * 2-8
                                   for complexity reduction with image preser-
                                   vation  * 8-16 for a high level of complex-
                                   ity reduction

                        PartnerWatermarking -> (structure)
                            If you work with a third party video  watermarking
                            partner, use the group of settings that correspond
                            with your watermarking partner to  include  water-
                            marks in your output.

                               supports Nagra NexGuard File Marker  watermark-
                               ing. MediaConvert supports both PreRelease Con-
                               tent (NGPR/G2) and OTT Streaming workflows.

                               License -> (string)
                                   Use the base64 license  string  that  Nagra
                                   provides  you.  Enter  it  directly in your
                                   JSON job specification or in  the  console.
                                   Required  when  you  include Nagra NexGuard
                                   File  Marker  watermarking  (NexGuardWater-
                                   markingSettings) in your job.

                               Payload -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the payload ID that you want asso-
                                   ciated with this output. Valid values  vary
                                   depending  on  your Nagra NexGuard forensic
                                   watermarking workflow.  Required  when  you
                                   include  Nagra  NexGuard File Marker water-
                                   marking  (NexGuardWatermarkingSettings)  in
                                   your job. For PreRelease Content (NGPR/G2),
                                   specify   an   integer   from   1   through
                                   4,194,303.  You  must  generate a unique ID
                                   for each asset you watermark,  and  keep  a
                                   record  of  which  ID  you have assigned to
                                   each asset. Neither Nagra nor  MediaConvert
                                   keep track of the relationship between out-
                                   put files and your IDs. For OTT  Streaming,
                                   create  two  adaptive  bitrate (ABR) stacks
                                   for each asset. Do this by setting  up  two
                                   output  groups.  For  one output group, set
                                   the value of Payload ID (payload) to  0  in
                                   every  output.  For the other output group,
                                   set Payload ID (payload) to 1 in every out-
                                   put.

                               Preset -> (string)
                                   Enter   one   of  the  watermarking  preset
                                   strings that Nagra provides  you.  Required
                                   when you include Nagra NexGuard File Marker
                                   watermarking (NexGuardWatermarkingSettings)
                                   in your job.

                               Strength -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Ignore this setting unless Nagra
                                   support directs you  to  specify  a  value.
                                   When  you  don't  specify a value here, the
                                   Nagra NexGuard  library  uses  its  default
                                   value.

                        TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                            Settings for burning the output timecode and spec-
                            ified prefix into the output.

                            FontSize -> (integer)
                               Use Font Size (FontSize) to set the  font  size
                               of any burned-in timecode. Valid values are 10,
                               16, 32, 48.

                            Position -> (string)
                               Use Position (Position)  under  under  Timecode
                               burn-in  (TimecodeBurnIn)  to specify the loca-
                               tion the burned-in timecode on output video.

                            Prefix -> (string)
                               Use Prefix (Prefix) to place  ASCII  characters
                               before  any  burned-in timecode. For example, a
                               prefix of "EZ-" will  result  in  the  timecode
                               "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the characters
                               themselves or the ASCII code  equivalents.  The
                               supported  range  of characters is 0x20 through
                               0x7e. This includes letters, numbers,  and  all
                               special  characters  represented  on a standard
                               English keyboard.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        Use Width  (Width)  to  define  the  video  resolution
                        width,  in  pixels, for this output. If you don't pro-
                        vide a value here, the  service  will  use  the  input
                        width.

              Type -> (string)
                 A  preset  can  be  of two types: system or custom. System or
                 built-in preset can't be modified or deleted by the user.
