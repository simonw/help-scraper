OPTIONS
       --id (string) the job ID of the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get details for a particular job

       The  following  example  requests  the  information for the job with ID
       1234567890987-1ab2c3, which in this example ended in an error.

          aws mediaconvert get-job \
              --endpoint-url https://abcd1234.mediaconvert.region-name-1.amazonaws.com \
              --region region-name-1 \
              --id 1234567890987-1ab2c3

       To get your account-specific endpoint, use describe-endpoints, or  send
       the command without the endpoint. The service returns an error and your
       endpoint.

       If your request is successful, the service returns a JSON file with job
       information, including job settings, any returned errors, and other job
       data, as follows:

          {
              "Job": {
                  "Status": "ERROR",
                  "Queue": "arn:aws:mediaconvert:region-name-1:012345678998:queues/Queue1",

                  },
                  "ErrorMessage": "Unable to open input file [s3://my-input-bucket/file-name.mp4]: [Failed probe/open: [Failed to read data: AssumeRole failed]]",
                  "ErrorCode": 1434,

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          Each  job  converts  an input file into an output file or files. For
          more     information,      see      the      User      Guide      at
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

          AccelerationSettings -> (structure)
              Accelerated  transcoding  can  significantly  speed up jobs with
              long, visually complex content.

              Mode -> (string)
                 Specify the conditions when the service  will  run  your  job
                 with accelerated transcoding.

          AccelerationStatus -> (string)
              Describes  whether  the  current job is running with accelerated
              transcoding. For jobs that have Acceleration  (AccelerationMode)
              set  to  DISABLED,  AccelerationStatus is always NOT_APPLICABLE.
              For jobs that have Acceleration (AccelerationMode)  set  to  EN-
              ABLED  or  PREFERRED,  AccelerationStatus  is  one  of the other
              states. AccelerationStatus is IN_PROGRESS initially,  while  the
              service  determines whether the input files and job settings are
              compatible with accelerated transcoding. If they  are,  Acclera-
              tionStatus  is ACCELERATED. If your input files and job settings
              aren't compatible with accelerated transcoding, the service  ei-
              ther  fails your job or runs it without accelerated transcoding,
              depending on how you set Acceleration  (AccelerationMode).  When
              the  service  runs your job without accelerated transcoding, Ac-
              celerationStatus is NOT_ACCELERATED.

          Arn -> (string)
              An identifier for this resource that is  unique  within  all  of
              AWS.

          BillingTagsSource -> (string)
              The  tag  type  that AWS Billing and Cost Management will use to
              sort your AWS Elemental MediaConvert costs on any billing report
              that you set up.

          CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time, in Unix epoch format in seconds, when the job got cre-
              ated.

          CurrentPhase -> (string)
              A job's phase can be PROBING, TRANSCODING OR UPLOADING

          ErrorCode -> (integer)
              Error code for the job

          ErrorMessage -> (string)
              Error message of Job

          HopDestinations -> (list)
              Optional list of hop destinations.

              (structure)
                 Optional. Configuration for a destination queue to which  the
                 job  can  hop  once  a customer-defined minimum wait time has
                 passed.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Optional. When you set up a job to use queue hopping, you
                     can  specify a different relative priority for the job in
                     the destination queue. If you don't specify, the relative
                     priority will remain the same as in the previous queue.

                 Queue -> (string)
                     Optional  unless  the  job  is  submitted  on the default
                     queue. When you set up a job to use  queue  hopping,  you
                     can specify a destination queue. This queue cannot be the
                     original queue to which the  job  is  submitted.  If  the
                     original  queue  isn't  the  default  queue and you don't
                     specify the destination queue, the job will move  to  the
                     default queue.

                 WaitMinutes -> (integer)
                     Required for setting up a job to use queue hopping. Mini-
                     mum wait time in minutes until the job  can  hop  to  the
                     destination  queue. Valid range is 1 to 1440 minutes, in-
                     clusive.

          Id -> (string)
              A portion of the job's ARN, unique within your AWS Elemental Me-
              diaConvert resources

          JobPercentComplete -> (integer)
              An estimate of how far your job has progressed. This estimate is
              shown as a percentage of the  total  time  from  when  your  job
              leaves its queue to when your output files appear in your output
              Amazon S3 bucket. AWS Elemental  MediaConvert  provides  jobPer-
              centComplete  in  CloudWatch STATUS_UPDATE events and in the re-
              sponse to GetJob and ListJobs requests.  The  jobPercentComplete
              estimate  is reliable for the following input containers: Quick-
              time, Transport Stream, MP4, and MXF. For some jobs, the service
              can't  provide  information  about job progress. In those cases,
              jobPercentComplete returns a null value.

          JobTemplate -> (string)
              The job template that the job is created from, if it is  created
              from a job template.

          Messages -> (structure)
              Provides  messages from the service about jobs that you have al-
              ready successfully submitted.

              Info -> (list)
                 List of messages that are informational only and don't  indi-
                 cate a problem with your job.

          Priority -> (integer)
              Relative priority on the job.

          Queue -> (string)
              When you create a job, you can specify a queue to send it to. If
              you don't specify, the job will go to  the  default  queue.  For
              more    about    queues,   see   the   User   Guide   topic   at
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/what-is.html

                 Settings for ad avail blanking. Video can be blanked or over-
                 laid  with an image, and audio muted during SCTE-35 triggered
                 ad avails.

                 AvailBlankingImage -> (string)
                     Blanking image to be used. Leave empty for  solid  black.
                     Only bmp and png images are supported.

              Esam -> (structure)
                 Settings  for  Event  Signaling  And Messaging (ESAM). If you
                 don't do ad insertion, you can ignore these settings.

                 ManifestConfirmConditionNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies  an  ESAM  ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                     XML as per OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses
                     the manifest conditioning instructions that  you  provide
                     in the setting MCC XML (mccXml).

                     MccXml -> (string)
                        Provide your ESAM ManifestConfirmConditionNotification
                        XML document inside your JSON job settings.  Form  the
                        XML  document  as  per  OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The
                        transcoder will use the Manifest Conditioning instruc-
                        tions in the message that you supply.

                 ResponseSignalPreroll -> (integer)
                     Specifies  the  stream distance, in milliseconds, between
                     the SCTE 35 messages that the transcoder places  and  the
                     splice points that they refer to. If the time between the
                     start of the asset and the SCTE-35 message is  less  than
                     this value, then the transcoder places the SCTE-35 marker
                     at the beginning of the stream.

                 SignalProcessingNotification -> (structure)
                     Specifies an ESAM SignalProcessingNotification XML as per
                     OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025. The transcoder uses the signal
                     processing instructions that you provide in  the  setting
                     SCC XML (sccXml).

                     SccXml -> (string)
                        Provide  your  ESAM  SignalProcessingNotification  XML
                        document inside your JSON job settings. Form  the  XML
                        document   as   per   OC-SP-ESAM-API-I03-131025.   The
                        transcoder will use the signal processing instructions
                        in the message that you supply. Provide your ESAM Sig-
                        nalProcessingNotification  XML  document  inside  your
                        JSON  job settings. For your MPEG2-TS file outputs, if
                        you want the service to place SCTE-35 markers  at  the
                        insertion  points you specify in the XML document, you
                        must also enable SCTE-35 ESAM (scte35Esam). Note  that
                        you  can either specify an ESAM XML document or enable
                        SCTE-35 passthrough. You can't do both.

              ExtendedDataServices -> (structure)
                 If your source content has EIA-608 Line 21 Data Services, en-
                 able  this feature to specify what MediaConvert does with the
                 Extended Data Services (XDS) packets. You can choose to  pass

                 CopyProtectionAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on copy and redistribution control XDS
                     packets. If you select PASSTHROUGH, packets will  not  be
                     changed. If you select STRIP, any packets will be removed
                     in output captions.

                 VchipAction -> (string)
                     The action to take on content advisory  XDS  packets.  If
                     you  select  PASSTHROUGH, packets will not be changed. If
                     you select STRIP, any packets will be removed  in  output
                     captions.

              Inputs -> (list)
                 Use  Inputs  (inputs)  to  define  source  file  used  in the
                 transcode job. There can be multiple inputs  add  in  a  job.
                 These  inputs  will  be  concantenated together to create the
                 output.

                 (structure)
                     Use inputs to  define  the  source  files  used  in  your
                     transcoding    job.    For    more    information,    see

                     AudioSelectorGroups -> (map)
                        Use audio selector groups to combine multiple  sidecar
                        audio  inputs  so that you can assign them to a single
                        output audio tab  (AudioDescription).  Note  that,  if
                        you're  working  with  embedded audio, it's simpler to
                        assign multiple input tracks into a single  audio  se-
                        lector rather than use an audio selector group.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  audio  selector  groups  to  combine multiple
                            sidecar audio inputs so that you can  assign  them
                            to  a  single output audio tab (AudioDescription).
                            Note that, if you're working with embedded  audio,
                            it's  simpler to assign multiple input tracks into
                            a single audio selector rather than use  an  audio
                            selector group.

                            AudioSelectorNames -> (list)
                               Name of an Audio Selector within the same input
                               to include in the group. Audio  selector  names
                               are  standardized,  based on their order within
                               the input (e.g., "Audio Selector 1"). The audio
                               selector  name parameter can be repeated to add
                               any number of audio selectors to the group.

                               (string)

                     AudioSelectors -> (map)
                        Use Audio  selectors  (AudioSelectors)  to  specify  a
                        track  or  set  of tracks from the input that you will
                        use in your outputs. You can use multiple Audio selec-
                        tors per input.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Use  Audio selectors (AudioSelectors) to specify a
                            track or set of tracks from  the  input  that  you
                            will use in your outputs. You can use multiple Au-
                            dio selectors per input.

                            AudioDurationCorrection -> (string)
                               Apply audio timing corrections to help synchro-
                               nize  audio  and video in your output. To apply
                               timing corrections, your input  must  meet  the
                               following  requirements:  *  Container: MP4, or
                               MOV, with an accurate time-to-sample (STTS) ta-
                               ble.  *  Audio track: AAC. Choose from the fol-
                               lowing audio timing correction settings: * Dis-
                               abled  (Default):  Apply no correction. * Auto:
                               Recommended for most inputs. MediaConvert  ana-
                               lyzes the audio timing in your input and deter-
                               mines  which  correction  setting  to  use,  if
                               needed.  *  Track:  Adjust the duration of each
                               audio frame by a constant amount to  align  the
                               audio   track   length   with   STTS  duration.
                               Track-level correction does not  affect  pitch,
                               and is recommended for tonal audio content such
                               as music. * Frame: Adjust the duration of  each
                               audio frame by a variable amount to align audio
                               frames with STTS timestamps. No corrections are
                               made  to  already-aligned  frames.  Frame-level
                               correction may affect the  pitch  of  corrected
                               frames,  and  is  recommended  for atonal audio
                               content such as speech or percussion.

                            CustomLanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio  source, using the ISO 639-2 or ISO 639-3
                               three-letter language code

                            DefaultSelection -> (string)
                               Enable this setting on one  audio  selector  to
                               set  it as the default for the job. The service
                               uses this default for outputs  where  it  can't
                               find  the  specified  input audio. If you don't
                               set a default, those outputs have no audio.

                            ExternalAudioFileInput -> (string)
                               Specifies audio  data  from  an  external  file
                               source.

                            HlsRenditionGroupSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  specific  to  audio sources in an HLS
                               alternate rendition group. Specify the  proper-
                               ties (renditionGroupId, renditionName or rendi-
                               tionLanguageCode) to identify the unique  audio
                               track  among  the  alternative rendition groups
                               present in the HLS manifest. If no unique track
                               is  found, or multiple tracks match the proper-
                               ties provided, the job fails. If no  properties
                               in hlsRenditionGroupSettings are specified, the
                               default audio track within the video segment is
                               chosen.  If there is no audio within video seg-
                               ment, the alternative audio with DEFAULT=YES is
                               chosen instead.

                               RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                               RenditionLanguageCode -> (string)
                                   Optional.  Specify  ISO  639-2 or ISO 639-3
                                   code in the language property

                               RenditionName -> (string)
                                   Optional. Specify media name

                            LanguageCode -> (string)
                               Selects a specific language code from within an
                               audio source.

                            Offset -> (integer)
                               Specifies  a time delta in milliseconds to off-
                               set the audio from the input video.

                            Pids -> (list)
                               Selects a specific PID  from  within  an  audio
                               source (e.g. 257 selects PID 0x101).

                               (integer)

                            ProgramSelection -> (integer)
                               Use this setting for input streams that contain
                               Dolby E, to have the service  extract  specific
                               program data from the track. To select multiple
                               programs, create multiple  selectors  with  the
                               same  Track  and  different Program numbers. In
                               the console, this setting is visible  when  you
                               set  Selector type to Track. Choose the program
                               number from the dropdown list. If you are send-
                               ing  a JSON file, provide the program ID, which
                               is part of the audio metadata.  If  your  input
                               file has incorrect metadata, you can choose All
                               channels instead of a program  number  to  have
                               the  service ignore the program IDs and include
                               all the programs in the track.

                            RemixSettings -> (structure)
                               Use these settings to reorder the  audio  chan-
                               nels of one input to match those of another in-
                               put. This allows you to combine the  two  files
                               into a single output, one after the other.

                               ChannelMapping -> (structure)
                                   Channel  mapping  (ChannelMapping) contains
                                   the group of fields that hold the  remixing
                                   value  for  each  channel,  in  dB. Specify
                                   remix values to indicate how  much  of  the
                                   content  from  your input audio channel you
                                   want in your output  audio  channels.  Each
                                   instance of the InputChannels or InputChan-
                                   nelsFineTune array specifies  these  values
                                   for one output channel. Use one instance of
                                   this array for each output channel. In  the
                                   console, each array corresponds to a column
                                   in the graphical depiction of  the  mapping
                                   matrix.  The  rows  of the graphical matrix
                                   correspond to input channels. Valid  values
                                   are   within  the  range  from  -60  (mute)
                                   through 6. A setting of 0 passes the  input
                                   channel unchanged to the output channel (no
                                   attenuation  or  amplification).  Use   In-
                                   putChannels   or  InputChannelsFineTune  to
                                   specify your remix values. Don't use both.

                                   OutputChannels -> (list)
                                      In your JSON job specification,  include
                                      one child of OutputChannels for each au-
                                      dio channel that you want in  your  out-
                                      put.  Each  child should contain one in-
                                      stance of  InputChannels  or  InputChan-
                                      nelsFineTune.

                                             Use  this setting to specify your
                                             remix values  when  they  have  a
                                             decimal    component,   such   as
                                             -10.312, 0.08, or 4.9.  MediaCon-

                               ChannelsIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify the number of audio  channels  from
                                   your  input  that  you  want to use in your

                                   number of channels  in  your  final  output
                                   might  be  different. If you are doing both
                                   input channel mapping  and  output  channel
                                   mapping,  the  number of output channels in
                                   your input mapping must be the same as  the
                                   number  of  input  channels  in your output
                                   mapping.

                                   put  after remixing. Valid values: 1, 2, 4,
                                   6, 8... 64. (1 and even numbers to 64.)  If
                                   you  are  doing  both input channel mapping
                                   and output channel mapping, the  number  of
                                   output  channels in your input mapping must
                                   be the same as the number of input channels
                                   in your output mapping.

                            SelectorType -> (string)

                               index  number.  To  include several tracks in a
                               single audio selector, specify multiple  tracks
                               as   follows.   Using   the  console,  enter  a
                               comma-separated list. For examle, type  "1,2,3"
                               to  include  tracks 1 through 3. Specifying di-
                               rectly in your JSON job file, provide the track
                               numbers  in  an  array.  For example, "tracks":

                                      Enter  a  positive or negative number to
                                      modify the times in the  captions  file.
                                      For  example,  type 15 to add 15 seconds
                                      to all the times in the  captions  file.
                                      Type  -5  to subtract 5 seconds from the
                                      times in the captions file. You can  op-

                                      liseconds instead of seconds.  When  you
                                      do  so,  set  the  related setting, Time
                                      delta  units  (TimeDeltaUnits)  to  Mil-
                                      liseconds   (MILLISECONDS).  Note  that,
                                      when you specify a time delta for  time-

                                      est  frame. For example, when your input
                                      video frame rate is 25 fps and you spec-
                                      ify  1010ms for time delta, MediaConvert
                                      delays your captions by 1000 ms.

                                   TimeDeltaUnits -> (string)
                                      When you  use  the  setting  Time  delta
                                      (TimeDelta)  to  adjust the sync between
                                      your sidecar captions  and  your  video,
                                      use  this  setting  to specify the units
                                      for the delta that you specify. When you
                                      don't  specify  a  value  for Time delta
                                      units   (TimeDeltaUnits),   MediaConvert
                                      uses seconds by default.

                               SourceType -> (string)
                                   Use  Source  (SourceType)  to  identify the
                                   format of your input captions. The  service
                                   cannot auto-detect caption format.

                               TeletextSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings   specific   to  Teletext  caption
                                   sources, including Page number.

                                   PageNumber -> (string)
                                      Use Page Number (PageNumber) to  specify
                                      the  three-digit hexadecimal page number
                                      that will be used for Teletext captions.
                                      Do not use this setting if you are pass-
                                      ing  through  teletext  from  the  input
                                      source to output.

                               TrackSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific  to caption sources that
                                   are specified by track  number.  Currently,
                                   this  is only IMSC captions in an IMF pack-
                                   age. If your caption source is IMSC 1.1  in
                                   a separate xml file, use FileSourceSettings
                                   instead of TrackSourceSettings.

                                   TrackNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use this setting to select a single cap-
                                      tions track from a source. Track numbers
                                      correspond to the order in the  captions
                                      source file. For IMF sources, track num-
                                      bering is based on the  order  that  the
                                      captions appear in the CPL. For example,
                                      use 1 to select the captions asset  that
                                      is  listed  first in the CPL. To include
                                      more than one captions track in your job
                                      outputs,  create multiple input captions
                                      selectors. Specify one track per  selec-
                                      tor.

                               WebvttHlsSourceSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings  specific to WebVTT sources in HLS
                                   alternative rendition  group.  Specify  the
                                   properties (renditionGroupId, renditionName
                                   or renditionLanguageCode) to  identify  the
                                   unique subtitle track among the alternative
                                   rendition groups present in the  HLS  mani-
                                   fest.  If no unique track is found, or mul-
                                   tiple tracks match  the  specified  proper-
                                   ties,  the  job fails. If there is only one
                                   subtitle track in the rendition group,  the
                                   settings  can be left empty and the default
                                   subtitle track will be chosen. If your cap-
                                   tion  source  is  a sidecar file, use File-
                                   SourceSettings instead of  WebvttHlsSource-
                                   Settings.

                                   RenditionGroupId -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify alternative group ID

                                   RenditionName -> (string)
                                      Optional. Specify media name

                     Crop -> (structure)
                        Use Cropping selection (crop)  to  specify  the  video
                        area that the service will include in the output video
                        frame. If you specify a value here, it  will  override
                        any value that you specify in the output setting Crop-
                        ping selection (crop).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height of rectangle in pixels. Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width  of  rectangle  in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the  left  edge  of  the video frame. Specify only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     DeblockFilter -> (string)
                        Enable   Deblock   (InputDeblockFilter)   to   produce
                        smoother  motion  in  the output. Default is disabled.
                        Only manually controllable for MPEG2 and  uncompressed
                        video inputs.

                     DecryptionSettings -> (structure)
                        Settings  for  decrypting any input files that you en-
                        crypt before you upload them to Amazon  S3.  MediaCon-
                        vert  can decrypt files only when you use AWS Key Man-
                        agement Service (KMS) to encrypt the data key that you
                        use to encrypt your content.

                        DecryptionMode -> (string)
                            Specify  the  encryption mode that you used to en-
                            crypt your input files.

                        EncryptedDecryptionKey -> (string)
                            Warning! Don't  provide  your  encryption  key  in
                            plaintext. Your job settings could be intercepted,
                            making your encrypted content vulnerable.  Specify
                            the  encrypted  version  of  the data key that you
                            used to encrypt your content. The data key must be
                            encrypted by AWS Key Management Service (KMS). The
                            key can be 128, 192, or 256 bits.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            Specify the initialization vector  that  you  used
                            when  you  encrypted your content before uploading
                            it to Amazon S3. You can use a 16-byte initializa-
                            tion  vector with any encryption mode. Or, you can
                            use a 12-byte initialization vector  with  GCM  or
                            CTR. MediaConvert accepts only initialization vec-
                            tors that are base64-encoded.

                        KmsKeyRegion -> (string)
                            Specify the AWS Region for AWS Key Management Ser-
                            vice (KMS) that you used to encrypt your data key,
                            if that Region is different from the one  you  are
                            using for AWS Elemental MediaConvert.

                     DenoiseFilter -> (string)
                        Enable  Denoise  (InputDenoiseFilter)  to filter noise
                        from the input. Default is disabled.  Only  applicable
                        to MPEG2, H.264, H.265, and uncompressed video inputs.

                     DolbyVisionMetadataXml -> (string)
                        Use this setting only when your video source has Dolby
                        Vision studio mastering metadata that is carried in  a
                        separate  XML file. Specify the Amazon S3 location for
                        the metadata XML file. MediaConvert uses this file  to
                        provide  global and frame-level metadata for Dolby Vi-
                        sion preprocessing. When you specify a file  here  and
                        your input also has interleaved global and frame level
                        metadata, MediaConvert ignores the  interleaved  meta-
                        data and uses only the the metadata from this external
                        XML file. Note that your IAM service role  must  grant
                        MediaConvert  read  permissions to this file. For more
                        information,                                       see

                     FileInput -> (string)
                        Specify the source file for your transcoding job.  You
                        can  use  multiple inputs in a single job. The service
                        concatenates these inputs, in the order that you spec-
                        ify  them  in  the job, to create the outputs. If your
                        input format is IMF, specify your input  by  providing
                        the     path     to    your    CPL.    For    example,
                        "s3://bucket/vf/cpl.xml". If the CPL is in  an  incom-
                        plete IMP, make sure to use Supplemental IMPs (Supple-
                        mentalImps) to specify any supplemental IMPs that con-
                        tain assets referenced by the CPL.

                     FilterEnable -> (string)
                        Specify  how  the  transcoding service applies the de-
                        noise and deblock filters. You must  also  enable  the
                        filters  separately, with Denoise (InputDenoiseFilter)
                        and  Deblock  (InputDeblockFilter).  *  Auto   -   The
                        transcoding  service  determines whether to apply fil-
                        tering, depending on input type and quality. * Disable
                        -  The input is not filtered. This is true even if you
                        use the API to enable them in (InputDeblockFilter) and
                        (InputDeblockFilter).  * Force - The input is filtered
                        regardless of input type.

                     FilterStrength -> (integer)
                        Use Filter strength  (FilterStrength)  to  adjust  the
                        magnitude  the  input filter settings (Deblock and De-
                        noise). The range is -5 to 5. Default is 0.

                     ImageInserter -> (structure)
                        Enable the image inserter feature to include a graphic
                        overlay  on your video. Enable or disable this feature
                        for each input individually. This setting is  disabled
                        by default.

                        InsertableImages -> (list)
                            Specify  the  images  that  you want to overlay on
                            your video. The images must be PNG or TGA files.

                            (structure)
                               These settings  apply  to  a  specific  graphic
                               overlay.  You  can include multiple overlays in
                               your job.

                               Duration -> (integer)
                                   Specify the time, in milliseconds, for  the
                                   image  to  remain on the output video. This
                                   duration  includes  fade-in  time  but  not
                                   fade-out time.

                               FadeIn -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  length  of time, in millisec-
                                   onds, between the Start time that you spec-
                                   ify  for  the  image insertion and the time
                                   that the image  appears  at  full  opacity.
                                   Full  opacity is the level that you specify
                                   for the opacity setting. If you don't spec-
                                   ify a value for Fade-in, the image will ap-
                                   pear abruptly at the overlay start time.

                               FadeOut -> (integer)
                                   Specify the length of  time,  in  millisec-
                                   onds,  between the end of the time that you
                                   have specified for the image overlay  Dura-
                                   tion  and when the overlaid image has faded
                                   to total transparency. If you don't specify
                                   a value for Fade-out, the image will disap-
                                   pear abruptly at the end  of  the  inserted
                                   image duration.

                               Height -> (integer)
                                   Specify the height of the inserted image in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger  than  the  video resolution height,
                                   the service will crop your  overlaid  image
                                   to fit. To use the native height of the im-
                                   age, keep this setting blank.

                               ImageInserterInput -> (string)
                                   Specify the HTTP, HTTPS, or Amazon S3 loca-
                                   tion  of the image that you want to overlay
                                   on the video. Use a PNG or TGA file.

                               ImageX -> (integer)
                                   Specify the distance,  in  pixels,  between
                                   the inserted image and the left edge of the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               ImageY -> (integer)
                                   Specify  the  distance,  in pixels, between
                                   the overlaid image and the top edge of  the
                                   video frame. Required for any image overlay
                                   that you specify.

                               Layer -> (integer)
                                   Specify how overlapping inserted images ap-
                                   pear.  Images  with higher values for Layer
                                   appear on top of images with  lower  values
                                   for Layer.

                               Opacity -> (integer)
                                   Use  Opacity  (Opacity) to specify how much
                                   of the underlying video shows  through  the
                                   inserted image. 0 is transparent and 100 is
                                   fully opaque. Default is 50.

                               StartTime -> (string)
                                   Specify the timecode of the frame that  you
                                   want  the  overlay to first appear on. This
                                   must  be  in   timecode   (HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                                   HH:MM:SS;FF)  format. Remember to take into
                                   account your timecode source settings.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Specify the width of the inserted image  in
                                   pixels.  If  you  specify  a  value  that's
                                   larger than the video resolution width, the
                                   service  will  crop  your overlaid image to
                                   fit. To use the native width of the  image,
                                   keep this setting blank.

                        SdrReferenceWhiteLevel -> (integer)
                            Specify  the  reference  white level, in nits, for
                            all of your image inserter images. Use to  correct
                            brightness  levels within HDR10 outputs. For 1,000
                            nit peak brightness displays,  we  recommend  that
                            you  set SDR reference white level to 203 (accord-
                            ing to ITU-R BT.2408). Leave blank to use the  de-
                            fault value of 100, or specify an integer from 100
                            to 1000.

                     InputClippings -> (list)
                        (InputClippings) contains sets of start and end  times
                        that  together  specify  a  portion of the input to be
                        used in the outputs. If you provide only a start time,
                        the  clip  will be the entire input from that point to
                        the end. If you provide only an end time, it  will  be
                        the  entire  input  up to that point. When you specify
                        more than one input clip, the transcoding service cre-
                        ates  the  job outputs by stringing the clips together
                        in the order you specify them.

                        (structure)
                            To transcode only portions of your input,  include
                            one  input  clip  for each part of your input that
                            you want in your output. All input clips that  you
                            specify  will  be  included in every output of the
                            job.      For      more      information,      see
                            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/assembling-multiple-inputs-and-input-clips.html.

                            EndTimecode -> (string)
                               Set End timecode (EndTimecode) to  the  end  of
                               the  portion of the input you are clipping. The
                               frame corresponding to the End  timecode  value
                               is  included in the clip. Start timecode or End
                               timecode may be left blank, but not  both.  Use
                               the format HH:MM:SS:FF or HH:MM:SS;FF, where HH
                               is the hour, MM is the minute, SS is  the  sec-
                               ond,  and FF is the frame number. When choosing
                               this value, take into account your setting  for
                               timecode  source  under  input settings (Input-
                               TimecodeSource). For example, if you  have  em-
                               bedded  timecodes that start at 01:00:00:00 and
                               you want your clip to end six minutes into  the
                               video, use 01:06:00:00.

                            StartTimecode -> (string)
                               Set  Start  timecode (StartTimecode) to the be-
                               ginning of the portion of  the  input  you  are
                               clipping.  The frame corresponding to the Start
                               timecode value is included in the  clip.  Start
                               timecode or End timecode may be left blank, but
                               not  both.  Use  the  format   HH:MM:SS:FF   or
                               HH:MM:SS;FF,  where  HH  is the hour, MM is the
                               minute, SS is the second, and FF is  the  frame
                               number. When choosing this value, take into ac-
                               count your setting for Input  timecode  source.
                               For  example,  if  you  have embedded timecodes
                               that start at 01:00:00:00  and  you  want  your
                               clip  to begin five minutes into the video, use
                               01:05:00:00.

                     InputScanType -> (string)
                        When you have a progressive segmented frame (PsF)  in-
                        put, use this setting to flag the input as PsF. Media-
                        Convert doesn't automatically detect  PsF.  Therefore,
                        flagging your input as PsF results in better preserva-
                        tion of video quality when you  do  deinterlacing  and
                        frame  rate  conversion. If you don't specify, the de-
                        fault value is Auto (AUTO). Auto is the  correct  set-
                        ting  for  all inputs that are not PsF. Don't set this
                        value to PsF when your input is interlaced.  Doing  so
                        creates horizontal interlacing artifacts.

                     Position -> (structure)
                        Use Selection placement (position) to define the video
                        area in your output frame. The  area  outside  of  the
                        rectangle that you specify here is black. If you spec-
                        ify a value here, it will override any value that  you
                        specify in the output setting Selection placement (po-
                        sition). If you specify a value here, this will  over-
                        ride any AFD values in your input, even if you set Re-
                        spond to AFD (RespondToAfd) to Respond  (RESPOND).  If
                        you  specify  a  value here, this will ignore anything
                        that you specify  for  the  setting  Scaling  Behavior
                        (scalingBehavior).

                        Height -> (integer)
                            Height  of  rectangle in pixels. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                        Width -> (integer)
                            Width of rectangle in pixels.  Specify  only  even
                            numbers.

                        X -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the left edge of the  video  frame.  Specify  only
                            even numbers.

                        Y -> (integer)
                            The distance, in pixels, between the rectangle and
                            the top edge of the video frame. Specify only even
                            numbers.

                     ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                        Use  Program (programNumber) to select a specific pro-
                        gram from within  a  multi-program  transport  stream.
                        Note  that Quad 4K is not currently supported. Default
                        is the first program within the transport  stream.  If
                        the program you specify doesn't exist, the transcoding
                        service will use this default.

                     PsiControl -> (string)
                        Set PSI control (InputPsiControl) for transport stream
                        inputs  to  specify  which  data  the demux process to
                        scans. * Ignore PSI - Scan  all  PIDs  for  audio  and
                        video. * Use PSI - Scan only PSI data.

                     SupplementalImps -> (list)
                        Provide a list of any necessary supplemental IMPs. You
                        need supplemental IMPs if the CPL  that  you're  using
                        for your input is in an incomplete IMP. Specify either
                        the supplemental IMP directories with a trailing slash
                        or     the    ASSETMAP.xml    files.    For    example
                        ["s3://bucket/ov/",   "s3://bucket/vf2/ASSETMAP.xml"].
                        You  don't  need to specify the IMP that contains your
                        input CPL, because the service  automatically  detects
                        it.

                        (string)

                     TimecodeSource -> (string)
                        Use  this  Timecode  source setting, located under the
                        input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to  specify  how
                        the  service  counts  input  video  frames. This input
                        frame count affects only the behavior of features that
                        apply to a single input at a time, such as input clip-
                        ping and synchronizing some captions  formats.  Choose
                        Embedded (EMBEDDED) to use the timecodes in your input
                        video. Choose Start at zero (ZEROBASED) to  start  the
                        first  frame  at  zero. Choose Specified start (SPECI-
                        FIEDSTART) to start the first frame  at  the  timecode
                        that  you specify in the setting Start timecode (time-
                        codeStart). If you don't specify a value for  Timecode
                        source,  the service will use Embedded by default. For
                        more     information     about     timecodes,      see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/mediaconvert/timecode.

                     TimecodeStart -> (string)
                        Specify the timecode that you want the service to  use
                        for  this  input's initial frame. To use this setting,
                        you must set the Timecode source setting, located  un-
                        der the input settings (InputTimecodeSource), to Spec-
                        ified start  (SPECIFIEDSTART).  For  more  information
                        about                  timecodes,                  see

                     VideoGenerator -> (structure)
                        When you include Video generator, MediaConvert creates
                        a video input with black frames. Use this  setting  if
                        you  do  not  have a video input or if you want to add
                        black video frames before, or after, other inputs. You
                        can specify Video generator, or you can specify an In-
                        put file, but you cannot specify both. For more infor-
                        mation,                                            see
                        https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/video-generator.html

                        Duration -> (integer)
                            Specify  an integer value for Black video duration
                            from 50 to 86400000 to generate a black video  in-
                            put  for that many milliseconds. Required when you
                            include Video generator.

                     VideoSelector -> (structure)
                        Input video selectors contain the video  settings  for
                        the  input.  Each  of  your  inputs can have up to one
                        video selector.

                        AlphaBehavior -> (string)
                            Ignore this setting unless this input is a  Quick-
                            Time  animation  with  an  alpha channel. Use this
                            setting to create separate Key and  Fill  outputs.
                            In  each  output,  specify which part of the input
                            MediaConvert uses. Leave this setting at  the  de-
                            fault  value  DISCARD  to delete the alpha channel
                            and preserve the video. Set it to REMAP_TO_LUMA to
                            delete  the video and map the alpha channel to the
                            luma channel of your outputs.

                        ColorSpace -> (string)
                            If your input video has accurate color space meta-
                            data,  or  if  you  don't  know about color space,
                            leave this set to the default  value  Follow.  The
                            service will automatically detect your input color
                            space. If your input video has metadata indicating
                            the  wrong color space, specify the accurate color
                            space here. If your input video is HDR 10 and  the
                            SMPTE  ST  2086  Mastering  Display  Color  Volume
                            static  metadata  isn't  present  in  your   video
                            stream, or if that metadata is present but not ac-
                            curate, choose Force HDR 10 here and specify  cor-
                            rect values in the input HDR 10 metadata settings.

                        ColorSpaceUsage -> (string)
                            There are two sources for color metadata, the  in-
                            put  file  and  the job input settings Color space
                            (ColorSpace) and HDR  master  display  information
                            settings(Hdr10Metadata).  The  Color  space  usage
                            setting determines which takes precedence.  Choose
                            Force (FORCE) to use color metadata from the input
                            job settings. If  you  don't  specify  values  for
                            those  settings,  the  service  defaults  to using
                            metadata from your input. FALLBACK - Choose  Fall-
                            back  (FALLBACK)  to  use  color metadata from the
                            source when it is present.  If  there's  no  color
                            metadata  in your input file, the service defaults
                            to using values you specify in the input settings.

                        EmbeddedTimecodeOverride -> (string)
                            Set  Embedded  timecode  override   (embeddedTime-
                            codeOverride)  to  Use  MDPM  (USE_MDPM) when your
                            AVCHD input contains timecode tag data in the Mod-
                            ified Digital Video Pack Metadata (MDPM). When you
                            do, we recommend you also set Timecode source (in-
                            putTimecodeSource)  to  Embedded (EMBEDDED). Leave
                            Embedded timecode override blank, or set  to  None
                            (NONE),  when  your  input  does  not contain MDPM
                            timecode.

                        Hdr10Metadata -> (structure)
                            Use these settings to provide HDR 10 metadata that
                            is  missing or inaccurate in your input video. Ap-
                            propriate values vary depending on the input video
                            and  must be provided by a color grader. The color
                            grader generates these values during  the  HDR  10
                            mastering  process.  The  valid  range for each of
                            these settings is 0 to 50,000. Each increment rep-
                            resents  0.00002  in CIE1931 color coordinate. Re-

                            you  must also set Color space (ColorSpace) to HDR
                            10 (HDR10). To specify whether the the values  you
                            specify  here  take  precedence over the values in
                            the metadata of your input file, set  Color  space
                            usage  (ColorSpaceUsage). To specify whether color
                            metadata is included in an output, set Color meta-
                            data  (ColorMetadata).  For more information about

                            and not generate black video,  set  Pad  video  to
                            Disabled (DISABLED) or leave blank.

                        Pid -> (integer)
                            Use  PID  (Pid) to select specific video data from
                            an input file. Specify this value as  an  integer;
                            the  system  automatically converts it to the hex-
                            idecimal  value.  For  example,  257  selects  PID
                            0x101.  A PID, or packet identifier, is an identi-
                            fier for a set of  data  in  an  MPEG-2  transport
                            stream container.

                        ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                            Selects   a   specific   program   from  within  a
                            multi-program transport stream. Note that Quad  4K
                            is not currently supported.

                        Rotate -> (string)
                            Use  Rotate  (InputRotate) to specify how the ser-
                            vice rotates your video. You can choose  automatic
                            rotation  or specify a rotation. You can specify a
                            clockwise rotation of 0, 90, 180, or 270  degrees.
                            If  your input video container is .mov or .mp4 and
                            your input has rotation metadata, you  can  choose
                            Automatic  to  have  the service rotate your video
                            according to the rotation specified in  the  meta-
                            data.  The  rotation  must be within one degree of
                            90, 180, or 270 degrees. If the rotation  metadata
                            specifies any other rotation, the service will de-
                            fault to no rotation. By default, the service does
                            no rotation, even if your input video has rotation
                            metadata. The service doesn't pass  through  rota-
                            tion metadata.

                        SampleRange -> (string)
                            If  the  sample range metadata in your input video
                            is accurate, or if you  don't  know  about  sample
                            range,  keep  the  default value, Follow (FOLLOW),
                            for this setting. When you do, the  service  auto-
                            matically detects your input sample range. If your
                            input video has metadata indicating the wrong sam-
                            ple range, specify the accurate sample range here.
                            When you do, MediaConvert ignores any sample range
                            information  in  the input metadata. Regardless of
                            whether MediaConvert uses the input  sample  range
                            or the sample range that you specify, MediaConvert
                            uses the sample range  for  transcoding  and  also
                            writes it to the output metadata.

              KantarWatermark -> (structure)
                 Use  these  settings  only  when you use Kantar watermarking.
                 Specify the values that MediaConvert  uses  to  generate  and
                 place  Kantar watermarks in your output audio. These settings
                 apply to every output in your job. In addition to  specifying
                 these  values, you also need to store your Kantar credentials
                 in  AWS  Secrets   Manager.   For   more   information,   see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/kantar-watermarking.html.

                 ChannelName -> (string)
                     Provide an audio channel name from your Kantar audio  li-
                     cense.

                 ContentReference -> (string)
                     Specify  a  unique  identifier for Kantar to use for this
                     piece of content.

                 CredentialsSecretName -> (string)
                     Provide the name of the AWS Secrets Manager secret  where
                     your Kantar credentials are stored. Note that your Media-
                     Convert service role must provide access to this  secret.
                     For            more            information,           see

                 FileOffset -> (double)
                     Optional.  Specify  an offset, in whole seconds, from the
                     start of your output and the beginning of the  watermark-
                     ing. When you don't specify an offset, Kantar defaults to
                     zero.

                 KantarLicenseId -> (integer)
                     Provide your Kantar license ID  number.  You  should  get
                     this number from Kantar.

                 KantarServerUrl -> (string)
                     Provide  the  HTTPS  endpoint  to  the Kantar server. You
                     should get this endpoint from Kantar.

                 LogDestination -> (string)
                     Optional. Specify the Amazon S3 bucket where you want Me-
                     diaConvert  to store your Kantar watermark XML logs. When
                     you don't specify a  bucket,  MediaConvert  doesn't  save
                     these logs. Note that your MediaConvert service role must
                     provide access to this location.  For  more  information,
                     see
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/iam-role.html

                 Metadata3 -> (string)
                     You  can  optionally  use this field to specify the first
                     timestamp that Kantar embeds during watermarking.  Kantar
                     suggests that you be very cautious when using this Kantar
                     feature, and that you use it only on  channels  that  are
                     managed  specifically  for  use with this feature by your
                     Audience Measurement Operator. For more information about
                     this feature, contact Kantar technical support.

                 Metadata4 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata5 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata6 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata7 -> (string)
                     Additional metadata that MediaConvert  sends  to  Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

                 Metadata8 -> (string)
                     Additional  metadata  that  MediaConvert sends to Kantar.
                     Maximum length is 50 characters.

              MotionImageInserter -> (structure)
                 Overlay motion graphics on top  of  your  video.  The  motion
                 graphics  that  you specify here appear on all outputs in all
                 output     groups.     For     more     information,      see
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/motion-graphic-overlay.html.

                 Framerate -> (structure)
                     If your motion graphic asset is a .mov  file,  keep  this
                     setting  unspecified.  If  your motion graphic asset is a
                     series of .png files, specify the frame rate of the over-
                     lay  in  frames  per  second, as a fraction. For example,
                     specify 24 fps as 24/1. Make sure that the number of  im-
                     ages  in  your series matches the frame rate and your in-
                     tended overlay duration.  For  example,  if  you  want  a
                     30-second overlay at 30 fps, you should have 900 .png im-
                     ages. This overlay frame rate doesn't need to  match  the
                     frame rate of the underlying video.

                     FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                        The bottom of the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 1.

                     FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                        The  top  of  the fraction that expresses your overlay
                        frame rate. For example, if your frame rate is 24 fps,
                        set this value to 24.

                 Input -> (string)
                     Specify  the  .mov  file or series of .png files that you
                     want to overlay on your video. For  .png  files,  provide
                     the  file name of the first file in the series. Make sure
                     that the names of the .png files end with sequential num-
                     bers  that specify the order that they are played in. For
                     example,    overlay_000.png,    overlay_001.png,    over-
                     lay_002.png,  and so on. The sequence must start at zero,
                     and each image file name must have  the  same  number  of
                     digits.  Pad your initial file names with enough zeros to
                     complete the sequence. For example, if the first image is
                     overlay_0.png,  there  can  be  only 10 images in the se-
                     quence, with the last image being overlay_9.png.  But  if
                     the  first  image is overlay_00.png, there can be 100 im-
                     ages in the sequence.

                 InsertionMode -> (string)
                     Choose the type of motion graphic asset that you are pro-
                     viding  for  your  overlay.  You can choose either a .mov
                     file or a series of .png files.

                 Offset -> (structure)
                     Use Offset  to  specify  the  placement  of  your  motion
                     graphic  overlay  on  the video frame. Specify in pixels,
                     from the upper-left corner of the  frame.  If  you  don't
                     specify an offset, the service scales your overlay to the
                     full size of the frame. Otherwise,  the  service  inserts
                     the  overlay at its native resolution and scales the size
                     up or down with any video scaling.

                     ImageX -> (integer)
                        Set the distance, in pixels, between the  overlay  and
                        the left edge of the video frame.

                     ImageY -> (integer)
                        Set  the  distance, in pixels, between the overlay and
                        the top edge of the video frame.

                 Playback -> (string)
                     Specify whether your motion graphic overlay repeats on  a
                     loop or plays only once.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     Specify when the motion overlay begins. Use timecode for-
                     mat (HH:MM:SS:FF or  HH:MM:SS;FF).  Make  sure  that  the
                     timecode you provide here takes into account how you have
                     set up your timecode configuration under  both  job  set-
                     tings  and input settings. The simplest way to do that is
                     to set both to start at 0. If you need to set up your job
                     to  follow  timecodes  embedded in your source that don't
                     start at zero, make sure that you specify  a  start  time
                     that  is  after the first embedded timecode. For more in-
                     formation,   see    https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediacon-

              NielsenConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Settings for your Nielsen  configuration.  If  you  don't  do
                 Nielsen  measurement  and  analytics,  ignore these settings.
                 When you enable Nielsen configuration (nielsenConfiguration),
                 MediaConvert  enables  PCM  to ID3 tagging for all outputs in
                 the job. To enable  Nielsen  configuration  programmatically,
                 include  an instance of nielsenConfiguration in your JSON job
                 specification. Even if you  don't  include  any  children  of
                 nielsenConfiguration, you still enable the setting.

                 BreakoutCode -> (integer)
                     Nielsen  has  discontinued the use of breakout code func-
                     tionality. If you must include  this  property,  set  the
                     value to zero.

                 DistributorId -> (string)
                     Use  Distributor  ID  (DistributorID) to specify the dis-
                     tributor ID that is  assigned  to  your  organization  by
                     Neilsen.

              NielsenNonLinearWatermark -> (structure)
                 Ignore these settings unless you are using Nielsen non-linear
                 watermarking. Specify the values that  MediaConvert  uses  to
                 generate  and  place Nielsen watermarks in your output audio.
                 In addition to specifying these values, you also need to  set
                 up  your cloud TIC server. These settings apply to every out-
                 put in your job. The MediaConvert implementation is currently
                 with  the  following  Nielsen versions: Nielsen Watermark SDK
                 Version 5.2.1 Nielsen  NLM  Watermark  Engine  Version  1.2.7
                 Nielsen Watermark Authenticator [SID_TIC] Version [5.0.0]

                 ActiveWatermarkProcess -> (string)
                     Choose  the  type  of Nielsen watermarks that you want in
                     your  outputs.  When   you   choose   NAES   2   and   NW
                     (NAES2_AND_NW),  you must provide a value for the setting
                     SID (sourceId). When you choose  CBET  (CBET),  you  must
                     provide a value for the setting CSID (cbetSourceId). When
                     you choose NAES 2, NW, and CBET  (NAES2_AND_NW_AND_CBET),
                     you must provide values for both of these settings.

                 AdiFilename -> (string)
                     Optional.  Use  this setting when you want the service to
                     include an ADI file in the Nielsen metadata .zip file. To
                     provide  an ADI file, store it in Amazon S3 and provide a
                     URL to it here. The URL should be in the  following  for-
                     mat:   S3://bucket/path/ADI-file.  For  more  information
                     about the metadata .zip file, see  the  setting  Metadata
                     destination (metadataDestination).

                 AssetId -> (string)
                     Use  the asset ID that you provide to Nielsen to uniquely
                     identify this asset. Required for all Nielsen  non-linear
                     watermarking.

                 AssetName -> (string)
                     Use  the  asset name that you provide to Nielsen for this
                     asset. Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 CbetSourceId -> (string)
                     Use the CSID that Nielsen  provides  to  you.  This  CBET
                     source  ID  should  be unique to your Nielsen account but
                     common to all of your output assets that have CBET water-
                     marking. Required when you choose a value for the setting
                     Watermark types  (ActiveWatermarkProcess)  that  includes
                     CBET.

                 EpisodeId -> (string)
                     Optional.  If this asset uses an episode ID with Nielsen,
                     provide it here.

                 MetadataDestination -> (string)
                     Specify the Amazon S3 location where you  want  MediaCon-
                     vert  to save your Nielsen non-linear metadata .zip file.
                     This Amazon S3 bucket must be in the same Region  as  the
                     one  where  you  do your MediaConvert transcoding. If you
                     want to include an ADI file in this .zip  file,  use  the
                     setting  ADI  file (adiFilename) to specify it. MediaCon-
                     vert delivers the Nielsen metadata  .zip  files  only  to
                     your  metadata  destination  Amazon S3 bucket. It doesn't
                     deliver the .zip files to Nielsen.  You  are  responsible
                     for delivering the metadata .zip files to Nielsen.

                 SourceId -> (integer)
                     Use  the SID that Nielsen provides to you. This source ID
                     should be unique to your Nielsen account  but  common  to
                     all  of  your  output  assets.  Required  for all Nielsen
                     non-linear watermarking. This ID should be unique to your
                     Nielsen  account but common to all of your output assets.
                     Required for all Nielsen non-linear watermarking.

                 SourceWatermarkStatus -> (string)
                     Required. Specify whether  your  source  content  already
                     contains Nielsen non-linear watermarks. When you set this
                     value to Watermarked (WATERMARKED), the service fails the
                     job.  Nielsen requires that you add non-linear watermark-
                     ing to only  clean  content  that  doesn't  already  have
                     non-linear Nielsen watermarks.

                 TicServerUrl -> (string)
                     Specify the endpoint for the TIC server that you have de-
                     ployed and configured in the AWS Cloud. Required for  all
                     Nielsen  non-linear watermarking. MediaConvert can't con-
                     nect directly to a TIC server. Instead, you must use  API
                     Gateway  to provide a RESTful interface between MediaCon-
                     vert and a TIC server that you deploy  in  your  AWS  ac-
                     count.  For more information on deploying a TIC server in
                     your AWS account and the required  API  Gateway,  contact
                     Nielsen support.

                 UniqueTicPerAudioTrack -> (string)
                     To  create  assets  that have the same TIC values in each
                     audio  track,  keep  the   default   value   Share   TICs
                     (SAME_TICS_PER_TRACK).  To create assets that have unique
                     TIC values for each audio track, choose Use  unique  TICs
                     (RESERVE_UNIQUE_TICS_PER_TRACK).

              OutputGroups -> (list)
                 (OutputGroups) contains one group of settings for each set of
                 outputs that share a  common  package  type.  All  unpackaged
                 files  (MPEG-4,  MPEG-2 TS, Quicktime, MXF, and no container)
                 are grouped in a single output group  as  well.  Required  in
                 (OutputGroups) is a group of settings that apply to the whole
                 group. This required object depends on the value you set  for
                 (Type) under (OutputGroups)>(OutputGroupSettings). Type, set-
                 tings object pairs are as follows. * FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS, Fi-
                 leGroupSettings   *  HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS,  HlsGroupSettings  *
                 DASH_ISO_GROUP_SETTINGS,        DashIsoGroupSettings        *
                 MS_SMOOTH_GROUP_SETTINGS,       MsSmoothGroupSettings       *

                 (structure)
                     Group of outputs

                     AutomatedEncodingSettings -> (structure)
                        Use automated encoding  to  have  MediaConvert  choose
                        your  encoding settings for you, based on characteris-
                        tics of your input video.

                        AbrSettings -> (structure)
                            Use automated ABR to have MediaConvert set up  the
                            renditions  in  your ABR package for you automati-
                            cally, based  on  characteristics  of  your  input
                            video.  This feature optimizes video quality while
                            minimizing the overall size of your ABR package.

                            MaxAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum target bit rate  used  in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               an upper limit on the bandwidth consumed by the
                               highest-quality  rendition.  This is the rendi-
                               tion that is  delivered  to  viewers  with  the
                               fastest  internet  connections.  If  you  don't
                               specify a value, MediaConvert uses 8,000,000 (8
                               mb/s) by default.

                            MaxRenditions -> (integer)
                               Optional. The maximum number of renditions that
                               MediaConvert will create in your automated  ABR
                               stack.  The  number of renditions is determined
                               automatically, based on analysis of  each  job,
                               but  will never exceed this limit. When you set
                               this to Auto in the console, which  is  equiva-
                               lent  to excluding it from your JSON job speci-
                               fication, MediaConvert defaults to a  limit  of
                               15.

                            MinAbrBitrate -> (integer)
                               Optional.  The  minimum  target bitrate used in
                               your automated ABR stack. Use this value to set
                               a lower limit on the bitrate of video delivered
                               to viewers with slow internet  connections.  If
                               you  don't  specify  a value, MediaConvert uses
                               600,000 (600 kb/s) by default.

                            Rules -> (list)
                               Optional. Use Automated ABR  rules  to  specify
                               restrictions  for the rendition sizes MediaCon-
                               vert will create in your ABR stack. You can use
                               these  rules  if your ABR workflow has specific
                               rendition size requirements, but you still want
                               MediaConvert  to optimize for video quality and
                               overall file size.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify one  or  more  Automated  ABR  rule
                                   types. Note: Force include and Allowed ren-

                                      in  your ABR stack. * The lowest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter. For example: If you specify 640x360
                                      the  lowest resolution in your ABR stack
                                      will be equal  to  or  greater  than  to
                                      640x360. * If you specify a Min top ren-
                                      dition size rule,  the  value  that  you
                                      specify  for  Min  bottom rendition size
                                      must be less than, or equal to, Min  top
                                      rendition size.

                                      Height -> (integer)
                                          Use Height to define the video reso-
                                          lution height, in pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                      Width -> (integer)
                                          Use  Width to define the video reso-
                                          lution width, in  pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                   MinTopRenditionSize -> (structure)
                                      Use  Min top rendition size to specify a
                                      minimum size for the highest  resolution
                                      in your ABR stack. * The highest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter.  For  example:   If   you   specify
                                      1280x720  the highest resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  1280x720. * If you specify a value
                                      for Max resolution, the value  that  you
                                      specify  for Min top rendition size must
                                      be less than, or equal to,  Max  resolu-
                                      tion.

                                      Height -> (integer)
                                          Use Height to define the video reso-
                                          lution height, in pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                      Width -> (integer)
                                          Use  Width to define the video reso-
                                          lution width, in  pixels,  for  this
                                          rule.

                                   Type -> (string)
                                      Use  Min top rendition size to specify a
                                      minimum size for the highest  resolution
                                      in your ABR stack. * The highest resolu-
                                      tion in your ABR stack will be equal  to
                                      or  greater  than the value that you en-
                                      ter.  For  example:   If   you   specify
                                      1280x720  the highest resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  1280x720. * If you specify a value
                                      for Max resolution, the value  that  you
                                      specify  for Min top rendition size must
                                      be less than, or equal to,  Max  resolu-
                                      tion.  Use  Min bottom rendition size to
                                      specify a minimum size  for  the  lowest
                                      resolution in your ABR stack. * The low-
                                      est resolution in your ABR stack will be
                                      equal  to or greater than the value that
                                      you enter. For example: If  you  specify
                                      640x360  the  lowest  resolution in your
                                      ABR stack will be equal  to  or  greater
                                      than  to 640x360. * If you specify a Min
                                      top rendition size rule, the value  that
                                      you  specify  for  Min  bottom rendition
                                      size must be less than, or equal to, Min
                                      top  rendition  size.  Use Force include
                                      renditions to specify one or more  reso-
                                      lutions  to  include  your  ABR stack. *
                                      (Recommended) To optimize automated ABR,
                                      specify  as few resolutions as possible.
                                      * (Required) The number  of  resolutions
                                      that  you  specify  must be equal to, or
                                      less than, the Max renditions setting. *
                                      If  you specify a Min top rendition size
                                      rule, specify at  least  one  resolution
                                      that  is  equal to, or greater than, Min
                                      top rendition size. * If you  specify  a
                                      Min  bottom  rendition  size  rule, only
                                      specify resolutions that are  equal  to,
                                      or  greater  than,  Min bottom rendition
                                      size. * If you specify a  Force  include
                                      renditions  rule, do not specify a sepa-
                                      rate  rule  for  Allowed  renditions.  *
                                      Note:  The  ABR  stack may include other
                                      resolutions  that  you  do  not  specify
                                      here,  depending  on  the Max renditions
                                      setting. Use Allowed renditions to spec-
                                      ify  a  list  of possible resolutions in
                                      your ABR stack. * (Required) The  number
                                      of  resolutions that you specify must be
                                      equal to, or greater than, the Max  ren-
                                      ditions  setting.  *  MediaConvert  will
                                      create an ABR stack exclusively from the
                                      list  of resolutions that you specify. *
                                      Some resolutions in the  Allowed  rendi-
                                      tions  list may not be included, however
                                      you can force a  resolution  to  be  in-
                                      cluded by setting Required to ENABLED. *
                                      You must specify at least one resolution
                                      that  is  greater  than  or equal to any
                                      resolutions that you specify in Min  top
                                      rendition  size  or Min bottom rendition
                                      size. * If you  specify  Allowed  rendi-
                                      tions,  you  must not specify a separate

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the service creates one top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest and one top -level .mpd DASH
                               manifest  for  each  CMAF  output group in your
                               job. These default  manifests  reference  every
                               output  in  the  output  group. To create addi-
                               tional top-level  manifests  that  reference  a
                               subset  of  the  outputs  in  the output group,
                               specify a list of them  here.  For  each  addi-
                               tional  manifest  that you specify, the service
                               creates one HLS manifest and one DASH manifest.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each  pair  of  HLS
                                   and DASH additional manifests that you want
                                   the service to generate for this CMAF  out-
                                   put  group. Each pair of manifests can ref-
                                   erence a different subset of outputs in the
                                   group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest  for  your  HLS  group  is
                                      film-name.m3u8.  If  you enter "-no-pre-
                                      mium" for this setting,  then  the  file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8.  For HLS output groups, spec-
                                      ify a manifestNameModifier that is  dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put. The service uses  the  output  name
                                      modifier  to create unique names for the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                               requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag.  Other-
                               wise,  keep the default value Enabled (ENABLED)
                               and control caching in your video  distribution
                               set up. For example, use the Cache-Control http
                               header.

                            CodecSpecification -> (string)
                               Specification to use (RFC-6381 or  the  default
                               RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  how  your job outputs are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                          of  the  key for the setting KMS ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented  by  a  32-character text string. If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Specify the encryption scheme that you want
                                   the  service  to  use  when encrypting your
                                   CMAF  segments.  Choose  AES-CBC  subsample
                                   (SAMPLE-AES) or AES_CTR (AES-CTR).

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   When  you use DRM with CMAF outputs, choose
                                   whether the service writes the 128-bit  en-
                                   cryption  initialization  vector in the HLS
                                   and DASH manifests.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output  group  type  is  CMAF,  use
                                   these  settings  when  doing DRM encryption
                                   with a  SPEKE-compliant  key  provider.  If
                                   your output group type is HLS, DASH, or Mi-
                                   crosoft Smooth,  use  the  SpekeKeyProvider
                                   settings instead.

                               Specify the length, in whole  seconds,  of  the
                               mp4  fragments. When you don't specify a value,
                               MediaConvert defaults to  2.  Related  setting:

                            ImageBasedTrickPlay -> (string)
                               Specify  whether  MediaConvert generates images
                               for trick play. Keep the  default  value,  None
                               (NONE),  to  not  generate  any  images. Choose
                               Thumbnail (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumb-
                               nails.  Choose Thumbnail and full frame (THUMB-
                               NAIL_AND_FULLFRAME) to  generate  tiled  thumb-
                               nails  and  full-resolution  images  of  single
                               frames. When  you  enable  Write  HLS  manifest
                               (WriteHlsManifest),   MediaConvert   creates  a
                               child manifest for each set of images that  you
                               generate  and adds corresponding entries to the
                               parent manifest. When  you  enable  Write  DASH
                               manifest (WriteDashManifest), MediaConvert adds
                               an entry in the .mpd manifest for each  set  of
                               images  that you generate. A common application
                               for these images is Roku trick mode. The thumb-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating  thumbnails. If set to FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert generates thumbnails for  each
                                   IDR  frame  in the output (matching the GOP
                                   cadence). If set to  FOLLOW_CUSTOM,  Media-
                                   Convert  generates  thumbnails according to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job will be rejected. Must be divisible  by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)
                               When set to GZIP, compresses HLS playlist.

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the  output  manifest  should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set.  If you know that player devices are hang-
                               ing on the final segment of your video  because
                               the  length of your final segment is too short,
                               use this setting to  specify  a  minimum  final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is greater than or equal to  1  and  less  than
                               your  segment  length. When you specify a value
                               for this setting, the encoder will combine  any
                               final  segment  that is shorter than the length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example,  your  segment length is 3 seconds and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum  final  segment  length;  when you set the
                               minimum final segment length to 1,  your  final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand
                               or  main.  When   you   choose   Main   profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),   the   service    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you  must
                               also  set the output group setting Segment con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting  only when your output video
                               stream has B-frames, which causes  the  initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the initial decode time  stamp  (DTS).  Specify
                               how  MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time
                               stamps in output DASH manifests.  Choose  Match
                               initial  PTS  (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want
                               MediaConvert to use  the  initial  PTS  as  the
                               first   time  stamp  in  the  manifest.  Choose
                               Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have  MediaConvert
                               ignore  the initial PTS in the video stream and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames, the time stamps in  your  DASH  mani-
                               fests  start  at zero regardless of your choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single  output  file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing the Fragment  Length  and  Segment  Length.
                               When  set  to SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to specify whether the  encoder  enforces  this
                               value  strictly.  Use Segment control (CmafSeg-
                               mentControl) to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment
                               boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            StreamInfResolution -> (string)
                               Include or  exclude  RESOLUTION  attribute  for
                               video  in EXT-X-STREAM-INF tag of variant mani-

                            TargetDurationCompatibilityMode -> (string)
                               When set to LEGACY, the segment target duration
                               is  always  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value above its current value in seconds.  When
                               set  to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target du-
                               ration is rounded up  to  the  nearest  integer
                               value  if  fraction seconds are greater than or
                               equal to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if  less
                               than  0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration  is  always longer than the actual dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-
                               perience  interrupted  playback when the actual
                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            WriteDashManifest -> (string)
                               When  set  to ENABLED, a DASH MPD manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteHlsManifest -> (string)
                               When set to ENABLED, an Apple HLS manifest will
                               be generated for this output.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)

                               tation),  your DASH manifest shows precise seg-
                               ment durations. The segment  duration  informa-
                               tion  appears  inside  the SegmentTimeline ele-
                               ment, inside SegmentTemplate at the Representa-

                               the segment durations in your DASH manifest are
                               approximate.  The  segment duration information
                               appears in the duration attribute of  the  Seg-
                               mentTemplate element.

                        DashIsoGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related to your DASH output package. For

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By  default,  the service creates one .mpd DASH
                               manifest for each DASH ISO output group in your
                               job.  This  default  manifest  references every
                               output in the output  group.  To  create  addi-
                               tional  DASH  manifests that reference a subset
                               of the outputs in the output group,  specify  a
                               list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify  the  details  for  each additional
                                   DASH manifest that you want the service  to
                                   generate  for this output group. Each mani-
                                   fest can reference a  different  subset  of
                                   outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for  your  DASH  group  is
                                      film-name.mpd.  If  you  enter "-no-pre-
                                      mium" for this setting,  then  the  file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.mpd.

                            AudioChannelConfigSchemeIdUri -> (string)
                               Use  this setting only when your audio codec is
                               a Dolby one (AC3,  EAC3,  or  Atmos)  and  your
                               downstream  workflow  requires  that  your DASH
                               manifest use the  Dolby  channel  configuration
                               tag, rather than the MPEG one. For example, you
                               might need to use this to make dynamic  ad  in-
                               sertion  work. Specify which audio channel con-
                               figuration scheme ID URI MediaConvert writes in
                               your  DASH  manifest.  Keep  the default value,
                               MPEG channel  configuration  (MPEG_CHANNEL_CON-
                               FIGURATION),  to  have MediaConvert write this:
                               urn:mpeg:mpegB:cicp:ChannelConfiguration.
                               Choose Dolby channel configuration (DOLBY_CHAN-
                               NEL_CONFIGURATION) to have  MediaConvert  write
                               this                                   instead:
                               tag:dolby.com,2014:dash:audio_channel_configuration:2011.

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A  partial  URI  prefix that will be put in the
                               manifest (.mpd) file at the top  level  BaseURL
                               element.  Can  be used if streams are delivered
                               from a different URL than the manifest file.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses data keys to en-
                                          crypt your  content.  AWS  also  en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then  stores the encrypted data keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use  this  setting  to specify which
                                          AWS service  manages  the  CMK.  For
                                          simplest  set  up,  choose Amazon S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If  you
                                          want  your  master key to be managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose  AWS KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).  By  default,  when   you
                                          choose  AWS  KMS,  KMS  uses the AWS
                                          managed customer  master  key  (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your data keys. You  can  optionally
                                          choose  to specify a different, cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the key for the setting  KMS  ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated  data  (AAD)  to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-

                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                                   will exclude the access unit delimiter  and
                                   will leave the SEI NAL units unencrypted.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If  your output group type is HLS, DASH, or
                                   Microsoft Smooth, use these  settings  when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key provider. If your output group type  is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt

                                   Url -> (string)
                                      Specify the URL to the key  server  that
                                      your  SPEKE-compliant  DRM  key provider
                                      uses to provide keys for encrypting your

                            FragmentLength -> (integer)
                               Length  of  fragments to generate (in seconds).
                               Fragment length must  be  compatible  with  GOP
                               size  and  Framerate.  Note that fragments will
                               end on the next keyframe after this  number  of
                               seconds,  so  actual  fragment  length  may  be
                               longer. When Emit Single File is  checked,  the
                               fragmentation  is  internal  to a single output
                               file and it does not cause the creation of many
                               output files as in other output types.

                               for trick play. Keep the  default  value,  None
                               (NONE),  to  not  generate  any  images. Choose
                               Thumbnail (THUMBNAIL) to generate tiled  thumb-

                               IntervalCadence -> (string)
                                   The cadence MediaConvert follows for gener-
                                   ating thumbnails. If set to  FOLLOW_IFRAME,
                                   MediaConvert  generates thumbnails for each
                                   IDR frame in the output (matching  the  GOP
                                   cadence).  If  set to FOLLOW_CUSTOM, Media-
                                   Convert generates thumbnails  according  to
                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height of each thumbnail within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Leave blank to maintain
                                   aspect ratio with thumbnail width. If  fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job  will be rejected. Must be divisible by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval you enter doesn't align  with  the
                                   output  frame  rate, MediaConvert automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put frame rate is 29.97 frames  per  second
                                   and  you  enter  5, MediaConvert uses a 150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width of each thumbnail  within  each  tile
                                   image,  in  pixels. Default is 312. Must be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each  column  of  a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number of thumbnails in each row of a  tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            MinBufferTime -> (integer)
                               Minimum  time  of initially buffered media that
                               is needed to ensure smooth playout.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep this setting at the default  value  of  0,
                               unless  you  are troubleshooting a problem with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set.  If you know that player devices are hang-
                               ing on the final segment of your video  because
                               the  length of your final segment is too short,
                               use this setting to  specify  a  minimum  final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is greater than or equal to  1  and  less  than
                               your  segment  length. When you specify a value
                               for this setting, the encoder will combine  any
                               final  segment  that is shorter than the length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example,  your  segment length is 3 seconds and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum  final  segment  length;  when you set the
                               minimum final segment length to 1,  your  final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MpdProfile -> (string)
                               Specify  whether your DASH profile is on-demand
                               or  main.  When   you   choose   Main   profile
                               (MAIN_PROFILE),     the     service     signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-main:2011  in  your
                               .mpd  DASH  manifest. When you choose On-demand
                               (ON_DEMAND_PROFILE),   the   service    signals
                               urn:mpeg:dash:profile:isoff-on-demand:2011   in
                               your .mpd. When you choose On-demand, you  must
                               also  set the output group setting Segment con-
                               trol  (SegmentControl)  to  Single  file  (SIN-
                               GLE_FILE).

                            PtsOffsetHandlingForBFrames -> (string)
                               Use  this  setting  only when your output video
                               stream has B-frames, which causes  the  initial
                               presentation time stamp (PTS) to be offset from
                               the initial decode time  stamp  (DTS).  Specify
                               how  MediaConvert handles PTS when writing time
                               stamps in output DASH manifests.  Choose  Match
                               initial  PTS  (MATCH_INITIAL_PTS) when you want
                               MediaConvert to use  the  initial  PTS  as  the
                               first   time  stamp  in  the  manifest.  Choose
                               Zero-based (ZERO_BASED)  to  have  MediaConvert
                               ignore  the initial PTS in the video stream and
                               instead write the initial time stamp as zero in
                               the  manifest.  For  outputs  that  don't  have
                               B-frames, the time stamps in  your  DASH  mani-
                               fests  start  at zero regardless of your choice
                               here.

                            SegmentControl -> (string)
                               When set to SINGLE_FILE, a single  output  file
                               is generated, which is internally segmented us-
                               ing the Fragment  Length  and  Segment  Length.
                               When  set  to SEGMENTED_FILES, separate segment
                               files will be created.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 30. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)
                               to specify whether the  encoder  enforces  this
                               value    strictly.    Use    Segment    control
                               (DashIsoSegmentControl) to specify whether  Me-
                               diaConvert  creates  separate  segment files or
                               one content file that has metadata to mark  the
                               segment boundaries.

                            SegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            WriteSegmentTimelineInRepresentation -> (string)

                               setting and run  your  transcoding  job  again.
                               When  you  enable  this  setting,  the  service
                               writes precise segment durations  in  the  DASH
                               manifest.  The segment duration information ap-
                               pears inside the SegmentTimeline  element,  in-
                               side   SegmentTemplate  at  the  Representation
                               level. When you don't enable this setting,  the
                               service writes approximate segment durations in
                               your DASH manifest.

                        FileGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings related to your File output group. Media-
                            Convert  uses this group of settings to generate a
                            single standalone file, rather  than  a  streaming
                            package.  When  you work directly in your JSON job
                            specification, include this  object  and  any  re-
                            quired  children  when you set Type, under Output-
                            GroupSettings, to FILE_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output  location  and the output filename base.
                               Destination accepts format identifiers. If  you
                               do  not  specify  the base filename in the URI,
                               the service will use the filename of the  input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings associated with the destination.  Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                               S3Settings -> (structure)
                                   Settings associated with S3 destination

                                   AccessControl -> (structure)
                                      Optional.  Have  MediaConvert  automati-
                                      cally apply Amazon S3 access control for
                                      the  outputs  in this output group. When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose an Amazon S3 canned  ACL  for
                                          MediaConvert  to  apply to this out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings for how your  job  outputs  are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify how you want your data  keys
                                          managed.  AWS  uses data keys to en-
                                          crypt your  content.  AWS  also  en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then  stores the encrypted data keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use  this  setting  to specify which
                                          AWS service  manages  the  CMK.  For
                                          simplest  set  up,  choose Amazon S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3). If  you
                                          want  your  master key to be managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose  AWS KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).  By  default,  when   you
                                          choose  AWS  KMS,  KMS  uses the AWS
                                          managed customer  master  key  (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your data keys. You  can  optionally
                                          choose  to specify a different, cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the key for the setting  KMS  ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the encryption
                                          context that you want to use  along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated  data  (AAD)  to support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must   be   a  base64-encoded  UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a  string-string  map.  To  use this
                                          setting,   you   must    also    set
                                          Server-side   encryption  (S3Server-

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,   specify  the  customer
                                          master key (CMK) that  you  want  to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType) to  AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you set  Server-side  encryption  to
                                          AWS  KMS  but  don't  specify  a CMK
                                          here, AWS uses the AWS  managed  CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                        HlsGroupSettings -> (structure)
                            Settings  related  to your HLS output package. For

                            tion,  include  this object and any required chil-
                            dren when you set Type, under OutputGroupSettings,
                            to HLS_GROUP_SETTINGS.

                            AdMarkers -> (list)
                               Choose  one or more ad marker types to decorate
                               your Apple HLS manifest. This setting does  not
                               determine whether SCTE-35 markers appear in the
                               outputs themselves.

                               (string)
                                   Ad marker for Apple HLS manifest.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates  one  top-level
                               .m3u8 HLS manifest for each HLS output group in
                               your job. This default manifest references  ev-
                               ery output in the output group. To create addi-
                               tional top-level  manifests  that  reference  a
                               subset  of  the  outputs  in  the output group,
                               specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional HLS
                                   manifest  that you want the service to gen-
                                   erate for this output group. Each  manifest
                                   can reference a different subset of outputs
                                   in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds  to  the  name  of this manifest to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the  other  main manifests in the output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main  manifest  for  your  HLS  group is
                                      film-name.m3u8. If you  enter  "-no-pre-
                                      mium"  for  this  setting, then the file
                                      name  the  service  generates  for  this
                                      top-level  manifest is film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.m3u8. For HLS output groups,  spec-
                                      ify  a manifestNameModifier that is dif-
                                      ferent from the nameModifier of the out-
                                      put.  The  service  uses the output name
                                      modifier to create unique names for  the
                                      individual variant manifests.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this

                            BaseUrl -> (string)
                               A partial URI prefix that will be prepended  to
                               each  output  in  the  media .m3u8 file. Can be

                            CaptionSegmentLengthControl -> (string)
                               Set Caption segment length control (CaptionSeg-
                               mentLengthControl) to Match video (MATCH_VIDEO)
                               to create caption segments that align with  the
                               video  segments  from the first video output in
                               this output group. For example,  if  the  video
                               segments  are  2 seconds long, your WebVTT seg-
                               ments will also be 2 seconds long. Keep the de-
                               fault  setting, Large segments (LARGE_SEGMENTS)
                               to create caption segments that are 300 seconds
                               long.

                            ClientCache -> (string)
                               Disable  this  setting  only when your workflow
                               requires the #EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:no tag.  Other-
                               wise,  keep the default value Enabled (ENABLED)
                               and control caching in your video  distribution
                               set up. For example, use the Cache-Control http
                               header.

                            CodecSpecification -> (string)
                               Specification to use (RFC-6381 or  the  default
                               RFC-4281) during m3u8 playlist generation.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will
                               vary based on the type of destination

                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for
                                          MediaConvert to apply to  this  out-

                                   Encryption -> (structure)
                                      Settings  for  how  your job outputs are
                                      encrypted as they are uploaded to Amazon
                                      S3.

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                          of  the  key for the setting KMS ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For
                                          more  information  about  encryption

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            DirectoryStructure -> (string)
                               Indicates whether segments should be placed  in
                               subdirectories.

                            Encryption -> (structure)

                               ConstantInitializationVector -> (string)
                                   This is a 128-bit, 16-byte hex value repre-
                                   sented by a 32-character  text  string.  If
                                   this parameter is not set then the Initial-
                                   ization Vector will follow the segment num-
                                   ber by default.

                               EncryptionMethod -> (string)
                                   Encrypts  the  segments  with the given en-
                                   cryption scheme. Leave  blank  to  disable.
                                   Selecting  'Disabled'  in the web interface
                                   also disables encryption.

                               InitializationVectorInManifest -> (string)
                                   The Initialization Vector is a 128-bit num-
                                   ber  used  in  conjunction with the key for
                                   encrypting blocks. If set to INCLUDE,  Ini-
                                   tialization  Vector  is listed in the mani-
                                   fest. Otherwise  Initialization  Vector  is
                                   not in the manifest.

                               OfflineEncrypted -> (string)

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth,  use these settings when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key  provider. If your output group type is
                                   CMAF, use the SpekeKeyProviderCmaf settings
                                   instead.

                                   CertificateArn -> (string)
                                      If you want your key provider to encrypt
                                      the content keys that it provides to Me-

                                   the interval you specify in thumbnailInter-
                                   val.

                               ThumbnailHeight -> (integer)
                                   Height  of  each thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Leave blank  to  maintain
                                   aspect  ratio with thumbnail width. If fol-
                                   lowing the aspect ratio would lead to a to-
                                   tal tile height greater than 4096, then the
                                   job will be rejected. Must be divisible  by
                                   2.

                               ThumbnailInterval -> (double)
                                   Enter the interval, in seconds, that Media-
                                   Convert uses to generate thumbnails. If the
                                   interval  you  enter doesn't align with the
                                   output frame rate,  MediaConvert  automati-
                                   cally rounds the interval to align with the
                                   output frame rate. For example, if the out-
                                   put  frame  rate is 29.97 frames per second
                                   and you enter 5, MediaConvert  uses  a  150
                                   frame interval to generate thumbnails.

                               ThumbnailWidth -> (integer)
                                   Width  of  each  thumbnail within each tile
                                   image, in pixels. Default is 312.  Must  be
                                   divisible by 8.

                               TileHeight -> (integer)
                                   Number  of  thumbnails  in each column of a
                                   tile image. Set a value between 2 and 2048.
                                   Must be divisible by 2.

                               TileWidth -> (integer)
                                   Number  of thumbnails in each row of a tile
                                   image. Set a value between 1 and 512.

                            ManifestCompression -> (string)

                            ManifestDurationFormat -> (string)
                               Indicates whether the  output  manifest  should
                               use floating point values for segment duration.

                            MinFinalSegmentLength -> (double)
                               Keep  this  setting  at the default value of 0,
                               unless you are troubleshooting a  problem  with
                               how devices play back the end of your video as-
                               set. If you know that player devices are  hang-
                               ing  on the final segment of your video because
                               the length of your final segment is too  short,
                               use  this  setting  to  specify a minimum final
                               segment length, in seconds. Choose a value that
                               is  greater  than  or  equal to 1 and less than
                               your segment length. When you specify  a  value
                               for  this setting, the encoder will combine any
                               final segment that is shorter than  the  length
                               that you specify with the previous segment. For
                               example, your segment length is 3  seconds  and
                               your final segment is .5 seconds without a min-
                               imum final segment length;  when  you  set  the
                               minimum  final  segment length to 1, your final
                               segment is 3.5 seconds.

                            MinSegmentLength -> (integer)
                               When set, Minimum Segment Size is  enforced  by
                               looking  ahead  and  back  within the specified
                               range for a nearby avail and extending the seg-

                            OutputSelection -> (string)
                               Indicates   whether  the  .m3u8  manifest  file
                               should be generated for this HLS output group.

                            ProgramDateTime -> (string)
                               Includes  or  excludes  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME
                               tag  in .m3u8 manifest files. The value is cal-
                               culated as follows: either the program date and
                               time  are  initialized using the input timecode
                               source, or the time is  initialized  using  the
                               input  timecode source and the date is initial-
                               ized using the timestamp_offset.

                            ProgramDateTimePeriod -> (integer)
                               Period of insertion of  EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME

                               #EXT-X-BYTERANGE  tags  to  index  segment  for
                               playback.

                            SegmentLength -> (integer)
                               Specify the length, in whole seconds,  of  each
                               segment. When you don't specify a value, Media-
                               Convert defaults to 10. Related  settings:  Use
                               Segment  length  control (SegmentLengthControl)

                               value  strictly.  Use  Segment control (HlsSeg-
                               mentControl) to  specify  whether  MediaConvert
                               creates  separate  segment files or one content
                               file that has  metadata  to  mark  the  segment

                               Specify  how you want MediaConvert to determine
                               the segment length.  Choose  Exact  (EXACT)  to
                               have  the encoder use the exact length that you
                               specify with the setting Segment  length  (Seg-
                               mentLength).   This   might   result  in  extra
                               I-frames. Choose Multiple of GOP (GOP_MULTIPLE)
                               to  have  the  encoder  round  up  the  segment
                               lengths to match the next GOP boundary.

                            SegmentsPerSubdirectory -> (integer)
                               Number of segments to write to  a  subdirectory

                               set to SPEC\_COMPLIANT, the segment target  du-
                               ration  is  rounded  up  to the nearest integer
                               value if fraction seconds are greater  than  or
                               equal  to 0.5 (>= 0.5) and rounded down if less
                               than 0.5 (<0.5). You may need to use LEGACY  if
                               your client needs to ensure that the target du-
                               ration is always longer than the  actual  dura-
                               tion of the segment. Some older players may ex-

                               duration of a track in a segment is longer than
                               the target duration.

                            TimedMetadataId3Frame -> (string)
                               Specify the type of the ID3  frame  (timedMeta-
                               dataId3Frame) to use for ID3 timestamps (timed-
                               MetadataId3Period) in your output.  To  include
                               ID3  timestamps:  Specify  PRIV  (PRIV) or TDRL
                               (TDRL) and set ID3 metadata (timedMetadata)  to
                               Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH). To exclude ID3 time-
                               stamps: Set ID3 timestamp frame  type  to  None
                               (NONE).

                            TimedMetadataId3Period -> (integer)
                               Specify  the  interval  in seconds to write ID3
                               timestamps in your output. The first  timestamp
                               starts at the output timecode and date, and in-
                               creases incrementally with each ID3  timestamp.
                               To  use  the  default  interval  of 10 seconds:
                               Leave blank. To include this metadata  in  your
                               output:  Set  ID3  timestamp frame type (timed-
                               MetadataId3Frame)  to  PRIV  (PRIV)   or   TDRL
                               (TDRL), and set ID3 metadata (timedMetadata) to
                               Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH).

                            TimestampDeltaMilliseconds -> (integer)
                               Provides an extra millisecond delta  offset  to
                               fine tune the timestamps.

                            AdditionalManifests -> (list)
                               By default, the service creates one .ism Micro-
                               soft Smooth Streaming manifest for each  Micro-
                               soft Smooth Streaming output group in your job.
                               This default manifest references  every  output
                               in the output group. To create additional mani-
                               fests that reference a subset of the outputs in
                               the output group, specify a list of them here.

                               (structure)
                                   Specify the details for each additional Mi-
                                   crosoft Smooth Streaming manifest that  you
                                   want  the service to generate for this out-
                                   put group. Each manifest  can  reference  a
                                   different subset of outputs in the group.

                                   ManifestNameModifier -> (string)
                                      Specify a name modifier that the service
                                      adds to the name  of  this  manifest  to
                                      make it different from the file names of
                                      the other main manifests in  the  output
                                      group. For example, say that the default
                                      main manifest for your Microsoft  Smooth
                                      group  is  film-name.ismv.  If you enter
                                      "-no-premium" for this setting, then the
                                      file name the service generates for this
                                      top-level manifest is  film-name-no-pre-
                                      mium.ismv.

                                   SelectedOutputs -> (list)
                                      Specify  the  outputs that you want this

                               Smooth output group into a single audio stream.

                            Destination -> (string)
                               Use Destination (Destination) to specify the S3
                               output location and the output  filename  base.
                               Destination  accepts format identifiers. If you
                               do not specify the base filename  in  the  URI,
                               the  service will use the filename of the input
                               file. If your job has multiple inputs, the ser-
                               vice uses the filename of the first input file.

                            DestinationSettings -> (structure)
                               Settings  associated with the destination. Will

                                      the outputs in this output  group.  When
                                      you don't use this setting, S3 automati-
                                      cally applies the default access control
                                      list PRIVATE.

                                      CannedAcl -> (string)
                                          Choose  an  Amazon S3 canned ACL for

                                      EncryptionType -> (string)
                                          Specify  how you want your data keys
                                          managed. AWS uses data keys  to  en-
                                          crypt  your  content.  AWS  also en-
                                          crypts the data keys themselves, us-
                                          ing a customer master key (CMK), and
                                          then stores the encrypted data  keys
                                          alongside  your  encrypted  content.
                                          Use this setting  to  specify  which
                                          AWS  service  manages  the  CMK. For
                                          simplest set up,  choose  Amazon  S3
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_S3).  If you
                                          want your master key to  be  managed
                                          by AWS Key Management Service (KMS),
                                          choose AWS KMS  (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYP-
                                          TION_KMS).   By  default,  when  you
                                          choose AWS KMS,  KMS  uses  the  AWS
                                          managed  customer  master  key (CMK)
                                          associated with Amazon S3 to encrypt
                                          your  data  keys. You can optionally
                                          choose to specify a different,  cus-
                                          tomer managed CMK. Do so by specify-
                                          ing the Amazon Resource  Name  (ARN)
                                          of  the  key for the setting KMS ARN
                                          (kmsKeyArn).

                                      KmsEncryptionContext -> (string)
                                          Optionally, specify  the  encryption
                                          context  that you want to use along-
                                          side your KMS key. AWS KMS uses this
                                          encryption context as additional au-
                                          thenticated data  (AAD)  to  support
                                          authenticated encryption. This value
                                          must  be  a   base64-encoded   UTF-8
                                          string holding JSON which represents
                                          a string-string  map.  To  use  this
                                          setting,    you    must   also   set
                                          Server-side  encryption   (S3Server-
                                          SideEncryptionType)   to   AWS   KMS
                                          (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS).    For

                                      KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                                          Optionally,  specify  the   customer
                                          master  key  (CMK)  that you want to
                                          use to encrypt the data key that AWS
                                          uses to encrypt your output content.
                                          Enter the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                                          of the CMK. To use this setting, you
                                          must also set Server-side encryption
                                          (S3ServerSideEncryptionType)  to AWS
                                          KMS (SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_KMS). If
                                          you  set  Server-side  encryption to
                                          AWS KMS  but  don't  specify  a  CMK
                                          here,  AWS  uses the AWS managed CMK
                                          associated with Amazon S3.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               If you are using  DRM,  set  DRM  System  (MsS-
                               moothEncryptionSettings)  to  specify the value
                               SpekeKeyProvider.

                               SpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)
                                   If your output group type is HLS, DASH,  or
                                   Microsoft  Smooth,  use these settings when
                                   doing DRM encryption with a SPEKE-compliant
                                   key  provider. If your output group type is

                               (structure)
                                   Settings related to one audio  tab  on  the
                                   MediaConvert  console. In your job JSON, an
                                   instance of AudioDescription is  equivalent
                                   to  one  audio tab in the console. Usually,
                                   one audio tab corresponds to one output au-
                                   dio track. Depending on how you set up your
                                   input audio selectors and whether  you  use
                                   audio  selector  groups,  one audio tab can
                                   correspond  to  a  group  of  output  audio
                                   tracks.

                                   AudioChannelTaggingSettings -> (structure)
                                      When  you  mimic  a  multi-channel audio
                                      layout   with   multiple    mono-channel
                                      tracks,  you can tag each channel layout
                                      manually. For example, you would tag the
                                      tracks  that  contain  your left, right,
                                      and center audio with  Left  (L),  Right
                                      (R),  and Center (C), respectively. When
                                      you don't specify a value,  MediaConvert
                                      labels  your  track as Center (C) by de-
                                      fault. To use audio layout tagging, your
                                      output  must  be  in  a QuickTime (.mov)
                                      container; your audio codec must be AAC,
                                      WAV,  or  AIFF; and you must set up your
                                      audio track to have only one channel.

                                      ChannelTag -> (string)
                                          You  can  add   a   tag   for   this
                                          mono-channel  audio  track  to mimic
                                          its  placement  in  a  multi-channel
                                          layout.  For  example, if this track
                                          is the left surround channel, choose
                                          Left surround (LS).

                                      When  set  to FOLLOW_INPUT, if the input
                                      contains an  ISO  639  audio_type,  then
                                      that value is passed through to the out-

                                      Settings  related to audio encoding. The
                                      settings in this group vary depending on
                                      the value that you choose for your audio
                                      codec.

                                      AacSettings -> (structure)
                                          Required when you set (Codec)  under

                                          to the value AAC.  The  service  ac-
                                          cepts  one of two mutually exclusive
                                          groups of AAC settings--VBR and CBR.
                                          To  select  one  of these modes, set
                                          the value of  Bitrate  control  mode
                                          (rateControlMode) to "VBR" or "CBR".
                                          In VBR mode, you control  the  audio
                                          quality with the setting VBR quality
                                          (vbrQuality). In CBR mode,  you  use
                                          the  setting  Bitrate (bitrate). De-
                                          faults and valid  values  depend  on
                                          the rate control mode.

                                             must contain pre-mixed audio; the

                                             audio  +  audio description (AD).
                                             In this case,  the  encoder  will
                                             use  any  values  you provide for

                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep

                                   IFrameOnlyManifest -> (string)
                                      Choose Include (INCLUDE) to have  Media-
                                      Convert  generate  an HLS child manifest
                                      that lists only the  I-frames  for  this
                                      rendition,  in  addition to your regular
                                      manifest for this rendition.  You  might
                                      use  this manifest as part of a workflow
                                      that creates preview functions for  your
                                      video.   MediaConvert   adds   both  the
                                      I-frame only child manifest and the reg-
                                      ular  child manifest to the parent mani-
                                      fest. When you don't  need  the  I-frame
                                      only  child  manifest,  keep the default
                                      value Exclude (EXCLUDE).

                                   KlvMetadata -> (string)
                                      To include key-length-value metadata  in
                                      this  output: Set KLV metadata insertion
                                      to Passthrough. MediaConvert  reads  KLV
                                      metadata   present  in  your  input  and
                                      writes each instance to a separate event
                                      message  box in the output, according to
                                      MISB ST1910.1. To exclude this KLV meta-
                                      data: Set KLV metadata insertion to None
                                      or leave blank.

                                   Scte35Esam -> (string)
                                      Use this setting only when  you  specify
                                      SCTE-35 markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT
                                      to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at
                                      the insertion points that you specify in
                                      an ESAM XML document. Provide the  docu-

                                   Scte35Source -> (string)
                                      Ignore  this  setting  unless  you  have
                                      SCTE-35  markers  in  your  input  video
                                      file.  Choose  Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH)
                                      if you want SCTE-35 markers that  appear
                                      in  your  input  to  also appear in this
                                      output. Choose None (NONE) if you  don't
                                      want  those SCTE-35 markers in this out-
                                      put.

                                   TimedMetadata -> (string)
                                      To include ID3 metadata in this  output:
                                      Set   ID3  metadata  (timedMetadata)  to
                                      Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH). Specify  this
                                      ID3  metadata in Custom ID3 metadata in-
                                      serter (timedMetadataInsertion).  Media-
                                      Convert  writes  each  instance  of  ID3
                                      metadata in  a  separate  Event  Message
                                      (eMSG)  box.  To  exclude this ID3 meta-
                                      data: Set ID3 metadata to None (NONE) or

                               Container -> (string)
                                   Container  for this output. Some containers
                                   require a container settings object. If not
                                   specified,  the default object will be cre-
                                   ated.

                               F4vSettings -> (structure)
                                   Settings for F4v container

                                   MoovPlacement -> (string)
                                      If set to PROGRESSIVE_DOWNLOAD, the MOOV
                                      atom  is  relocated  to the beginning of
                                      the archive as required for  progressive
                                      downloading. Otherwise it is placed nor-
                                      mally at the end.

                               M2tsSettings -> (structure)
                                   MPEG-2 TS container settings.  These  apply
                                   to  outputs in a File output group when the
                                   output's   container   (ContainerType)   is
                                   MPEG-2  Transport  Stream  (M2TS). In these
                                   assets, data is organized  by  the  program
                                   map table (PMT). Each transport stream pro-
                                   gram contains subsets  of  data,  including
                                   audio,  video,  and metadata. Each of these
                                   subsets  of  data  has  a  numerical  label
                                   called  a  packet  identifier  (PID).  Each
                                   transport stream program corresponds to one
                                   MediaConvert  output.  The  PMT  lists  the
                                   types of data in a program along with their
                                   PID. Downstream systems and players use the
                                   program map table to look up  the  PID  for
                                   each type of data it accesses and then uses
                                   the PIDs to locate specific data within the
                                   asset.

                                   AudioBufferModel -> (string)
                                      Selects  between the DVB and ATSC buffer
                                      models for Dolby Digital audio.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put  will  be  consumed  by a downstream
                                      repackaging workflow that  is  sensitive
                                      to  very  small duration differences be-
                                      tween video and audio. For  this  situa-
                                      tion,   choose   Match   video  duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).  In  all   other
                                      cases,  keep  the default value, Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When  you  choose  Match video duration,
                                      MediaConvert  pads  the   output   audio
                                      streams  with  silence  or trims them to
                                      ensure that the total duration  of  each
                                      audio  stream is at least as long as the
                                      total duration of the video stream.  Af-
                                      ter   padding  or  trimming,  the  audio
                                      stream duration  is  no  more  than  one
                                      frame  longer than the video stream. Me-
                                      diaConvert  applies  audio  padding   or
                                      trimming  only  to  the  end of the last
                                      segment of the output.  For  unsegmented
                                      outputs,  MediaConvert adds padding only
                                      to the end of the file.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, any minor discrepan-
                                      cies between audio  and  video  duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   AudioFramesPerPes -> (integer)
                                      The number of audio frames to insert for
                                      each PES packet.

                                   AudioPids -> (list)
                                      Specify the  packet  identifiers  (PIDs)
                                      for any elementary audio streams you in-
                                      clude in this output.  Specify  multiple
                                      PIDs  as  a  JSON  array. Default is the
                                      range 482-492.

                                      (integer)

                                   Bitrate -> (integer)
                                      Specify the output bitrate of the trans-
                                      port  stream in bits per second. Setting
                                      to 0 lets the muxer automatically deter-
                                      mine the appropriate bitrate. Other com-
                                      mon values  are  3750000,  7500000,  and
                                      15000000.

                                   BufferModel -> (string)
                                      Controls  what  buffer  model to use for
                                      accurate interleaving. If set to  MULTI-
                                      PLEX, use multiplex buffer model. If set
                                      to NONE, this can lead to lower latency,
                                      but  low-memory  devices may not be able
                                      to play back the stream  without  inter-
                                      ruptions.

                                   DataPTSControl -> (string)
                                      If  you select ALIGN_TO_VIDEO, MediaCon-
                                      vert writes captions  and  data  packets
                                      with Presentation Timestamp (PTS) values
                                      greater than or equal to the first video
                                      packet  PTS (MediaConvert drops captions
                                      and data packets with  lesser  PTS  val-
                                      ues).  Keep  the default value (AUTO) to
                                      allow all PTS values.

                                   DvbNitSettings -> (structure)
                                      Use these settings to insert a DVB  Net-
                                      work  Information  Table  (NIT)  in  the

                                      Selects  which PIDs to place EBP markers
                                      on. They can either be  placed  only  on
                                      the  video PID, or on both the video PID
                                      and all audio PIDs. Only applicable when

                                      Keep the default value (DEFAULT)  unless
                                      you know that your audio EBP markers are
                                      incorrectly appearing before your  video
                                      EBP  markers.  To  correct this problem,

                                      to  Passthrough.  MediaConvert reads KLV
                                      metadata  present  in  your  input   and
                                      passes  it  through to the output trans-
                                      port stream. To exclude this  KLV  meta-
                                      data: Set KLV metadata insertion to None
                                      or leave blank.

                                      (PCRs)  inserted  into   the   transport
                                      stream.

                                   MinEbpInterval -> (integer)
                                      When set, enforces that Encoder Boundary
                                      Points do not come within the  specified
                                      time  interval  of each other by looking
                                      ahead at input video. If another EBP  is
                                      going  to  come  in within the specified
                                      time interval, the current  EBP  is  not
                                      emitted,  and the segment is "stretched"
                                      to the next marker. The lookahead  value
                                      does  not add latency to the system. The
                                      Live Event must be configured  elsewhere
                                      to create sufficient latency to make the
                                      lookahead accurate.

                                      input audio and an  equivalent  ID3  tag
                                      will be inserted in the output.

                                   NullPacketBitrate -> (double)

                                      stream. This can be used if a downstream
                                      encryption system requires periodic null
                                      packets.

                                      gram Clock Reference value  is  inserted
                                      for  every  Packetized Elementary Stream
                                      (PES) header.  This  is  effective  only
                                      when  the  PCR  PID  is  the same as the
                                      video or audio elementary stream.

                                      value,  the  service  will use the value
                                      for Video PID (VideoPid).

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)

                                      Specify the packet identifier  (PID)  of
                                      the  private metadata stream. Default is
                                      503.

                                   ProgramNumber -> (integer)
                                      Use Program  number  (programNumber)  to
                                      specify  the  program number used in the
                                      program map table (PMT) for this output.
                                      Default  is  1. Program numbers and pro-
                                      gram map  tables  are  parts  of  MPEG-2
                                      transport  stream  containers,  used for
                                      organizing data.

                                   RateMode -> (string)
                                      When set to CBR,  inserts  null  packets
                                      into  transport stream to fill specified
                                      bitrate. When set to  VBR,  the  bitrate
                                      setting acts as the maximum bitrate, but
                                      the output will not be padded up to that
                                      bitrate.

                                   Scte35Esam -> (structure)

                                   SegmentationMarkers -> (string)
                                      Inserts  segmentation  markers  at  each
                                      segmentation_time  period.  rai_segstart
                                      sets  the Random Access Indicator bit in
                                      the adaptation field. rai_adapt sets the

                                   SegmentationStyle -> (string)
                                      The segmentation  style  parameter  con-
                                      trols  how  segmentation markers are in-
                                      serted into the transport  stream.  With
                                      avails, it is possible that segments may
                                      be truncated, which can influence  where
                                      future   segmentation  markers  are  in-
                                      serted. When  a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "reset_cadence"  is  selected and a seg-
                                      ment is truncated due to  an  avail,  we
                                      will  reset  the  segmentation  cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      have a duration of of $segmentation_time
                                      seconds. When a  segmentation  style  of
                                      "maintain_cadence"  is  selected  and  a
                                      segment is truncated due to an avail, we
                                      will not reset the segmentation cadence.
                                      This means the subsequent  segment  will
                                      likely  be  truncated  as well. However,
                                      all segments after that will have a  du-
                                      ration  of  $segmentation_time  seconds.
                                      Note that EBP lookahead is a slight  ex-
                                      ception to this rule.

                                   SegmentationTime -> (double)
                                      Specify  the length, in seconds, of each
                                      segment. Required unless markers is  set
                                      to _none_.

                                   TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 meta-
                                      data stream in the transport stream.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      Specify the ID for the transport  stream
                                      itself in the program map table for this
                                      output. Transport stream IDs and program
                                      map tables are parts of MPEG-2 transport
                                      stream containers, used  for  organizing
                                      data.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Specify  the  packet identifier (PID) of
                                      the  elementary  video  stream  in   the
                                      transport stream.

                               M3u8Settings -> (structure)
                                   These  settings relate to the MPEG-2 trans-
                                   port stream (MPEG2-TS)  container  for  the
                                   MPEG2-TS segments in your HLS outputs.

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive

                                      tween  video  and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration of the video stream. Af-
                                      ter  padding  or  trimming,  the   audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                                      diaConvert   applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                      for every Packetized  Elementary  Stream
                                      (PES)  header.  This parameter is effec-
                                      tive only when the PCR PID is  the  same
                                      as the video or audio elementary stream.

                                   PcrPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet  Identifier  (PID) of the Program

                                      stream.  When no value is given, the en-
                                      coder will assign the same value as  the
                                      Video PID.

                                   PmtInterval -> (integer)

                                      put:  set ID3 metadata to None (NONE) or
                                      leave blank.

                                   TimedMetadataPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of the ID3 meta-
                                      data stream in the transport stream.

                                   TransportStreamId -> (integer)
                                      The  value  of  the  transport stream ID
                                      field in the Program Map Table.

                                   VideoPid -> (integer)
                                      Packet Identifier (PID) of  the  elemen-
                                      tary   video  stream  in  the  transport
                                      stream.

                               MovSettings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to your QuickTime MOV
                                   output container.

                                   ClapAtom -> (string)
                                      When enabled, include 'clap' atom if ap-
                                      propriate for the video output settings.

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the 'ctts' (composition time to  sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a
                                      'cslg' (composition shift  least  great-
                                      est)  box  will  be included per 14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   Mpeg2FourCCControl -> (string)
                                      When  set  to  XDCAM, writes MPEG2 video
                                      streams into the  QuickTime  file  using
                                      XDCAM  fourcc codes. This increases com-
                                      patibility with Apple editors and  play-
                                      ers, but may decrease compatibility with
                                      other players. Only applicable when  the
                                      video codec is MPEG2.

                                   PaddingControl -> (string)
                                      To  make  this  output  compatible  with
                                      Omenon, keep the default value,  OMNEON.
                                      Unless  you  need  Omneon compatibility,
                                      set this value to NONE.  When  you  keep
                                      the  default value, OMNEON, MediaConvert
                                      increases the length of  the  edit  list
                                      atom.  This  might cause file rejections
                                      when a  recipient  of  the  output  file
                                      doesn't expct this extra padding.

                                   Reference -> (string)
                                      Always keep the default value (SELF_CON-
                                      TAINED) for this setting.

                               Mp4Settings -> (structure)
                                   These settings relate to  your  MP4  output
                                   container.  You  can create audio only out-

                                   AudioDuration -> (string)
                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive

                                      tween  video  and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration of the video stream. Af-
                                      ter  padding  or  trimming,  the   audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                                      diaConvert   applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   CslgAtom -> (string)
                                      When  enabled,  file  composition  times
                                      will start at zero, composition times in
                                      the 'ctts' (composition time to  sample)
                                      box for B-frames will be negative, and a
                                      'cslg' (composition shift  least  great-
                                      est)  box  will  be included per 14496-1
                                      amendment 1. This improves compatibility
                                      with Apple players and tools.

                                   CttsVersion -> (integer)
                                      Ignore this setting unless compliance to
                                      the CTTS box version specification  mat-
                                      ters  in  your workflow. Specify a value
                                      of 1 to set your CTTS box version  to  1
                                      and  make your output compliant with the
                                      specification. When you specify a  value
                                      of  1, you must also set CSLG atom (csl-
                                      gAtom) to the value  INCLUDE.  Keep  the
                                      default  value  0  to  set your CTTS box
                                      version to 0. This can provide  backward
                                      compatibility for some players and pack-
                                      agers.

                                   FreeSpaceBox -> (string)
                                      Inserts a free-space box immediately af-
                                      ter the moov box.

                                   Mp4MajorBrand -> (string)
                                      Overrides the "Major Brand" field in the

                                      have MediaConvert mark up your DASH man-
                                      ifest  with  elements  for  embedded 608
                                      captions. This  markup  isn't  generally
                                      required, but some video players require
                                      it to discover  and  play  embedded  608
                                      captions.  Keep  the  default value, Ex-

                                      out.  When you enable this setting, this
                                      is the markup that MediaConvert includes
                                      in your manifest:

                                      Specify this setting only when your out-
                                      put will be  consumed  by  a  downstream
                                      repackaging  workflow  that is sensitive
                                      to very small duration  differences  be-
                                      tween  video  and audio. For this situa-
                                      tion,  choose   Match   video   duration
                                      (MATCH_VIDEO_DURATION).   In  all  other
                                      cases, keep the default  value,  Default
                                      codec duration (DEFAULT_CODEC_DURATION).
                                      When you choose  Match  video  duration,
                                      MediaConvert   pads   the  output  audio
                                      streams with silence or  trims  them  to
                                      ensure  that  the total duration of each
                                      audio stream is at least as long as  the
                                      total  duration of the video stream. Af-
                                      ter  padding  or  trimming,  the   audio
                                      stream  duration  is  no  more  than one
                                      frame longer than the video stream.  Me-
                                      diaConvert   applies  audio  padding  or
                                      trimming only to the  end  of  the  last
                                      segment  of  the output. For unsegmented
                                      outputs, MediaConvert adds padding  only
                                      to  the  end  of the file. When you keep
                                      the default value, any minor  discrepan-
                                      cies  between  audio  and video duration
                                      will depend on your output audio codec.

                                   CaptionContainerType -> (string)
                                      Use this setting  only  in  DASH  output
                                      groups that include sidecar TTML or IMSC
                                      captions. You specify  sidecar  captions
                                      in a separate output from your audio and
                                      video. Choose Raw (RAW) for captions  in
                                      a  single  XML  file in a raw container.

                                      Use  this  setting only when you specify
                                      SCTE-35 markers from ESAM. Choose INSERT
                                      to put SCTE-35 markers in this output at
                                      the insertion points that you specify in

                                      file. Choose  Passthrough  (PASSTHROUGH)
                                      if  you want SCTE-35 markers that appear
                                      in your input to  also  appear  in  this
                                      output.  Choose None (NONE) if you don't
                                      want those SCTE-35 markers in this  out-

                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your

                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify the GOP length (keyframe in-
                                          terval)  in frames. With AV1, Media-
                                          Convert doesn't support  GOP  length
                                          in   seconds.  This  value  must  be
                                          greater  than  zero  and  preferably
                                          equal  to 1 + ((numberBFrames + 1) *
                                          x), where x is an integer value.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      NumberBFramesBetweenReferenceFrames   ->
                                      (integer)
                                          Specify from the number of B-frames,
                                          in the range of 0-15. For AV1 encod-
                                          ing, we recommend  using  7  or  15.
                                          Choose  a  larger number for a lower
                                          bitrate  and  smaller   file   size;
                                          choose  a  smaller number for better
                                          video quality.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)
                                          Settings for  quality-defined  vari-
                                          able bitrate encoding with the H.265
                                          codec. Use these settings only  when
                                          you  set  QVBR for Rate control mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-
                                             trolMode) to  QVBR.  Specify  the
                                             target  quality  level  for  this
                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to
                                             maintain  the  video quality that
                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,

                                          tures,  this value must be less than
                                          or equal to the number of macroblock
                                          rows.  For interlaced pictures, this
                                          value must be less than or equal  to
                                          half the number of macroblock rows.

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)

                                          ABLED),   to   adjust   quantization
                                          within  each  frame based on spatial
                                          variation  of  content   complexity.
                                          When  you  enable  this feature, the
                                          encoder uses  fewer  bits  on  areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with no noticeable  visual  degrada-
                                          tion  and  uses  more  bits on areas
                                          where any small distortion  will  be
                                          noticeable.   For  example,  complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer   bits   and  smooth  textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the
                                          viewer's  attention is likely to be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing

                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course  of the output. Follow behav-

                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                          You must  also  set  Interlace  mode
                                          (interlaceMode)  to  a  value  other

                                          value to Enabled (ENABLED) to reduce
                                          I-frame  pop. I-frame pop appears as
                                          a visual flicker that can arise when
                                          the  encoder  saves  bits by copying
                                          some  macroblocks  many  times  from
                                          frame  to  frame, and then refreshes
                                          them at the I-frame. When you enable
                                          this  setting,  the  encoder updates

                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate

                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-

                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to

                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this value as frames or seconds  de-
                                          pending  on the value you choose for
                                          GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).  If
                                          you  want  to  allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set
                                          GOP  mode  control  to  Auto in each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this

                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-

                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)

                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top

                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create

                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use

                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the

                                          If the  source  is  interlaced,  the
                                          output  will  be interlaced with the
                                          same polarity as the source. If  the
                                          source  is  progressive,  the output
                                          will be interlaced  with  top  field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part of the I-frame ca-
                                          dence and the I-frames that  it  in-
                                          serts for Scene change detection. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable

                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When  you explicitly specify a value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines   whether   to   skip   a  ca-
                                          dence-driven I-frame  by  the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within 5 frames  of  a  scene-change
                                          I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one  GOP  is shrunk slightly and one
                                          GOP is stretched slightly. When  the
                                          cadence-driven  I-frames are farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                          use automatic behavior to allow  the
                                          transcoder  to choose the best value
                                          based on characteristics of your in-

                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect

                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample,  the value for parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect

                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Use  Quality tuning level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel) to  choose  how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for output video  quality.  The  de-
                                          fault   behavior  is  faster,  lower

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use this setting  only  when  you
                                             set  Rate  control mode (RateCon-

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the  right  number of bits to use
                                             for each part  of  the  video  to

                                             you specify. When  you  keep  the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks a quality  level  for  you,
                                             based  on characteristics of your
                                             input video.  If  you  prefer  to
                                             specify  a quality level, specify
                                             a number from 1 through  10.  Use
                                             higher  numbers for greater qual-
                                             ity. Level 10 results  in  nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level for most  broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes  is  between  6 and 9.

                                             that  is  between  whole numbers.
                                             For example,  if  you  want  your
                                             QVBR  quality  level  to be 7.33,

                                          to  comply with a specification that
                                          requires a specific  value.  If  you

                                          ment, we recommend that  you  adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness  (sharpness)  or  by enabling a
                                          noise reducer filter  (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).   The  Softness  (softness)
                                          setting specifies  the  quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, for flat quan-
                                          tization.  Choose  the value 1 or 16
                                          to use  the  default  JVT  softening
                                          quantization   matricies   from  the
                                          H.264 specification. Choose a  value
                                          from  17 to 128 to use planar inter-
                                          polation. Increasing values from  17
                                          to  128  result in increasing reduc-
                                          tion  of  high-frequency  data.  The
                                          value  128  results  in  the softest
                                          video.

                                          When you  set  H264AdaptiveQuantiza-
                                          tion to a value other than AUTO, the
                                          default value  for  H264SpatialAdap-
                                          tiveQuantization   is  Enabled  (EN-
                                          ABLED). Keep this default  value  to
                                          adjust   quantization   within  each
                                          frame based on spatial variation  of
                                          content  complexity. When you enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits  on areas that can sustain more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation  and  uses  more bits on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex textured blocks are  encoded
                                          with  fewer bits and smooth textured
                                          blocks are encoded with  more  bits.
                                          Enabling  this  feature  will almost
                                          always improve your  video  quality.
                                          Note,   though,  that  this  feature
                                          doesn't take into account where  the
                                          viewer's  attention is likely to be.

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses fewer bits on areas of
                                          the frame  that  aren't  moving  and
                                          uses  more  bits  on complex objects
                                          with sharp edges that  move  a  lot.
                                          For  example,  this feature improves
                                          the readability of text  tickers  on
                                          newscasts  and scoreboards on sports
                                          matches. Enabling this feature  will
                                          almost  always  improve  your  video

                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopBReference -> (string)
                                          If  enable,  use  reference B frames
                                          for  GOP  structures  that  have   B
                                          frames > 1.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP, set this value to 5. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping the default empty value.  If
                                          you  do  explicitly specify a value,
                                          for  segmented  outputs,  don't  set
                                          this value to 0.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Use  this  setting only when you set
                                          GOP mode control  (GopSizeUnits)  to
                                          Specified, frames (FRAMES) or Speci-
                                          fied, seconds (SECONDS). Specify the
                                          GOP  length  using a whole number of
                                          frames or a decimal  value  of  sec-
                                          onds.  MediaConvert  will  interpret
                                          this value as frames or seconds  de-
                                          pending  on the value you choose for
                                          GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits).  If
                                          you  want  to  allow MediaConvert to
                                          automatically  determine  GOP  size,
                                          leave  GOP  size  blank  and set GOP
                                          mode control to Auto (AUTO). If your
                                          output group specifies HLS, DASH, or
                                          CMAF, leave GOP size blank  and  set
                                          GOP  mode  control  to  Auto in each
                                          output in your output group.

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify how  the  transcoder  deter-
                                          mines  GOP  size for this output. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic behavior, choose Auto
                                          (AUTO)  and and leave GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size)  blank.  By  default,  if  you
                                          don't specify GOP mode control (Gop-
                                          SizeUnits),  MediaConvert  will  use
                                          automatic  behavior.  If your output
                                          group specifies HLS, DASH, or  CMAF,
                                          set  GOP  mode  control  to Auto and
                                          leave GOP size blank in each  output
                                          in  your output group. To explicitly
                                          specify the GOP length, choose Spec-

                                          seconds (SECONDS) and  then  provide
                                          the  GOP  length in the related set-

                                          will be interlaced  with  top  field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum  bitrate in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second  as  5000000.  Required  when
                                          Rate control mode is QVBR.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part of the I-frame ca-
                                          dence and the I-frames that  it  in-
                                          serts for Scene change detection. We
                                          recommend   that   you   have    the
                                          transcoder automatically choose this
                                          value for you based on  characteris-
                                          tics  of your input video. To enable
                                          this automatic  behavior,  keep  the
                                          default  value  by leaving this set-
                                          ting out of your JSON job specifica-
                                          tion.  In  the  console,  do this by
                                          keeping  the  default  empty  value.
                                          When  you explicitly specify a value
                                          for this setting, the encoder deter-
                                          mines   whether   to   skip   a  ca-
                                          dence-driven I-frame  by  the  value
                                          you set. For example, if you set Min
                                          I interval (minIInterval) to 5 and a
                                          cadence-driven  I-frame  would  fall
                                          within 5 frames  of  a  scene-change
                                          I-frame,  then the encoder skips the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one  GOP  is shrunk slightly and one
                                          GOP is stretched slightly. When  the
                                          cadence-driven  I-frames are farther
                                          from the scene-change  I-frame  than
                                          the  value you set, then the encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs  surrounding  the  scene change
                                          are smaller than the  usual  cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      (integer)
                                          Specify the number of B-frames  that
                                          MediaConvert  puts between reference
                                          frames in this output. Valid  values
                                          are  whole numbers from 0 through 7.
                                          When you don't specify a value,  Me-
                                          diaConvert defaults to 2.

                                      NumberReferenceFrames -> (integer)
                                          Number  of  reference frames to use.
                                          The encoder may use  more  than  re-
                                          quested if using B-frames and/or in-

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      QvbrSettings -> (structure)

                                          codec.  Use these settings only when
                                          you set QVBR for Rate  control  mode
                                          (RateControlMode).

                                          MaxAverageBitrate -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting only when Rate
                                             control mode is QVBR and  Quality
                                             tuning  level  is  Multi-pass HQ.

                                             the  average bitrate of the video
                                             part of this output to the  value
                                             that you choose. That is, the to-
                                             tal size of the video element  is
                                             less  than  or equal to the value
                                             you set multiplied by the  number
                                             of seconds of encoded output.

                                          QvbrQualityLevel -> (integer)
                                             Use  this  setting  only when you
                                             set Rate control  mode  (RateCon-

                                             output.  MediaConvert  determines
                                             the right number of bits  to  use
                                             for  each  part  of  the video to
                                             maintain the video  quality  that
                                             you  specify.  When  you keep the
                                             default value, AUTO, MediaConvert
                                             picks  a  quality  level for you,
                                             based on characteristics of  your
                                             input  video.  If  you  prefer to
                                             specify a quality level,  specify
                                             a  number  from 1 through 10. Use
                                             higher numbers for greater  qual-
                                             ity.  Level  10 results in nearly
                                             lossless compression. The quality
                                             level  for most broadcast-quality
                                             transcodes is between  6  and  9.

                                          PAL to create a 25 fps output.  When
                                          you  enable  slow  PAL, MediaConvert
                                          relabels the video frames to 25  fps
                                          and  resamples your audio to keep it
                                          synchronized with  the  video.  Note
                                          that   enabling  this  setting  will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video.  Required  settings: You must
                                          also set Framerate to  25.  In  your
                                          JSON job specification, set (framer-

                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses  fewer  bits  on areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the
                                          viewer's attention is likely to  be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing
                                          their attention on  a  part  of  the

                                          encoder uses fewer bits on areas  of
                                          the  frame  that  aren't  moving and
                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.
                                          For example, this  feature  improves
                                          the  readability  of text tickers on
                                          newscasts and scoreboards on  sports
                                          matches.  Enabling this feature will
                                          almost  always  improve  your  video
                                          quality.  Note,  though,  that  this
                                          feature doesn't  take  into  account
                                          where   the  viewer's  attention  is
                                          likely to be. If viewers are  likely
                                          to  be focusing their attention on a
                                          part of the screen that doesn't have
                                          moving  objects  with  sharp  edges,
                                          such as sports athletes' faces,  you
                                          might  choose  to  disable this fea-

                                      TemporalIds -> (string)
                                          Enables temporal  layer  identifiers
                                          in  the  encoded  bitstream. Up to 3
                                          layers are  supported  depending  on
                                          GOP  structure: I- and P-frames form
                                          one layer,  reference  B-frames  can
                                          form  a  second layer and non-refer-

                                          to  generate a lower frame rate out-

                                          with  temporal IDs and with b-frames
                                          = 1 (i.e. IbPbPb display  order),  a
                                          decoder  could decode all the frames
                                          for full frame rate output  or  only
                                          the  I and P frames (lowest temporal
                                          layer) for a half frame rate output.

                                          in the  samples  directly.  For  MP4
                                          outputs,  when you choose HVC1, your
                                          output video might not work properly
                                          with  some  downstream  systems  and
                                          video players. The service  defaults
                                          to  marking your output as HEV1. For
                                          these outputs,  the  service  writes

                                          applies  to  the following settings:
                                          Spatial adaptive quantization  (spa-

                                          Specify  the average bitrate in bits
                                          per second.  Required  for  VBR  and
                                          CBR. For MS Smooth outputs, bitrates
                                          must be unique when rounded down  to
                                          the nearest multiple of 1000.

                                      CodecLevel -> (string)

                                          to use fewer B-frames  (which  infer
                                          information  based  on other frames)
                                          for  high-motion  portions  of   the

                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video

                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopClosedCadence -> (integer)
                                          Specify  the  relative  frequency of
                                          open to closed GOPs in this  output.
                                          For  example,  if  you want to allow
                                          four open GOPs and  then  require  a
                                          closed  GOP,  set  this  value to 5.
                                          When you create a streaming  output,
                                          we  recommend  that you keep the de-
                                          fault  value,  1,  so  that  players
                                          starting  mid-stream  receive an IDR
                                          frame as quickly as possible.  Don't
                                          set  this  value  to  0;  that would
                                          break output segmenting.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          Specify   the    interval    between
                                          keyframes, in seconds or frames, for
                                          this  output.  Default:  12  Related
                                          settings:  When  you specify the GOP
                                          size in seconds, set GOP  mode  con-

                                          seconds (SECONDS). The default value
                                          for  GOP mode control (GopSizeUnits)
                                          is Frames (FRAMES).

                                      GopSizeUnits -> (string)
                                          Specify the units for GOP size (Gop-
                                          Size).  If you don't specify a value
                                          here, by default  the  encoder  mea-
                                          sures GOP size in frames.

                                          If  your  downstream  systems   have
                                          strict  buffer requirements: Specify

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)

                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose  the  scan  line type for the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive  (PROGRESSIVE)  to create a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field first  (TOP_FIELD)  or  Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same  field polarity throughout. Use

                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the

                                          If  the  source  is  interlaced, the
                                          output will be interlaced  with  the
                                          same  polarity as the source. If the
                                          source is  progressive,  the  output
                                          will  be  interlaced  with top field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you

                                      IntraDcPrecision -> (string)
                                          Use Intra DC precision (Mpeg2IntraD-
                                          cPrecision) to set quantization pre-

                                          cients.  If  you  choose  the  value
                                          auto, the service will automatically
                                          select  the  precision  based on the
                                          per-frame compression ratio.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Maximum bitrate in bits/second.  For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      MinIInterval -> (integer)
                                          Use this setting only when you  also
                                          enable    Scene   change   detection
                                          (SceneChangeDetect).  This   setting
                                          determines  how  the encoder manages
                                          the spacing between I-frames that it
                                          inserts  as  part of the I-frame ca-
                                          dence and the I-frames that  it  in-
                                          serts  for  Scene  change detection.
                                          When you specify a  value  for  this
                                          setting,   the   encoder  determines
                                          whether  to  skip  a  cadence-driven
                                          I-frame  by  the  value you set. For
                                          example, if you set Min  I  interval
                                          (minIInterval)   to   5  and  a  ca-
                                          dence-driven  I-frame   would   fall
                                          within  5  frames  of a scene-change
                                          I-frame, then the encoder skips  the
                                          cadence-driven I-frame. In this way,
                                          one GOP is shrunk slightly  and  one
                                          GOP  is stretched slightly. When the
                                          cadence-driven I-frames are  farther
                                          from  the  scene-change I-frame than
                                          the value you set, then the  encoder
                                          leaves all I-frames in place and the
                                          GOPs surrounding  the  scene  change
                                          are  smaller  than the usual cadence
                                          GOPs.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, single-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          Use Rate control mode (Mpeg2RateCon-
                                          trolMode) to specify whether the bi-
                                          trate  is variable (vbr) or constant
                                          (cbr).

                                      ScanTypeConversionMode -> (string)
                                          Use this setting for interlaced out-
                                          puts, when your output frame rate is
                                          half of your input  frame  rate.  In
                                          this situation, choose Optimized in-
                                          terlacing  (INTERLACED_OPTIMIZE)  to
                                          create  a  better quality interlaced
                                          output. In this case, each  progres-

                                          all  other  output frame rates. With
                                          basic interlacing, MediaConvert per-
                                          forms   any  frame  rate  conversion
                                          first  and   then   interlaces   the
                                          frames.  When  you  choose Optimized
                                          interlacing and you set your  output
                                          frame  rate  to  a  value that isn't

                                          back to basic interlacing.  Required
                                          settings: To use optimized interlac-
                                          ing,   you   must    set    Telecine

                                          terlacing for hard telecine outputs.
                                          You must  also  set  Interlace  mode
                                          (interlaceMode)  to  a  value  other

                                      SceneChangeDetect -> (string)
                                          Enable  this   setting   to   insert
                                          I-frames  at  scene changes that the

                                      SlowPal -> (string)
                                          Ignore this setting unless your  in-
                                          put  frame  rate  is  23.976  or  24
                                          frames per second (fps). Enable slow
                                          PAL  to create a 25 fps output. When
                                          you enable  slow  PAL,  MediaConvert
                                          relabels  the video frames to 25 fps
                                          and resamples your audio to keep  it
                                          synchronized  with  the  video. Note
                                          that  enabling  this  setting   will
                                          slightly reduce the duration of your
                                          video. Required settings:  You  must
                                          also  set  Framerate  to 25. In your
                                          JSON job specification, set (framer-
                                          ateControl) to (SPECIFIED), (framer-
                                          ateNumerator) to 25 and  (framerate-
                                          Denominator) to 1.

                                      Softness -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this setting unless you need
                                          to comply with a specification  that
                                          requires  a  specific  value. If you
                                          don't have a specification  require-
                                          ment,  we  recommend that you adjust
                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-
                                          ness (sharpness) or  by  enabling  a
                                          noise  reducer filter (noiseReducer-
                                          Filter).  The  Softness   (softness)
                                          setting  specifies  the quantization
                                          matrices that the encoder uses. Keep
                                          the default value, 0, to use the AWS
                                          Elemental default matrices. Choose a
                                          value  from  17 to 128 to use planar
                                          interpolation.   Increasing   values
                                          from  17 to 128 result in increasing
                                          reduction  of  high-frequency  data.
                                          The value 128 results in the softest
                                          video.

                                      SpatialAdaptiveQuantization -> (string)
                                          Keep the default value, Enabled (EN-
                                          ABLED),   to   adjust   quantization
                                          within each frame based  on  spatial
                                          variation   of  content  complexity.
                                          When you enable  this  feature,  the
                                          encoder  uses  fewer  bits  on areas
                                          that  can  sustain  more  distortion
                                          with  no  noticeable visual degrada-
                                          tion and uses  more  bits  on  areas
                                          where  any  small distortion will be
                                          noticeable.  For  example,   complex
                                          textured  blocks  are  encoded  with
                                          fewer  bits  and   smooth   textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.
                                          Note,  though,  that  this   feature
                                          doesn't  take into account where the
                                          viewer's attention is likely to  be.
                                          If viewers are likely to be focusing

                                          uses more bits  on  complex  objects
                                          with  sharp  edges  that move a lot.

                                          that using FrameFormer increases the

                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      InterlaceMode -> (string)
                                          Choose the scan line  type  for  the
                                          output. Keep the default value, Pro-
                                          gressive (PROGRESSIVE) to  create  a
                                          progressive  output,  regardless  of
                                          the scan type of your input. Use Top
                                          field  first  (TOP_FIELD)  or Bottom
                                          field first (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create
                                          an output that's interlaced with the
                                          same field polarity throughout.  Use
                                          Follow,     default     top    (FOL-

                                          bottom (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD) to pro-
                                          duce outputs with the same field po-
                                          larity  as the source. For jobs that
                                          have  multiple  inputs,  the  output
                                          field polarity might change over the
                                          course of the output. Follow  behav-
                                          ior  depends on the input scan type.
                                          If the  source  is  interlaced,  the
                                          output  will  be interlaced with the
                                          same polarity as the source. If  the
                                          source  is  progressive,  the output
                                          will be interlaced  with  top  field
                                          bottom  field  first,  depending  on
                                          which  of  the  Follow  options  you
                                          choose.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional.  Specify  how  the service
                                          determines the  pixel  aspect  ratio
                                          (PAR)  for  this output. The default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE),  uses the PAR from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify  a different PAR in the con-
                                          sole, choose any  value  other  than
                                          Follow  source. To specify a differ-
                                          ent PAR  by  editing  the  JSON  job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When you choose SPECIFIED  for  this
                                          setting,  you must also specify val-
                                          ues for the parNumerator and  parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample,  the value for parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is

                                          If you are using  the  console,  use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame rate for this output.  If  you
                                          want  to keep the same frame rate as
                                          the  input  video,   choose   Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the  dropdown list or choose Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown

                                          Choose the method that you want  Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend  using  drop  duplicate (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions,  such  as  60 fps to 30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions,  you can use interpolate (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE) to  avoid  stutter.  This
                                          results  in  a  smooth  picture, but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts.  For  complex  frame rate
                                          conversions,  especially   if   your
                                          source  video  has already been con-
                                          verted from  its  original  cadence,
                                          use  FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion method  frame  by  frame.  Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding time and incurs  a  sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to specify the denominator  of  this
                                          fraction.  In this example, use 1001
                                          for the value of  FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor.  When  you  use the console for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When  you  use the API for transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify  the  frame  rate as a frac-
                                          tion. For example, 24000  /  1001  =
                                          23.976  fps.  Use FramerateNumerator
                                          to specify  the  numerator  of  this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When   you   use   the  console  for
                                          transcode jobs that use  frame  rate
                                          conversion,  provide  the value as a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          is 29.97. Then Class 145 (CLASS_145)
                                          gives you an output with  a  bitrate
                                          of  approximately 145 Mbps and Class
                                          220 (CLASS_220) gives you and output
                                          with  a bitrate of approximately 220
                                          Mbps. VC3 class also  specifies  the
                                          color bit depth of your output.

                                   Vp8Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value VP8.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target  bitrate  in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Optional. Size of buffer (HRD buffer
                                          model) in bits. For  example,  enter
                                          five megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.  Specify  the  maximum bi-
                                          trate in bits/second.  For  example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          (PAR) for this output.  The  default
                                          behavior,  Follow  source  (INITIAL-
                                          IZE_FROM_SOURCE), uses the PAR  from
                                          your input video for your output. To
                                          specify a different PAR in the  con-
                                          sole,  choose  any  value other than
                                          Follow source. To specify a  differ-
                                          ent  PAR  by  editing  the  JSON job
                                          specification,   choose   SPECIFIED.
                                          When  you  choose SPECIFIED for this
                                          setting, you must also specify  val-
                                          ues  for the parNumerator and parDe-
                                          nominator settings.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP8 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   Vp9Settings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under
                                      (VideoDescription)>(CodecSettings)    to
                                      the value VP9.

                                      Bitrate -> (integer)
                                          Target  bitrate  in bits/second. For
                                          example,  enter  five  megabits  per
                                          second as 5000000.

                                      FramerateControl -> (string)
                                          If  you  are  using the console, use
                                          the Framerate setting to specify the
                                          frame  rate  for this output. If you
                                          want to keep the same frame rate  as
                                          the   input   video,  choose  Follow
                                          source. If you want to do frame rate
                                          conversion, choose a frame rate from
                                          the dropdown list or choose  Custom.
                                          The framerates shown in the dropdown
                                          list are decimal  approximations  of
                                          fractions.  If  you  choose  Custom,
                                          specify your frame rate as  a  frac-
                                          tion.   If  you  are  creating  your
                                          transcoding job specification  as  a
                                          JSON  file  without the console, use
                                          FramerateControl  to  specify  which
                                          value the service uses for the frame
                                          rate for this  output.  Choose  INI-
                                          TIALIZE_FROM_SOURCE  if you want the
                                          service to use the frame  rate  from
                                          the  input.  Choose SPECIFIED if you
                                          want the service to  use  the  frame
                                          rate  you  specify  in  the settings
                                          FramerateNumerator and  FramerateDe-
                                          nominator.

                                      FramerateConversionAlgorithm -> (string)
                                          Choose  the method that you want Me-
                                          diaConvert to use when increasing or
                                          decreasing the frame rate. We recom-
                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      GopSize -> (double)
                                          GOP Length  (keyframe  interval)  in
                                          frames. Must be greater than zero.

                                      HrdBufferSize -> (integer)
                                          Size of buffer (HRD buffer model) in
                                          bits.  For   example,   enter   five
                                          megabits as 5000000.

                                      MaxBitrate -> (integer)
                                          Ignore  this  setting unless you set
                                          qualityTuningLevel  to   MULTI_PASS.
                                          Optional.  Specify  the  maximum bi-
                                          trate in bits/second.  For  example,
                                          enter  five  megabits  per second as
                                          5000000. The default  behavior  uses
                                          twice the target bitrate as the max-
                                          imum bitrate.

                                      ParControl -> (string)
                                          Optional. Specify  how  the  service
                                          determines  the  pixel  aspect ratio
                                          for this output. The default  behav-
                                          ior  is to use the same pixel aspect
                                          ratio as your input video.

                                      ParDenominator -> (integer)
                                          Required when you set  Pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (parControl) to SPECIFIED. On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you specify an output  pixel  aspect
                                          ratio  (PAR)  that is different from
                                          your input video PAR,  provide  your
                                          output  PAR as a ratio. For example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for  parDenominator
                                          is 33.

                                      ParNumerator -> (integer)
                                          Required  when  you set Pixel aspect
                                          ratio (parControl) to SPECIFIED.  On
                                          the console, this corresponds to any
                                          value other than Follow source. When
                                          you  specify  an output pixel aspect
                                          ratio (PAR) that is  different  from
                                          your  input  video PAR, provide your
                                          output PAR as a ratio. For  example,
                                          for D1/DV NTSC widescreen, you would
                                          specify the ratio 40:33. In this ex-
                                          ample, the value for parNumerator is
                                          40.

                                      QualityTuningLevel -> (string)
                                          Optional. Use Quality  tuning  level
                                          (qualityTuningLevel)  to  choose how
                                          you want to trade off encoding speed
                                          for  output  video  quality. The de-
                                          fault  behavior  is  faster,   lower
                                          quality, multi-pass encoding.

                                      RateControlMode -> (string)
                                          With the VP9 codec, you can use only
                                          the variable bitrate (VBR) rate con-
                                          trol mode.

                                   XavcSettings -> (structure)
                                      Required  when  you  set  (Codec)  under

                                          mend using  drop  duplicate  (DUPLI-
                                          CATE_DROP)  for  numerically  simple
                                          conversions, such as 60  fps  to  30
                                          fps. For numerically complex conver-
                                          sions, you can use interpolate  (IN-
                                          TERPOLATE)  to  avoid  stutter. This
                                          results in  a  smooth  picture,  but
                                          might  introduce  undesirable  video
                                          artifacts. For  complex  frame  rate
                                          conversions,   especially   if  your
                                          source video has already  been  con-
                                          verted  from  its  original cadence,
                                          use FrameFormer (FRAMEFORMER) to  do
                                          motion-compensated    interpolation.
                                          FrameFormer chooses the best conver-
                                          sion  method  frame  by  frame. Note
                                          that using FrameFormer increases the
                                          transcoding  time  and incurs a sig-
                                          nificant add-on cost.

                                      FramerateDenominator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode
                                          jobs that use frame rate conversion,
                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps. Use FramerateDenominator
                                          to  specify  the denominator of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use  1001
                                          for  the value of FramerateDenomina-
                                          tor. When you use  the  console  for
                                          transcode  jobs  that use frame rate
                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Frame rate. In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                      FramerateNumerator -> (integer)
                                          When you use the API  for  transcode

                                          specify the frame rate  as  a  frac-
                                          tion.  For  example,  24000 / 1001 =
                                          23.976 fps.  Use  FramerateNumerator
                                          to  specify  the  numerator  of this
                                          fraction. In this example, use 24000
                                          for the value of FramerateNumerator.
                                          When  you  use   the   console   for

                                          conversion, provide the value  as  a
                                          decimal  number  for  Framerate.  In
                                          this example, specify 23.976.

                                          the softness of your output by using
                                          a lower value for the setting Sharp-

                                          frame  based on spatial variation of
                                          content complexity. When you  enable
                                          this feature, the encoder uses fewer
                                          bits on areas that can sustain  more
                                          distortion with no noticeable visual
                                          degradation and uses  more  bits  on
                                          areas  where  any  small  distortion
                                          will  be  noticeable.  For  example,
                                          complex  textured blocks are encoded
                                          with fewer bits and smooth  textured
                                          blocks  are  encoded with more bits.
                                          Enabling this  feature  will  almost
                                          always  improve  your video quality.

                                             ate a progressive output, regard-
                                             less of the scan type of your in-
                                             put.   Use   Top   field    first
                                             (TOP_FIELD) or Bottom field first
                                             (BOTTOM_FIELD) to create an  out-
                                             put  that's  interlaced  with the
                                             same field  polarity  throughout.
                                             Use  Follow,  default  top  (FOL-
                                             LOW_TOP_FIELD) or Follow, default
                                             bottom  (FOLLOW_BOTTOM_FIELD)  to
                                             produce  outputs  with  the  same
                                             field polarity as the source. For
                                             jobs that have  multiple  inputs,
                                             the  output  field polarity might
                                             change over  the  course  of  the
                                             output.  Follow  behavior depends
                                             on the input scan  type.  If  the
                                             source  is interlaced, the output
                                             will be interlaced with the  same
                                             polarity  as  the  source. If the
                                             source is progressive, the output
                                             will be interlaced with top field
                                             bottom field first, depending  on
                                             which  of  the Follow options you
                                             choose.

                                   Applies only to  29.97  fps  outputs.  When
                                   this  feature  is enabled, the service will
                                   use drop-frame timecode on outputs.  If  it
                                   is not possible to use drop-frame timecode,
                                   the    system    will    fall    back    to

                                          coefficients. If your SDR input  has

                                          Speed -> (integer)
                                             The speed of the  filter  (higher

                                   TimecodeBurnin -> (structure)
                                      Settings for burning the output timecode
                                      and specified prefix into the output.

                                      FontSize -> (integer)
                                          Use  Font Size (FontSize) to set the
                                          font size of any burned-in timecode.
                                          Valid values are 10, 16, 32, 48.

                                      Position -> (string)
                                          Use  Position (Position) under under
                                          Timecode burn-in (TimecodeBurnIn) to
                                          specify  the  location the burned-in
                                          timecode on output video.

                                      Prefix -> (string)
                                          Use Prefix (Prefix) to  place  ASCII
                                          characters   before   any  burned-in
                                          timecode. For example, a  prefix  of
                                          "EZ-"  will  result  in the timecode
                                          "EZ-00:00:00:00". Provide either the
                                          characters  themselves  or the ASCII
                                          code  equivalents.   The   supported
                                          range  of characters is 0x20 through
                                          0x7e. This  includes  letters,  num-
                                          bers,  and  all  special  characters
                                          represented on  a  standard  English
                                          keyboard.

                               Width -> (integer)
                                   Use Width (Width) to define the video reso-
                                   lution width, in pixels, for  this  output.
                                   If you don't provide a value here, the ser-
                                   vice will use the input width.

              TimecodeConfig -> (structure)
                 These settings control  how  the  service  handles  timecodes
                 throughout  the  job. These settings don't affect input clip-
                 ping.

                 Anchor -> (string)
                     If you use an editing platform that relies on  an  anchor
                     timecode, use Anchor Timecode (Anchor) to specify a time-
                     code that will match the input video frame to the  output
                     video  frame.  Use  24-hour  format  with  frame  number,
                     (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or  (HH:MM:SS;FF).  This  setting  ignores
                     frame  rate  conversion. System behavior for Anchor Time-
                     code varies depending on your setting for  Source  (Time-
                     codeSource). * If Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Spec-
                     ified Start (SPECIFIEDSTART), the first  input  frame  is
                     the  specified  value  in  Start Timecode (Start). Anchor
                     Timecode (Anchor) and Start  Timecode  (Start)  are  used
                     calculate  output  timecode. * If Source (TimecodeSource)
                     is set to Start at  0  (ZEROBASED)  the  first  frame  is
                     00:00:00:00.  *  If Source (TimecodeSource) is set to Em-
                     bedded (EMBEDDED), the first frame is the timecode  value
                     on the first input frame of the input.

                 Source -> (string)
                     Use Source (TimecodeSource) to set how timecodes are han-
                     dled within this job. To make sure that your  video,  au-
                     dio,  captions,  and  markers  are  synchronized and that
                     time-based features, such as image  inserter,  work  cor-
                     rectly,  choose  the  Timecode source option that matches
                     your assets. All timecodes are in a 24-hour  format  with
                     frame  number  (HH:MM:SS:FF). * Embedded (EMBEDDED) - Use
                     the timecode that is in the input video. If  no  embedded
                     timecode  is in the source, the service will use Start at
                     0 (ZEROBASED) instead. * Start at 0 (ZEROBASED) - Set the
                     timecode of the initial frame to 00:00:00:00. * Specified
                     Start (SPECIFIEDSTART) - Set the timecode of the  initial
                     frame  to a value other than zero. You use Start timecode
                     (Start) to provide this value.

                 Start -> (string)
                     Only use when you set Source (TimecodeSource)  to  Speci-
                     fied  start  (SPECIFIEDSTART). Use Start timecode (Start)
                     to specify  the  timecode  for  the  initial  frame.  Use
                     24-hour   format  with  frame  number,  (HH:MM:SS:FF)  or
                     (HH:MM:SS;FF).

                 TimestampOffset -> (string)
                     Only applies to outputs  that  support  program-date-time
                     stamp.  Use  Timestamp  offset (TimestampOffset) to over-
                     write the timecode date without affecting  the  time  and
                     frame  number.  Provide  the  new date as a string in the
                     format "yyyy-mm-dd". To use Time stamp offset,  you  must
                     also  enable Insert program-date-time (InsertProgramDate-
                     Time) in the output settings. For example,  if  the  date
                     part  of  your  timecodes  is  2002-1-25  and you want to
                     change it to one year later, set Timestamp offset (Times-
                     tampOffset) to 2003-1-25.

              TimedMetadataInsertion -> (structure)
                 Insert  user-defined  custom  ID3 metadata (id3) at timecodes
                 (timecode) that you specify. In each output that you want  to
                 include  this metadata, you must set ID3 metadata (timedMeta-
                 data) to Passthrough (PASSTHROUGH).

                 Id3Insertions -> (list)
                     Id3Insertions contains  the  array  of  Id3Insertion  in-
                     stances.

                     (structure)
                        To insert ID3 tags in your output, specify two values.
                        Use ID3 tag (Id3)  to  specify  the  base  64  encoded
                        string and use Timecode (TimeCode) to specify the time
                        when the tag should be inserted.  To  insert  multiple
                        ID3  tags in your output, create multiple instances of
                        ID3 insertion (Id3Insertion).

                        Id3 -> (string)
                            Use ID3 tag (Id3) to provide a  fully  formed  ID3
                            tag in base64-encode format.

                        Timecode -> (string)
                            Provide  a  Timecode  (TimeCode) in HH:MM:SS:FF or
                            HH:MM:SS;FF format.

          SimulateReservedQueue -> (string)
              Enable this setting when you run a test job to estimate how many
              reserved transcoding slots (RTS) you need. When this is enabled,
              MediaConvert runs your job from an on-demand queue with  similar
              performance  to  what  you  will  see with one RTS in a reserved
              queue. This setting is disabled by default.

          Status -> (string)
              A job's status can be  SUBMITTED,  PROGRESSING,  COMPLETE,  CAN-
              CELED, or ERROR.

          StatusUpdateInterval -> (string)
              Specify  how  often  MediaConvert  sends STATUS_UPDATE events to
              Amazon CloudWatch Events. Set the interval, in seconds,  between
              status  updates.  MediaConvert  sends an update at this interval
              from the time the service begins processing your job to the time
              it completes the transcode or encounters an error.

          Timing -> (structure)
              Information about when jobs are submitted, started, and finished
              is specified in Unix epoch format in seconds.

              FinishTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in Unix epoch format, that the transcoding job fin-
                 ished

              StartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time, in Unix epoch format, that transcoding for the job
                 began.

              SubmitTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time, in Unix epoch format, that you submitted the job.

          UserMetadata -> (map)
              User-defined metadata that you want to associate with an  Media-
              Convert job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)



                                                                     GET-JOB()
