       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-record
          --feature-group-name <value>
          --record-identifier-value-as-string <value>
          [--feature-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --feature-group-name (string)
          The name of the feature group in which you want to put the records.

       --record-identifier-value-as-string (string)
          The  value  that  corresponds  to RecordIdentifier type and uniquely
          identifies the record in the FeatureGroup .

       --feature-names (list)
          List of names of Features to be retrieved.  If  not  specified,  the
          latest value for all the Features are returned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ValueAsString -> (string)
