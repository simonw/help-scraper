SYNOPSIS
            update-sms-channel
          --application-id <value>
          --sms-channel-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --sms-channel-request (structure)
          Specifies the status and settings of the SMS channel for an applica-
          tion.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether to enable the SMS channel for the application.

          SenderId -> (string)
              The identity that you want to  display  on  recipients'  devices
              when they receive messages from the SMS channel.

          ShortCode -> (string)
              The  registered  short  code  that you want to use when you send
              messages through the SMS channel.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,SenderId=string,ShortCode=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "SenderId": "string",
            "ShortCode": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
