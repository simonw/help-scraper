OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --user-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the user.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          Provides information about all the  endpoints  that  are  associated
          with a user ID.

          Item -> (list)
              An  array  of responses, one for each endpoint that's associated
              with the user ID.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about the channel type  and  other  set-
                 tings for an endpoint.

                 Address -> (string)
                     The  destination  address  for messages or push notifica-
                     tions that you send to the endpoint. The  address  varies
                     by channel. For example, the address for a push-notifica-
                     tion channel is typically the token provided  by  a  push
                     notification  service, such as an Apple Push Notification
                     service (APNs) device token or a Firebase Cloud Messaging
                     (FCM) registration token. The address for the SMS channel
                     is a phone number in E.164 format, such as  +12065550100.
                     The address for the email channel is an email address.

                 ApplicationId -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier for the application that's associ-
                     ated with the endpoint.

                 Attributes -> (map)
                     One or more custom attributes that describe the  endpoint
                     by  associating a name with an array of values. For exam-
                     ple, the value of  a  custom  attribute  named  Interests
                     might  be:  ["Science",  "Music",  "Travel"]. You can use
                     these attributes as filter criteria when you create  seg-
                     ments.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)

                 ChannelType -> (string)
                     The channel that's used when sending messages or push no-
                     tifications to the endpoint.

                 CohortId -> (string)
                     A number from 0-99 that represents the  cohort  that  the
                     endpoint  is  assigned to. Endpoints are grouped into co-
                     horts randomly, and each cohort contains approximately  1
                     percent  of the endpoints for an application. Amazon Pin-
                     point assigns cohorts to the holdout or treatment alloca-
                     tions for campaigns.

                 CreationDate -> (string)
                     The  date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint
                     was created.

                 Demographic -> (structure)
                     The demographic information for the endpoint, such as the

                     AppVersion -> (string)
                        The version of the app that's associated with the end-
                        point.

                     Locale -> (string)
                        The locale of the endpoint, in the  following  format:
                        the  ISO 639-1 alpha-2 code, followed by an underscore
                        (_), followed by an ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 value.

                     Make -> (string)
                        The manufacturer of the endpoint device, such as apple
                        or samsung.

                     Model -> (string)
                        The  model name or number of the endpoint device, such

                     ModelVersion -> (string)
                        The model version of the endpoint device.

                     Platform -> (string)
                        The platform of the endpoint device, such as ios.

                     PlatformVersion -> (string)
                        The platform version of the endpoint device.

                     Timezone -> (string)
                        The time zone of the endpoint, specified as a tz data-
                        base name value, such as America/Los_Angeles.

                 EffectiveDate -> (string)
                     The  date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when the endpoint
                     was last updated.

                 EndpointStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether messages or push notifications are sent
                     to  the  endpoint.  Possible values are: ACTIVE, messages
                     are sent to the endpoint; and, INACTIVE,  messages  arent
                     sent to the endpoint.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint  automatically sets this value to ACTIVE
                     when you create an endpoint or update  an  existing  end-
                     point.  Amazon  Pinpoint automatically sets this value to
                     INACTIVE if you update another endpoint that has the same
                     address specified by the Address property.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  unique identifier that you assigned to the endpoint.
                     The identifier should be  a  globally  unique  identifier
                     (GUID) to ensure that it doesn't conflict with other end-
                     point identifiers that are associated with  the  applica-
                     tion.

                 Location -> (structure)
                     The geographic information for the endpoint.

                     City -> (string)
                        The name of the city where the endpoint is located.

                     Country -> (string)
                        The  two-character code, in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format,
                        for the country or region where the  endpoint  is  lo-
                        cated. For example, US for the United States.

                     Latitude -> (double)
                        The  latitude  coordinate  of  the  endpoint location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                     Longitude -> (double)
                        The longitude coordinate  of  the  endpoint  location,
                        rounded to one decimal place.

                     PostalCode -> (string)
                        The postal or ZIP code for the area where the endpoint
                        is located.

                     Region -> (string)
                        The name of the region where the endpoint is  located.
                        For  locations in the United States, this value is the
                        name of a state.

                 Metrics -> (map)
                     One or more custom metrics that your app reports to  Ama-
                     zon Pinpoint for the endpoint.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (double)

                 OptOut -> (string)
                     Specifies whether the user who's associated with the end-
                     point has opted out of receiving messages and push  noti-
                     fications  from  you.  Possible values are: ALL, the user
                     has opted out and doesn't want to receive any messages or
                     push  notifications; and, NONE, the user hasn't opted out
                     and wants to receive all messages and push notifications.

                 RequestId -> (string)
                     The unique identifier for the most recent request to  up-
                     date the endpoint.

                 User -> (structure)
                     One  or more custom user attributes that your app reports
                     to Amazon Pinpoint for the user who's associated with the
                     endpoint.

                     UserAttributes -> (map)
                        One  or  more custom attributes that describe the user
                        by associating a name with an array of values. For ex-
                        ample, the value of an attribute named Interests might
                        be: ["Science", "Music", "Travel"]. You can use  these
                        attributes  as  filter  criteria  when you create seg-
                        ments. Attribute names are case sensitive.

                        An attribute name can contain up to 50 characters.  An
                        attribute value can contain up to 100 characters. When
                        you define the name of a custom attribute, avoid using
                        the  following characters: number sign (#), colon (:),
                        question mark (?), backslash (), and  slash  (/).  The
                        Amazon  Pinpoint console can't display attribute names
                        that  contain  these  characters.   This   restriction
                        doesn't apply to attribute values.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (list)
                            (string)

                     UserId -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the user.
