       Shorthand Syntax:

          BundleId=string,Certificate=string,DefaultAuthenticationMethod=string,Enabled=boolean,PrivateKey=string,TeamId=string,TokenKey=string,TokenKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BundleId": "string",
            "Certificate": "string",
            "DefaultAuthenticationMethod": "string",
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "PrivateKey": "string",
            "TeamId": "string",
            "TokenKey": "string",
            "TokenKeyId": "string"
          }

       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
