NAME
       get-segments -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about  the  configuration, dimension, and other
       settings for all the segments that are associated with an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-segments
          --application-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                          Specifies metric-based criteria  for
                                          including   or  excluding  endpoints
                                          from a segment. These  criteria  de-
                                          rive  from  custom  metrics that you
                                          define for endpoints.

                                          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                             The operator to use when  compar-
                                             ing  metric  values. Valid values
                                             are:   GREATER_THAN,   LESS_THAN,
                                             GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                             LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                             The value to compare.

                                   UserAttributes -> (map)
                                      One or more custom  user  attributes  to
                                      use as criteria for the segment.

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (structure)
                                          Specifies  attribute-based  criteria
                                          for including or excluding endpoints
                                          from a segment.

                                          AttributeType -> (string)
                                             The  type of segment dimension to
                                             use. Valid values are:

                                             o INCLUSIVE - endpoints that have
                                               attributes  matching the values
                                               are included in the segment.

                                               attributes  matching the values
                                               are excluded in the segment.

                                             o CONTAINS - endpoints that  have
                                               attributes'   substrings  match
                                               the values are included in  the
                                               segment.

                                             o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  at-

                                               are included in the segment.

                                          Values -> (list)
                                             The criteria values  to  use  for
                                             the  segment dimension. Depending
                                             on the value of the AttributeType
                                             property,  endpoints are included
                                             or excluded from the  segment  if
                                             their  attribute values match the
                                             criteria values.

                                             (string)

                            SourceSegments -> (list)
                               The base segment to build  the  segment  on.  A
                               base segment, also referred to as a source seg-
                               ment , defines the initial population  of  end-
                               points  for  a segment. When you add dimensions
                               to a segment, Amazon Pinpoint filters the  base
                               segment  by using the dimensions that you spec-
                               ify.

                               You can specify more than one dimensional  seg-
                               ment or only one imported segment. If you spec-
                               ify an imported segment,  the  Amazon  Pinpoint
                               console  displays  a segment size estimate that
                               indicates the  size  of  the  imported  segment
                               without any filters applied to it.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  the  segment identifier and ver-
                                   sion of a segment.

                                   Id -> (string)
                                      The unique identifier for the segment.

                                   Version -> (integer)
                                      The version number of the segment.

                            SourceType -> (string)
                               Specifies how to handle multiple base  segments
                               for  the  segment.  For example, if you specify
                               three base segments for  the  segment,  whether
                               the  resulting segment is based on all, any, or
                               none of the base segments.

                            Type -> (string)
                               Specifies how to handle multiple dimensions for
                               the  segment. For example, if you specify three
                               dimensions for the segment, whether the result-
                               ing  segment includes endpoints that match all,
                               any, or none of the dimensions.

                     Include -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple  segment  groups  for
                        the  segment.  For  example,  if  the segment includes
                        three segment groups, whether  the  resulting  segment
                        includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the
                        segment groups.

                 SegmentType -> (string)
                     The segment type. Valid values are:

                     o DIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment,  which  is  a  segment
                       that  uses  selection  criteria that you specify and is
                       based on endpoint data that's reported by your app. Dy-
                       namic segments can change over time.

                     o IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses
                       selection criteria that you specify  and  is  based  on
                       endpoint  definitions  that you import from a file. Im-
                       ported segments are  static;  they  don't  change  over
                       time.

                 tags -> (map)
                     A string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies
                     the tags that are associated with the segment.  Each  tag
                     consists  of  a  required  tag  key and an associated tag
                     value.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 Version -> (integer)
                     The version number of the segment.

          NextToken -> (string)
              The string to use in a subsequent request to get the  next  page
              of  results in a paginated response. This value is null if there
              are no additional pages.
