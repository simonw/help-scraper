NAME
       update-journey-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels (stops) an active journey.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-journey-state
          --application-id <value>
          --journey-id <value>
          --journey-state-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --journey-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the journey.

       --journey-state-request (structure)
          Changes the status of a journey.

          State -> (string)
              The status of the journey. Currently, Supported values  are  AC-
              TIVE, PAUSED, and CANCELLED

              If  you  cancel  a journey, Amazon Pinpoint continues to perform
              activities that are currently in progress, until  those  activi-
              ties are complete. Amazon Pinpoint also continues to collect and
              aggregate analytics data for those activities,  until  they  are
              complete,  and  any  activities that were complete when you can-
              celled the journey.

              After you cancel a journey, you can't add, change, or remove any
              activities  from the journey. In addition, Amazon Pinpoint stops
              evaluating the journey and doesn't perform any  activities  that
              haven't started.

              When the journey is paused, Amazon Pinpoint continues to perform
              activities that are currently in progress, until  those  activi-
              ties  are  complete.  Endpoints will stop entering journeys when
              the journey is paused and will resume entering the journey after
              the journey is resumed. For wait activities, wait time is paused
              when the journey is  paused.  Currently,  PAUSED  only  supports
              journeys with a segment refresh interval.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          State=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "State": "DRAFT"|"ACTIVE"|"COMPLETED"|"CANCELLED"|"CLOSED"|"PAUSED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JourneyResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status, configuration, and other set-
          tings for a journey.

          Activities -> (map)
              A  map  that  contains a set of Activity objects, one object for
              each activity in the journey. For each Activity object, the  key
              is  the unique identifier (string) for an activity and the value
              is the settings for the activity.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Specifies the configuration and other settings for an  activ-
                 ity in a journey.

                 CUSTOM -> (structure)
                     The  settings for a custom message activity. This type of
                     activity calls an AWS Lambda function or  web  hook  that
                     sends messages to participants.

                     DeliveryUri -> (string)
                        The  destination to send the campaign or treatment to.
                        This value can be one of the following:

                        o The name or Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  an  AWS
                          Lambda  function to invoke to handle delivery of the
                          campaign or treatment.

                        o The URL for a web application or service  that  sup-
                          ports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has
                          to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.

                     EndpointTypes -> (list)
                        The types of endpoints to send the custom message  to.
                        Each  valid  value  maps to a type of channel that you
                        can associate with an endpoint by using  the  Channel-
                        Type property of an endpoint.

                        (string)

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the message data included in a custom chan-
                        nel message that's sent to participants in a journey.

                        Data -> (string)
                            The message content that's passed to an AWS Lambda
                            function or to a web hook.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for the next activity to per-
                        form, after Amazon Pinpoint calls the AWS Lambda func-
                        tion or web hook.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the custom message template to use for the
                        message. If specified, this value must match the  name
                        of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier for the version of the message
                        template to use for the message.  If  specified,  this
                        value  must  match the identifier for an existing tem-
                        plate version. To retrieve a list of versions and ver-
                        sion identifiers for a template, use the Template Ver-
                        sionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint  uses the active version of the template. The
                        active version is typically the version of a  template
                        that's  been  most  recently reviewed and approved for
                        use, depending on your workflow. It isn't  necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 ConditionalSplit -> (structure)
                     The  settings  for  a yes/no split activity. This type of
                     activity sends participants down one of two  paths  in  a
                     journey, based on conditions that you specify.

                     Condition -> (structure)
                        The conditions that define the paths for the activity,
                        and the relationship between the conditions.

                        Conditions -> (list)
                            The conditions to evaluate for the activity.

                            (structure)
                               Specifies a condition to evaluate for an activ-
                               ity in a journey.

                               EventCondition -> (structure)
                                   The dimension settings for the event that's
                                   associated with the activity.

                                   Dimensions -> (structure)
                                      The dimensions for the event  filter  to
                                      use for the activity.

                                      Attributes -> (map)
                                          One  or  more custom attributes that
                                          your application reports  to  Amazon
                                          Pinpoint.  You  can  use  these  at-
                                          tributes as selection criteria  when
                                          you create an event filter.

                                          key -> (string)

                                          value -> (structure)

                                             ria for  including  or  excluding
                                             endpoints from a segment.

                                             AttributeType -> (string)
                                                 The type of segment dimension
                                                 to use. Valid values are:

                                          can be a standard event that  Amazon
                                          Pinpoint    generates,    such    as
                                          _email.delivered.   For   campaigns,
                                          this  can  also  be  a  custom event
                                          that's specific to your application.

                            the activity. For example, if you specify two con-
                            ditions  for an activity, whether both or only one
                            of the conditions must be met for the activity  to
                            be performed.

                        The  amount of time to wait before determining whether
                        the conditions are met, or the date and time when Ama-
                        zon  Pinpoint  determines  whether  the conditions are
                        met.

                        WaitFor -> (string)
                            The amount of time to wait, as a duration  in  ISO
                            8601 format, before determining whether the activ-
                            ity's conditions have been met or moving  partici-
                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                        WaitUntil -> (string)
                            The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when Amazon
                            Pinpoint determines whether the activity's  condi-
                            tions have been met or the activity moves partici-
                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                        The  unique  identifier for the activity to perform if
                        the conditions are met.

                 Description -> (string)
                     The custom description of the activity.

                 EMAIL -> (structure)
                     The settings for an email activity. This type of activity
                     sends an email message to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the  sender  address  for  an email message
                        that's sent to participants in the journey.

                        The  unique  identifier  for the next activity to per-
                        form, after the message is sent.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The name of the email message template to use for  the
                        message.  If specified, this value must match the name
                        of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the  version  of  the  email
                        template  to  use  for the message. If specified, this
                        value must match the identifier for an  existing  tem-
                        plate version. To retrieve a list of versions and ver-
                        sion identifiers for a template, use the Template Ver-
                        sionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint uses the active version of the template.  The
                        active  version is typically the version of a template
                        that's been most recently reviewed  and  approved  for
                        use,  depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 Holdout -> (structure)
                     The settings for a holdout activity. This type of  activ-
                     ity stops a journey for a specified percentage of partic-
                     ipants.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the next  activity  to  per-
                        form, after performing the holdout activity.

                     Percentage -> (integer)
                        The  percentage of participants who shouldn't continue
                        the journey.

                        To determine which participants are held  out,  Amazon
                        Pinpoint  applies a probability-based algorithm to the
                        percentage that you  specify.  Therefore,  the  actual
                        percentage of participants who are held out may not be
                        equal to the percentage that you specify.

                 MultiCondition -> (structure)
                     The settings for a multivariate split activity. This type
                     of  activity  sends  participants  down one of as many as
                     five paths (including a default Else path) in a  journey,
                     based on conditions that you specify.

                     Branches -> (list)
                        The  paths  for the activity, including the conditions
                        for entering each path and the activity to perform for
                        each path.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies  a condition to evaluate for an activity
                            path in a journey.

                            Condition -> (structure)
                               The condition  to  evaluate  for  the  activity
                               path.

                               EventCondition -> (structure)

                                      Attributes -> (map)
                                          One  or  more custom attributes that
                                          your application reports  to  Amazon
                                          Pinpoint.  You  can  use  these  at-
                                          tributes as selection criteria  when
                                          you create an event filter.

                                             ria for  including  or  excluding
                                             endpoints from a segment.

                                             AttributeType -> (string)
                                                 The type of segment dimension
                                                 to use. Valid values are:

                                      key -> (string)

                                      value -> (structure)
                                          Specifies  attribute-based  criteria
                                          for including or excluding endpoints
                                          from a segment.

                                             use. Valid values are:

                                             o INCLUSIVE - endpoints that have
                                               attributes matching the  values
                                               are included in the segment.

                                             o EXCLUSIVE - endpoints that have
                                               attributes matching the  values
                                               are excluded in the segment.

                                             o CONTAINS  - endpoints that have
                                               attributes'  substrings   match

                                             the segment dimension.  Depending
                                             on the value of the AttributeType
                                             property, endpoints are  included
                                             or  excluded  from the segment if
                                             their attribute values match  the
                                             criteria values.

                                             (string)

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The  unique identifier for the next activity to
                               perform, after completing the activity for  the

                     DefaultActivity -> (string)
                        The  unique identifier for the activity to perform for
                        participants who don't  meet  any  of  the  conditions
                        specified for other paths in the activity.

                     EvaluationWaitTime -> (structure)
                        The  amount  of time to wait or the date and time when
                        Amazon Pinpoint determines whether the conditions  are
                        met.

                        WaitFor -> (string)
                            The  amount  of time to wait, as a duration in ISO
                            8601 format, before determining whether the activ-
                            ity's  conditions have been met or moving partici-
                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                        WaitUntil -> (string)
                            The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when Amazon
                            Pinpoint  determines whether the activity's condi-
                            tions have been met or the activity moves partici-
                            pants to the next activity in the journey.

                 PUSH -> (structure)
                     The  settings for a push notification activity. This type
                     of activity sends a push notification to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies the time to live (TTL) value for push  noti-
                        fications that are sent to participants in a journey.

                        TimeToLive -> (string)
                            The  number  of seconds that the push notification
                            service should keep the message, if the service is
                            unable to deliver the notification the first time.
                            This value is converted  to  an  expiration  value
                            when  it's sent to a push-notification service. If
                            this value is 0, the service treats the  notifica-
                            tion  as if it expires immediately and the service
                            doesn't store or try to deliver  the  notification
                            again.

                            This value doesn't apply to messages that are sent
                            through the Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) service.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the next  activity  to  per-
                        form, after the message is sent.

                     TemplateName -> (string)
                        The  name of the push notification template to use for
                        the message. If specified, this value must  match  the
                        name of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The  unique identifier for the version of the push no-
                        tification template to use for the message. If  speci-
                        fied,  this value must match the identifier for an ex-
                        isting template version. To retrieve a  list  of  ver-
                        sions  and version identifiers for a template, use the
                        Template Versionsresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint  uses the active version of the template. The
                        active version is typically the version of a  template
                        that's  been  most  recently reviewed and approved for
                        use, depending on your workflow. It isn't  necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 RandomSplit -> (structure)
                     The  settings  for  a random split activity. This type of
                     activity randomly sends specified percentages of partici-
                     pants  down  one  of  as many as five paths in a journey,
                     based on conditions that you specify.

                     Branches -> (list)
                        The paths for the activity, including  the  percentage
                        of participants to enter each path and the activity to
                        perform for each path.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies the settings for  a  path  in  a  random
                            split activity in a journey.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The  unique identifier for the next activity to
                               perform, after completing the activity for  the
                               path.

                            Percentage -> (integer)
                               The percentage of participants to send down the
                               activity path.

                               To determine which participants are  sent  down
                               each  path, Amazon Pinpoint applies a probabil-
                               ity-based algorithm to the percentages that you
                               specify  for  the  paths. Therefore, the actual
                               percentage of participants who are sent down  a
                               path  may  not  be equal to the percentage that
                               you specify.

                 SMS -> (structure)
                     The settings for an SMS activity. This type  of  activity
                     sends a text message to participants.

                     MessageConfig -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the  sender  ID and message type for an SMS
                        message that's sent to participants in a journey.

                        MessageType -> (string)
                            The SMS message type. Valid  values  are  TRANSAC-
                            TIONAL   (for   messages   that  are  critical  or
                            time-sensitive, such as a one-time passwords)  and
                            PROMOTIONAL (for messsages that aren't critical or
                            time-sensitive, such as marketing messages).

                        OriginationNumber -> (string)
                            The long code to send the SMS message  from.  This
                            value  should  be  one of the dedicated long codes
                            that's assigned to your AWS account.  Although  it
                            isn't  required, we recommend that you specify the
                            long code using an E.164 format to  ensure  prompt
                            and accurate delivery of the message. For example,
                            +12065550100.

                        SenderId -> (string)
                            The sender ID to display as the sender of the mes-
                            sage  on  a recipient's device. Support for sender
                            IDs varies by country or region. For more informa-
                            tion,  see  Supported Countries and Regions in the
                            Amazon Pinpoint User Guide.

                        EntityId -> (string)
                            The entity ID or Principal Entity (PE) id received
                            from  the  regulatory body for sending SMS in your

                        TemplateId -> (string)
                            The template ID received from the regulatory  body
                            for sending SMS in your country.

                     NextActivity -> (string)
                        The  unique  identifier  for the next activity to per-

                        The name of the SMS message template to  use  for  the
                        message.  If specified, this value must match the name
                        of an existing message template.

                     TemplateVersion -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the version of the SMS  tem-
                        plate to use for the message. If specified, this value
                        must match the identifier  for  an  existing  template
                        version.  To  retrieve  a list of versions and version
                        identifiers for a template, use the Template  Version-
                        sresource.

                        If you don't specify a value for this property, Amazon
                        Pinpoint uses the active version of the template.  The
                        active  version is typically the version of a template
                        that's been most recently reviewed  and  approved  for
                        use,  depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily
                        the latest version of a template.

                 Wait -> (structure)
                     The settings for a wait activity. This type  of  activity
                     waits  for  a  certain amount of time or until a specific
                     date and time before moving participants to the next  ac-

                        The amount of time to wait or the date and  time  when
                        the  activity  moves participants to the next activity
                        in the journey.

                        WaitFor -> (string)
                            The amount of time to wait, as a duration  in  ISO
                            8601 format, before determining whether the activ-

              The quiet time settings for the journey. Quiet time  is  a  spe-
              cific time range when a journey doesn't send messages to partic-
              ipants, if all the following conditions are met:

              o The EndpointDemographic.Timezone property of the endpoint  for
                the participant is set to a valid value.

              o The  current time in the participant's time zone is later than
                or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.Start property
                for the journey.

                than or equal to the time specified by the QuietTime.End prop-
                erty for the journey.

              If  any  of  the preceding conditions isn't met, the participant
              will receive messages from the journey, even if  quiet  time  is
              enabled.

              End -> (string)
                 The specific time when quiet time ends. This value has to use
                 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is the hour
                 (with  a  leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the minutes.
                 For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to rep-
                 resent 2:30 PM.

              Start -> (string)
                 The  specific  time when quiet time begins. This value has to
                 use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM format, where HH is  the
                 hour  (with a leading zero, if applicable) and MM is the min-
                 utes. For example, use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM,  or  14:30
                 to represent 2:30 PM.

          RefreshFrequency -> (string)

                                   dimension. Depending on the  value  of  the
                                   AttributeType  property,  endpoints are in-
                                   cluded or  excluded  from  the  segment  if
                                   their  attribute  values match the criteria
                                   values.

                            This can be a standard event that Amazon  Pinpoint
                            generates,  such  as  _email.delivered.  For  cam-
                            paigns, this can also be  a  custom  event  that's
                            specific  to  your  application.  For  information
                            about standard events, see Streaming  Amazon  Pin-
                            point  Events  in  the  Amazon  Pinpoint Developer

                ing  on  the  journey's schedule, the journey may currently be
                running or scheduled to start running at a later  time.  If  a
                journey's  status  is ACTIVE, you can't add, change, or remove
                activities from it.

              o COMPLETED - The journey has been published  and  has  finished
                running. All participants have entered the journey and no par-
                ticipants are waiting to complete the journey or  any  activi-
                ties in the journey.

              o CANCELLED  - The journey has been stopped. If a journey's sta-
                tus is CANCELLED, you can't add, change, or remove  activities
                or segment settings from the journey.

                ning. It may have also  passed  its  scheduled  end  time,  or
                passed its scheduled start time and a refresh frequency hasn't
                been specified for it. If a journey's status  is  CLOSED,  you
                can't add participants to it, and no existing participants can
                enter the journey for the first time.  However,  any  existing
                participants  who  are  currently waiting to start an activity
                may continue the journey.
