                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use when comparing  met-
                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:

                            UserAttributes -> (map)
                               One or more custom user attributes  to  use  as
                               criteria for the segment.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies  attribute-based criteria for in-
                                   cluding or excluding endpoints from a  seg-
                                   ment.

                                   AttributeType -> (string)
                                      The  type  of  segment dimension to use.
                                      Valid values are:

                                      o INCLUSIVE - endpoints  that  have  at-
                                        tributes  matching  the values are in-
                                        cluded in the segment.

                                      o EXCLUSIVE - endpoints  that  have  at-
                                        tributes  matching  the values are ex-
                                        cluded in the segment.

                                      o CONTAINS -  endpoints  that  have  at-
                                        tributes'  substrings match the values
                                        are included in the segment.

                                      o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as  ISO_INSTANT datetimes before
                                        the value are included in the segment.

                                      o AFTER - endpoints with attributes read
                                        as  ISO_INSTANT  datetimes  after  the
                                        value are included in the segment.

                                      o ON - endpoints with attributes read as
                                        ISO_INSTANT dates on the value are in-
                                        cluded in the segment. Time is ignored
                                        in this comparison.

                                      o BETWEEN  -  endpoints  with attributes
                                        read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes  between
                                        the  values  are  included in the seg-
                                        ment.

                                   Values -> (list)
                                      The criteria values to use for the  seg-
                                      ment  dimension.  Depending on the value
                                      of the AttributeType property, endpoints
                                      are  included  or excluded from the seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                     SourceSegments -> (list)
                        The  base segment to build the segment on. A base seg-
                        ment, also referred to as a source segment  ,  defines
                        the  initial  population  of  endpoints for a segment.
                        When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon  Pinpoint
                        filters  the base segment by using the dimensions that
                        you specify.

                        You can specify more than one dimensional  segment  or
                        only  one imported segment. If you specify an imported
                        segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays  a  seg-
                        ment  size estimate that indicates the size of the im-
                        ported segment without any filters applied to it.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies the segment identifier and version of  a
                            segment.

                            Id -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the segment.

                            Version -> (integer)
                               The version number of the segment.

                     SourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the
                        segment. For example, if you specify three  base  seg-
                        ments  for  the segment, whether the resulting segment
                        is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple  dimensions  for  the
                        segment.  For example, if you specify three dimensions
                        for the segment, whether  the  resulting  segment  in-
                        cludes  endpoints  that match all, any, or none of the
                        dimensions.

              Include -> (string)
                 Specifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the  seg-
                 ment.  For  example,  if  the  segment includes three segment
                 groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that
                 match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

          tags -> (map)
              A  string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags
              to associate with the segment. Each tag consists of  a  required
              tag key and an associated tag value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                        cluded in the segment.

                                      o CONTAINS -  endpoints  that  have  at-
                                        tributes'  substrings match the values
                                        are included in the segment.

                                      o BEFORE  -  endpoints  with  attributes
                                        read  as  ISO_INSTANT datetimes before

                                      are  included  or excluded from the seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                     SourceSegments -> (list)
                        The  base segment to build the segment on. A base seg-
                        ment, also referred to as a source segment  ,  defines
                        the  initial  population  of  endpoints for a segment.
                        When you add dimensions to a segment, Amazon  Pinpoint
                        filters  the base segment by using the dimensions that
                        you specify.

                        You can specify more than one dimensional  segment  or
                        only  one imported segment. If you specify an imported
                        segment, the Amazon Pinpoint console displays  a  seg-
                        ment  size estimate that indicates the size of the im-
                        ported segment without any filters applied to it.

                        (structure)
                            Specifies the segment identifier and version of  a
                            segment.

                            Id -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the segment.

                            Version -> (integer)
                               The version number of the segment.

                     SourceType -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple base segments for the
                        segment. For example, if you specify three  base  seg-
                        ments  for  the segment, whether the resulting segment
                        is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.

                     Type -> (string)
                        Specifies how to handle multiple  dimensions  for  the
                        segment.  For example, if you specify three dimensions
                        for the segment, whether  the  resulting  segment  in-
                        cludes  endpoints  that match all, any, or none of the
                        dimensions.

              Include -> (string)
                 Specifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the  seg-
                 ment.  For  example,  if  the  segment includes three segment
                 groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that
                 match all, any, or none of the segment groups.

          SegmentType -> (string)
              The segment type. Valid values are:

              o DIMENSIONAL  - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses
                selection criteria that you specify and is based  on  endpoint
                data  that's reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change
                over time.

              o IMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selec-
                tion  criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint defi-
                nitions that you import from a  file.  Imported  segments  are
                static; they don't change over time.

          tags -> (map)
              A  string-to-string  map  of key-value pairs that identifies the
              tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists  of
              a required tag key and an associated tag value.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Version -> (integer)
              The version number of the segment.
