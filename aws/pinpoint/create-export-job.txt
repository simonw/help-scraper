DESCRIPTION
       Creates an export job for an application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-export-job
          --application-id <value>
          --export-job-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --export-job-request (structure)
          Specifies the settings for a job that exports  endpoint  definitions
          to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access
              Management (IAM) role that authorizes Amazon Pinpoint to  access
              the Amazon S3 location where you want to export endpoint defini-
              tions to.

          S3UrlPrefix -> (string)
              The URL of the location in  an  Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service
              (Amazon S3) bucket where you want to export endpoint definitions
              to. This location is typically a folder that  contains  multiple
              files.   The   URL   should   be   in   the   following  format:
              s3://bucket-name/folder-name/.

          SegmentId -> (string)
              The identifier for the segment to  export  endpoint  definitions
              from.  If  you don't specify this value, Amazon Pinpoint exports
              definitions for all the endpoints that are associated  with  the
              application.

          SegmentVersion -> (integer)
              The  version of the segment to export endpoint definitions from,
              if specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,S3UrlPrefix=string,SegmentId=string,SegmentVersion=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "S3UrlPrefix": "string",
            "SegmentId": "string",
            "SegmentVersion": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportJobResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status and settings of a job that ex-
          ports endpoint definitions to a file. The file can be added directly
          to  an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket by using the
          Amazon Pinpoint API or downloaded directly to a  computer  by  using
          the Amazon Pinpoint console.

              the export job.

          CompletedPieces -> (integer)
              The number of pieces  that  were  processed  successfully  (com-
              pleted) by the export job, as of the time of the request.

          CompletionDate -> (string)
              The date, in ISO 8601 format, when the export job was completed.

          CreationDate -> (string)

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Identity and Access

              S3UrlPrefix -> (string)
                 The URL of the location in an Amazon Simple  Storage  Service
                 (Amazon  S3)  bucket  where the endpoint definitions were ex-

                 The identifier for the segment that the endpoint  definitions
                 were  exported from. If this value isn't present, Amazon Pin-
                 point exported definitions for all the endpoints that are as-
                 sociated with the application.

              SegmentVersion -> (integer)
                 The version of the segment that the endpoint definitions were
                 exported from.

          FailedPieces -> (integer)

              error, such as a syntax error, occurred.

          TotalPieces -> (integer)
              The total number of pieces that must be  processed  to  complete

              job.
