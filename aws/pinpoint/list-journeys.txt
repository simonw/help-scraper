OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the application. This identifier  is  dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --page-size (string)
          The  maximum  number of items to include in each page of a paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --token (string)
          The  NextToken string that specifies which page of results to return
          in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

OUTPUT
       JourneysResponse -> (structure)
          Provides information about the status, configuration, and other set-
          tings for all the journeys that are associated with an application.

          Item -> (list)
              An array of responses, one for each  journey  that's  associated
              with the application.

              (structure)
                 Provides  information  about  the  status, configuration, and
                 other settings for a journey.

                 Activities -> (map)
                     A map that contains a set of Activity objects, one object
                     for  each  activity in the journey. For each Activity ob-
                     ject, the key is the unique identifier  (string)  for  an
                     activity and the value is the settings for the activity.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Specifies  the configuration and other settings for an
                        activity in a journey.

                        CUSTOM -> (structure)
                            The settings for a custom message  activity.  This
                            type  of  activity calls an AWS Lambda function or
                            web hook that sends messages to participants.

                            DeliveryUri -> (string)
                               The destination to send the campaign or  treat-
                               ment  to.  This value can be one of the follow-
                               ing:

                               o The name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  an
                                 AWS  Lambda  function to invoke to handle de-
                                 livery of the campaign or treatment.

                               o The URL for a web application or service that
                                 supports  HTTPS  and can receive the message.
                                 The URL has to be a full URL,  including  the
                                 HTTPS protocol.

                            EndpointTypes -> (list)
                               The  types of endpoints to send the custom mes-
                               sage to. Each valid value maps  to  a  type  of
                               channel that you can associate with an endpoint
                               by using the ChannelType property  of  an  end-
                               point.

                               (string)

                            MessageConfig -> (structure)
                               Specifies the message data included in a custom
                               channel message that's sent to participants  in
                               a journey.

                               Data -> (string)
                                   The message content that's passed to an AWS
                                   Lambda function or to a web hook.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform,  after  Amazon  Pinpoint calls the AWS
                               Lambda function or web hook.

                            TemplateName -> (string)
                               The name of the custom message template to  use
                               for  the message. If specified, this value must
                               match the name of an existing message template.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the  version  of  the
                               message  template  to  use  for the message. If
                               specified, this value must match the identifier
                               for an existing template version. To retrieve a
                               list of versions and version identifiers for  a
                               template, use the Template Versionsresource.

                               If you don't specify a value for this property,
                               Amazon Pinpoint uses the active version of  the
                               template.  The  active version is typically the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed  and  approved  for  use, depending on
                               your workflow. It isn't necessarily the  latest
                               version of a template.

                        ConditionalSplit -> (structure)
                            The  settings  for  a  yes/no split activity. This
                            type of activity sends participants  down  one  of
                            two  paths  in a journey, based on conditions that
                            you specify.

                            Condition -> (structure)
                               The conditions that define the  paths  for  the
                               activity, and the relationship between the con-
                               ditions.

                               Conditions -> (list)
                                   The conditions to evaluate for  the  activ-
                                   ity.

                                   (structure)
                                      Specifies a condition to evaluate for an
                                      activity in a journey.

                                      EventCondition -> (structure)
                                          The dimension settings for the event
                                          that's associated with the activity.

                                          Dimensions -> (structure)
                                             The dimensions for the event fil-
                                             ter to use for the activity.

                                             Attributes -> (map)
                                                 One or more custom attributes
                                                 that your application reports
                                                 to Amazon Pinpoint.  You  can
                                                 use  these  attributes as se-
                                                 lection  criteria  when   you
                                                 create an event filter.

                                                 key -> (string)

                                                 value -> (structure)
                                                    Specifies  attribute-based
                                                    criteria for including  or
                                                    excluding endpoints from a
                                                    segment.

                                                    AttributeType -> (string)
                                                        The  type  of  segment
                                                        dimension    to   use.

                                   ify two conditions for an activity, whether
                                   both or only one of the conditions must  be
                                   met for the activity to be performed.

                            EvaluationWaitTime -> (structure)
                               The  amount  of time to wait before determining

                               time  when  Amazon  Pinpoint determines whether
                               the conditions are met.

                               WaitFor -> (string)
                                   The amount of time to wait, as  a  duration
                                   in  ISO  8601  format,  before  determining
                                   whether the activity's conditions have been
                                   met  or moving participants to the next ac-
                                   tivity in the journey.

                               WaitUntil -> (string)
                                   The date and time, in ISO 8601 format, when

                                   tivity's conditions have been  met  or  the
                                   activity moves participants to the next ac-
                                   tivity in the journey.

                            FalseActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the activity to  per-
                               form if the conditions aren't met.

                            TrueActivity -> (string)
                               The  unique identifier for the activity to per-
                               form if the conditions are met.

                        Description -> (string)
                            The custom description of the activity.

                        EMAIL -> (structure)
                            The settings for an email activity. This  type  of
                            activity sends an email message to participants.

                            MessageConfig -> (structure)
                               Specifies  the sender address for an email mes-
                               sage that's sent to participants in  the  jour-
                               ney.

                               FromAddress -> (string)
                                   The  verified  email  address  to  send the
                                   email message from. The default address  is
                                   the  FromAddress  specified  for  the email
                                   channel for the application.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform, after the message is sent.

                               The  name  of the email message template to use
                               for the message. If specified, this value  must
                               match the name of an existing message template.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)
                               The  unique  identifier  for the version of the
                               email template to use for the message. If spec-
                               ified, this value must match the identifier for
                               an existing template  version.  To  retrieve  a
                               list  of versions and version identifiers for a
                               template, use the Template Versionsresource.

                               If you don't specify a value for this property,
                               Amazon  Pinpoint uses the active version of the
                               template. The active version is  typically  the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed and approved  for  use,  depending  on
                               your  workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest
                               version of a template.

                        Holdout -> (structure)
                            The settings for a holdout activity. This type  of
                            activity  stops a journey for a specified percent-
                            age of participants.

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform, after performing the holdout activity.

                            Percentage -> (integer)
                               The  percentage  of  participants who shouldn't
                               continue the journey.

                               To determine which participants are  held  out,
                               Amazon Pinpoint applies a probability-based al-
                               gorithm to the  percentage  that  you  specify.
                               Therefore,  the  actual  percentage of partici-
                               pants who are held out may not be equal to  the
                               percentage that you specify.

                        MultiCondition -> (structure)
                            The  settings  for  a multivariate split activity.
                            This type of activity sends participants down  one
                            of as many as five paths (including a default Else
                            path) in a journey, based on conditions  that  you
                            specify.

                            Branches -> (list)
                               The  paths for the activity, including the con-
                               ditions for entering each path and the activity
                               to perform for each path.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies  a  condition  to evaluate for an
                                   activity path in a journey.

                                   Condition -> (structure)
                                      The condition to evaluate for the activ-
                                      ity path.

                                      EventCondition -> (structure)
                                          The dimension settings for the event
                                          that's associated with the activity.

                                             Attributes -> (map)
                                                 One or more custom attributes
                                                 that your application reports
                                                 to  Amazon  Pinpoint. You can
                                                 use these attributes  as  se-
                                                 lection   criteria  when  you
                                                 create an event filter.

                                                 key -> (string)

                                                 value -> (structure)
                                                    Specifies  attribute-based
                                                    criteria  for including or
                                                    excluding endpoints from a
                                                    segment.

                                                    AttributeType -> (string)
                                                        The  type  of  segment

                                   sent to  a  push-notification  service.  If
                                   this value is 0, the service treats the no-
                                   tification as if it expires immediately and
                                   the service doesn't store or try to deliver
                                   the notification again.

                                   This value doesn't apply to  messages  that

                            NextActivity -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the next activity  to
                               perform, after the message is sent.

                            TemplateName -> (string)

                               use for the message. If specified,  this  value
                               must match the name of an existing message tem-
                               plate.

                            TemplateVersion -> (string)
                               The unique identifier for the  version  of  the
                               push  notification template to use for the mes-
                               sage. If specified, this value must  match  the
                               identifier for an existing template version. To
                               retrieve a list of versions and version identi-
                               fiers for a template, use the Template Version-

                               If you don't specify a value for this property,
                               Amazon  Pinpoint uses the active version of the
                               template. The active version is  typically  the
                               version of a template that's been most recently
                               reviewed and approved  for  use,  depending  on
                               your  workflow. It isn't necessarily the latest
                               version of a template.

                            The settings for a  random  split  activity.  This
                            type of activity randomly sends specified percent-
                            ages of participants down one of as many  as  five
                            paths  in  a journey, based on conditions that you
                            specify.

                            Branches -> (list)
                               The paths for the activity, including the  per-

                               the activity to perform for each path.

                               (structure)
                                   Specifies the settings for a path in a ran-
                                   dom split activity in a journey.

                                   NextActivity -> (string)
                                      The  unique  identifier for the next ac-
                                      tivity to perform, after completing  the
                                      activity for the path.

                                   Percentage -> (integer)

                                      down the activity path.

                                      To determine which participants are sent
                                      down  each path, Amazon Pinpoint applies
                                      a  probability-based  algorithm  to  the
                                      percentages  that  you  specify  for the
                                      paths. Therefore, the actual  percentage
                                      of participants who are sent down a path
                                      may not be equal to the percentage  that
                                      you specify.

                       Time.End property for the journey.

                     If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, the partic-
                     ipant will receive messages from  the  journey,  even  if

                        and MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30 to  rep-
                        resent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.

                     Start -> (string)
                        The  specific  time when quiet time begins. This value
                        has to use 24-hour notation and be  in  HH:MM  format,
                        where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if applica-
                        ble) and MM is the minutes. For example, use 02:30  to
                        represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to represent 2:30 PM.
