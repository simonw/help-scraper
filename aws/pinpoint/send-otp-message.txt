       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AllowedAttempts": integer,
            "BrandName": "string",
            "Channel": "string",
            "CodeLength": integer,
            "DestinationIdentity": "string",
            "EntityId": "string",
            "Language": "string",
            "OriginationIdentity": "string",
            "ReferenceId": "string",
            "TemplateId": "string",
            "ValidityPeriod": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
