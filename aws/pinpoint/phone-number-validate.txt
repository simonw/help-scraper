SYNOPSIS
            phone-number-validate
          --number-validate-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --number-validate-request (structure)
          Specifies a phone number to validate and retrieve information about.

          IsoCountryCode -> (string)
              The  two-character  code,  in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for the
              country or region where the phone number was  originally  regis-
              tered.

          PhoneNumber -> (string)
              The phone number to retrieve information about. The phone number
              that you provide should include a valid  numeric  country  code.
              Otherwise, the operation might result in an error.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IsoCountryCode=string,PhoneNumber=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "IsoCountryCode": "string",
            "PhoneNumber": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
