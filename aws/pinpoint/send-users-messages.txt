            send-users-messages
          --application-id <value>
          --send-users-message-request <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --send-users-message-request (structure)
          Specifies the configuration and other settings for a message to send
          to all the endpoints that are associated with a list of users.

          Context -> (map)
              A  map of custom attribute-value pairs. For a push notification,
              Amazon Pinpoint adds these attributes to the  data.pinpoint  ob-
              ject  in  the  body of the notification payload. Amazon Pinpoint
              also provides these attributes in the events that  it  generates
              for users-messages deliveries.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          MessageConfiguration -> (structure)
              The settings and content for the default message and any default
              messages that you defined for specific channels.

              ADMMessage -> (structure)
                 The default push notification message for the ADM (Amazon De-
                 vice  Messaging)  channel. This message overrides the default
                 push notification message (DefaultPushNotificationMessage).

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action to occur if the recipient taps the push  noti-
                     fication. Valid values are:

                     o OPEN_APP  - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground
                       app if it was sent to the background. This is  the  de-
                       fault action.

                     o DEEP_LINK  -  Your  app opens and displays a designated
                       user  interface  in  the  app.  This  action  uses  the
                       deep-linking features of the Android platform.

                     o URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's de-
                       vice opens and loads the web page at  a  URL  that  you
                       specify.

                 Body -> (string)
                     The body of the notification message.

                 ConsolidationKey -> (string)
                     An arbitrary string that indicates that multiple messages
                     are logically the same and that Amazon  Device  Messaging
                     (ADM)  can  drop previously enqueued messages in favor of
                     this message.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The JSON data payload to use for the  push  notification,
                     if  the  notification is a silent push notification. This
                     payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object  of
                     the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 ExpiresAfter -> (string)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, that ADM should store the
                     message if the recipient's device is offline. Amazon Pin-
                     point  specifies this value in the expiresAfter parameter
                     when it sends the notification message to ADM.

                 IconReference -> (string)
                     The icon image name of the asset saved in your app.

                 ImageIconUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of the large icon image to display in the content
                     view of the push notification.

                 ImageUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image to display in the push notification.

                 MD5 -> (string)
                     The  base64-encoded,  MD5 checksum of the value specified
                     by the Data property. ADM uses the MD5  value  to  verify
                     the integrity of the data.

                 RawContent -> (string)
                     The  raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for
                     the notification message. If specified, this value  over-
                     rides all other content for the message.

                 SilentPush -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication, which is a push notification that doesn't  dis-
                     play  on  a recipient's device. Silent push notifications
                     can be used for cases such as updating an app's  configu-
                     ration or supporting phone home functionality.

                 SmallImageIconUrl -> (string)
                     The  URL of the small icon image to display in the status
                     bar and the content view of the push notification.

                 Sound -> (string)
                     The sound to play when the recipient  receives  the  push
                     notification.  You  can use the default stream or specify
                     the file name of a sound resource that's bundled in  your
                     app.  On  an Android platform, the sound file must reside
                     in /res/raw/.

                 Substitutions -> (map)
                     The default message variables to use in the  notification
                     message.  You can override the default variables with in-
                     dividual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 Title -> (string)
                     The title to display above the  notification  message  on
                     the recipient's device.

                 Url -> (string)
                     The  URL  to  open  in  the  recipient's  default  mobile
                     browser, if a recipient taps the  push  notification  and
                     the value of the Action property is URL.

              APNSMessage -> (structure)
                 The  default  push  notification  message for the APNs (Apple
                 Push Notification service) channel.  This  message  overrides
                 the  default  push notification message (DefaultPushNotifica-
                 tionMessage).

                 APNSPushType -> (string)
                     The type of push notification to send. Valid values are:

                     o alert - For a standard notification that's displayed on
                       recipients' devices and prompts a recipient to interact
                       with the notification.

                     o background - For a silent  notification  that  delivers
                       content in the background and isn't displayed on recip-
                       ients' devices.

                     o complication - For a notification that contains  update
                       information for an apps complication timeline.

                     o fileprovider  - For a notification that signals changes
                       to a File Provider extension.

                     o mdm - For a notification that tells managed devices  to
                       contact the MDM server.

                     o voip  -  For  a  notification that provides information
                       about an incoming VoIP call.

                     Amazon   Pinpoint   specifies   this   value    in    the
                     apns-push-type request header when it sends the notifica-
                     tion message to APNs. If you don't specify  a  value  for
                     this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value to alert or
                     background automatically, based on  the  value  that  you
                     specify  for the SilentPush or RawContent property of the
                     message.

                     For more information  about  the  apns-push-type  request
                     header,  see Sending Notification Requests to APNs on the
                     Apple Developer website.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action to occur if the recipient taps the push  noti-
                     fication. Valid values are:

                     o OPEN_APP  - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground
                       app if it was sent to the background. This is  the  de-
                       fault action.

                     o DEEP_LINK  -  Your  app opens and displays a designated
                       user interface  in  the  app.  This  setting  uses  the
                       deep-linking features of the iOS platform.

                     o URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's de-
                       vice opens and loads the web page at  a  URL  that  you
                       specify.

                 Badge -> (integer)
                     The  key  that  indicates  whether  and how to modify the
                     badge of your app's icon when the recipient receives  the
                     push notification. If this key isn't included in the dic-
                     tionary, the badge doesn't change. To remove  the  badge,
                     set this value to 0.

                 Body -> (string)
                     The body of the notification message.

                 Category -> (string)
                     The key that indicates the notification type for the push
                     notification. This key is a value that's defined  by  the
                     identifier property of one of your app's registered cate-
                     gories.

                 CollapseId -> (string)
                     An arbitrary identifier that,  if  assigned  to  multiple
                     messages,  APNs uses to coalesce the messages into a sin-
                     gle push notification instead of delivering each  message
                     individually. This value can't exceed 64 bytes.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint  specifies  this  value in the apns-col-
                     lapse-id request header when it  sends  the  notification
                     message to APNs.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The  JSON  payload to use for a silent push notification.
                     This payload is added to the  data.pinpoint.jsonBody  ob-
                     ject of the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 MediaUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image or video to display in the push noti-
                     fication.

                 PreferredAuthenticationMethod -> (string)
                     The authentication method that you want  Amazon  Pinpoint
                     to  use when authenticating with APNs, CERTIFICATE or TO-
                     KEN.

                 Priority -> (string)
                     para>5 - Low priority, the notification might be delayed,
                     delivered as part of a group, or throttled.

                     /listitem> * 10 - High priority, the notification is sent
                     immediately. This is the default value. A  high  priority
                     notification  should  trigger  an alert, play a sound, or
                     badge your app's icon on the recipient's device.  /para>

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority
                     request  header when it sends the notification message to
                     APNs.

                     The equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM),
                     formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5,
                     and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM  value  for  this
                     property,  Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value
                     to the corresponding APNs value.

                 RawContent -> (string)
                     The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload  for
                     the  notification message. If specified, this value over-
                     rides all other content for the message.

                     NOTE:
                        If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notifi-
                        cation,  the  message  payload has to include the con-
                        tent-available key. The value of the content-available
                        key  has  to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If
                        you're sending a standard notification, set the  value
                        of  content-available to 0. If you're sending a silent
                        (background)  notification,  set  the  value  of  con-
                        tent-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification
                        payloads can't include  the  alert,  badge,  or  sound
                        keys.  For  more  information, see Generating a Remote
                        Notification and Pushing Background  Updates  to  Your
                        App on the Apple Developer website.

                 SilentPush -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication. A  silent  (or  background)  push  notification
                     isn't  displayed  on  recipients'  devices.  You  can use
                     silent push notifications to make small updates  to  your
                     app, or to display messages in an in-app message center.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint uses this property to determine the cor-
                     rect value for the apns-push-type request header when  it
                     sends  the notification message to APNs. If you specify a
                     value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the
                     value for the apns-push-type header field to background.

                     NOTE:
                        If you specify the raw content of an APNs push notifi-
                        cation, the message payload has to  include  the  con-
                        tent-available  key. For silent (background) notifica-
                        tions, set the value of content-available to 1.  Addi-
                        tionally,  the  message payload for a silent notifica-
                        tion can't include the alert, badge,  or  sound  keys.
                        For  more information, see Generating a Remote Notifi-
                        cation and Pushing Background Updates to Your  App  on
                        the Apple Developer website.

                        Apple  has  indicated  that they will throttle "exces-
                        sive" background notifications based on current  traf-
                        fic  volumes.  To  prevent  your  notifications  being
                        throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than
                        3  silent  push  notifications  to  each recipient per
                        hour.

                 Sound -> (string)
                     The key for the sound to play when the recipient receives
                     the push notification. The value for this key is the name
                     of a sound file in your app's  main  bundle  or  the  Li-
                     brary/Sounds  folder in your app's data container. If the
                     sound file can't be found or you specify default for  the
                     value, the system plays the default alert sound.

                 Substitutions -> (map)
                     The  default message variables to use in the notification
                     message. You can override these  default  variables  with
                     individual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 ThreadId -> (string)
                     The  key that represents your app-specific identifier for
                     grouping notifications. If  you  provide  a  Notification
                     Content  app  extension,  you can use this value to group
                     your notifications together.

                 TimeToLive -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, that  APNs  should  store
                     and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the ser-
                     vice is unable to  deliver  the  notification  the  first
                     time. If this value is 0, APNs treats the notification as
                     if it expires immediately and the service  doesn't  store
                     or try to deliver the notification again.

                     Amazon  Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-expira-

                     tifications can be used for cases  such  as  updating  an
                     app's  configuration  or delivering messages to an in-app
                     notification center.

                        We recommend using plain text format for email clients
                        that don't render HTML content and  clients  that  are
                        connected to high-latency networks, such as mobile de-
                        vices.

                     The  action to occur if the recipient taps the push noti-
                     fication. Valid values are:

                     o OPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the  foreground
                       app  if  it was sent to the background. This is the de-
                       fault action.

                     o DEEP_LINK - Your app opens and  displays  a  designated
                       user  interface  in  the  app.  This  action  uses  the
                       deep-linking features of the Android platform.

                     o URL - The default mobile browser on the recipient's de-
                       vice  opens  and  loads  the web page at a URL that you
                       specify.

                 CollapseKey -> (string)
                     An arbitrary string that identifies a group  of  messages
                     that  can  be collapsed to ensure that only the last mes-
                     sage is sent when delivery can resume. This  helps  avoid
                     sending  too many instances of the same messages when the
                     recipient's device comes online again or becomes active.

                     Amazon Pinpoint specifies  this  value  in  the  Firebase
                     Cloud  Messaging  (FCM)  collapse_key  parameter  when it
                     sends the notification message to FCM.

                 Data -> (map)
                     The JSON data payload to use for the  push  notification,
                     if  the  notification is a silent push notification. This
                     payload is added to the data.pinpoint.jsonBody object  of
                     the notification.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 IconReference -> (string)
                     The icon image name of the asset saved in your app.

                 ImageIconUrl -> (string)

                     view of the push notification.

                 ImageUrl -> (string)
                     The URL of an image to display in the push notification.

                 Priority -> (string)
                     para>normal - The notification might be delayed. Delivery
                     is optimized for battery usage on the recipient's device.
                     Use this value unless immediate delivery is required.

                     /listitem> * high - The notification is sent  immediately
                     and might wake a sleeping device.  /para>

                     Amazon  Pinpoint specifies this value in the FCM priority
                     parameter when it sends the notification message to FCM.

                     The equivalent values for Apple Push Notification service
                     (APNs)  are 5, for normal, and 10, for high. If you spec-
                     ify an APNs value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint  ac-
                     cepts  and  converts  the  value to the corresponding FCM
                     value.

                 RawContent -> (string)
                     The raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload  for

                     The package name of the  application  where  registration
                     tokens  must  match in order for the recipient to receive

                     Specifies whether the notification is a silent push noti-
                     fication,  which is a push notification that doesn't dis-
                     play on a recipient's device. Silent  push  notifications
                     can  be used for cases such as updating an app's configu-
                     ration or supporting phone home functionality.

                     message. You can override the default variables with  in-
                     dividual address variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                 TimeToLive -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in seconds, that FCM should store and
                     attempt to deliver the push notification, if the  service
                     is  unable to deliver the notification the first time. If
                     you don't specify this value, FCM defaults to the maximum
                     value, which is 2,419,200 seconds (28 days).

                     Amazon   Pinpoint   specifies   this  value  in  the  FCM
                     time_to_live parameter when  it  sends  the  notification
                     message to FCM.

                     the value of the Action property is URL.

              SMSMessage -> (structure)

                     messages  that  are critical or time-sensitive, such as a
                     one-time passwords) and PROMOTIONAL (for  messsages  that
                     aren't critical or time-sensitive, such as marketing mes-
                     sages).

                 OriginationNumber -> (string)
                     The number to send  the  SMS  message  from.  This  value
                     should be one of the dedicated long or short codes that's
                     assigned to your AWS account. If you don't specify a long
                     or short code, Amazon Pinpoint assigns a random long code
                     to the SMS message and sends the message from that code.

                     variables.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

                     The  template  ID  received  from the regulatory body for
                     sending SMS in your country.

              VoiceMessage -> (structure)
                 The default message for the voice channel. This message over-

                     guages  and  the  code for each one, see the Amazon Polly
                     Developer Guide .

                 OriginationNumber -> (string)
                     The long code to send the voice message from. This  value
                     should be one of the dedicated long codes that's assigned
                     to your AWS account. Although it isn't required, we  rec-
                     ommend  that  you  specify the long code in E.164 format,
                     for example +12065550100, to ensure prompt  and  accurate
                     delivery of the message.

                 Substitutions -> (map)
                     The  default  message  variables to use in the voice mes-

                     If  you  don't  specify a value for this property, Amazon
                     Pinpoint uses the active version of the template. The ac-
                     tive  version  is  typically  the  version  of a template
                     that's been most recently reviewed and approved for  use,
                     depending on your workflow. It isn't necessarily the lat-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
