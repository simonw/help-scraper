OPTIONS
       --application-id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the application. This identifier is dis-
          played as the Project ID on the Amazon Pinpoint console.

       --endpoint-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the endpoint.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

                                      of the AttributeType property, endpoints
                                      are included or excluded from  the  seg-
                                      ment if their attribute values match the
                                      criteria values.

                                      (string)

                            EventType -> (structure)
                               The name of the event that causes the  campaign
                               to  be  sent or the journey activity to be per-
                               formed. This can be a standard event that  Ama-
                               zon  Pinpoint  generates, such as _email.deliv-
                               ered. For campaigns, this can also be a  custom
                               event  that's specific to your application. For
                               information   about   standard   events,    see
                               Streaming  Amazon Pinpoint Events in the Amazon

                               DimensionType -> (string)
                                   The type of segment dimension to use. Valid
                                   values are: INCLUSIVE, endpoints that match
                                   the criteria are included in  the  segment;
                                   and,  EXCLUSIVE,  endpoints  that match the
                                   criteria are excluded from the segment.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The criteria values to use for the  segment
                                   dimension.  Depending  on  the value of the
                                   DimensionType property, endpoints  are  in-
                                   cluded  or  excluded  from  the  segment if
                                   their values match the criteria values.

                                   (string)

                            Metrics -> (map)

                               tion  reports  to  Amazon Pinpoint. You can use
                               these metrics as selection  criteria  when  you
                               create an event filter.

                               key -> (string)

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Specifies metric-based criteria for includ-
                                   ing or excluding endpoints from a  segment.
                                   These  criteria  derive from custom metrics
                                   that you define for endpoints.

                                   ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                                      The operator to use when comparing  met-
                                      ric    values.    Valid    values   are:
                                      GREATER_THAN,                 LESS_THAN,
                                      GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
                                      LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL, and EQUAL.

                                   Value -> (double)
                                      The value to compare.

                        FilterType -> (string)
                            The type of event that causes the campaign  to  be
                            sent. Valid values are: SYSTEM, sends the campaign
                            when a system event occurs; and,  ENDPOINT,  sends
                            the  campaign  when  an  endpoint event (Eventsre-
                            source) occurs.

                     QuietTime -> (structure)
                        Time during which the in-app  message  should  not  be
                        shown to the user.

                        End -> (string)
                            The specific time when quiet time ends. This value
                            has to use 24-hour notation and be in  HH:MM  for-
                            mat, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero, if
                            applicable) and MM is the  minutes.  For  example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                        Start -> (string)
                            The specific time when  quiet  time  begins.  This
                            value  has to use 24-hour notation and be in HH:MM
                            format, where HH is the hour (with a leading zero,
                            if applicable) and MM is the minutes. For example,
                            use 02:30 to represent 2:30 AM, or 14:30 to repre-
                            sent 2:30 PM.

                 SessionCap -> (integer)
                     Session  cap which controls the number of times an in-app
                     message can be shown to the endpoint during  an  applica-
                     tion session.

                 TotalCap -> (integer)
                     Total  cap  which  controls the number of times an in-app
                     message can be shown to the endpoint.

                 TreatmentId -> (string)
                     Treatment id of the campaign.
