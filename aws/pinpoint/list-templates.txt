       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-templates
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--prefix <value>]
          [--template-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          The string that specifies which page of results to return in a pagi-
          nated  response.  This  parameter  is not supported for application,
          campaign, and journey metrics.

       --page-size (string)
          The maximum number of items to include in each page of  a  paginated
          response. This parameter is not supported for application, campaign,
          and journey metrics.

       --prefix (string)
          The substring to match in the names of the message templates to  in-
          clude in the results. If you specify this value, Amazon Pinpoint re-
          turns only those templates whose names begin with the value that you
          specify.

       --template-type (string)
          The type of message template to include in the results. Valid values
          are: EMAIL, PUSH, SMS, and VOICE. To include all types of  templates
          in the results, don't include this parameter in your request.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
