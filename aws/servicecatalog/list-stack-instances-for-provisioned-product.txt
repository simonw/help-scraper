OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --provisioned-product-id (string)
          The identifier of the provisioned product.

       --page-token (string)
          The page token for the next set of results. To  retrieve  the  first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       StackInstances -> (list)
          List of stack instances.

          (structure)
              An  CloudFormation  stack,  in  a  specific  account and Region,
              that's part of a stack set operation. A stack instance is a ref-
              erence to an attempted or actual stack in a given account within
              a given Region. A stack instance can exist  without  a  stackfor
              example,  if  the  stack  couldn't be created for some reason. A
              stack instance is associated with only one stack set. Each stack
              instance contains the ID of its associated stack set, as well as
              the ID of the actual stack and the stack status.

              Account -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services account  that  the  stack
                 instance is associated with.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the stack in-
                 stance is associated with.

              StackInstanceStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack instance, in terms  of  its  synchro-
                 nization with its associated stack set.

                 o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances operation has failed
                   and left the stack in an unstable  state.  Stacks  in  this
                   state  are excluded from further UpdateStackSet operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with  RetainStacks  set  to  true,  to delete the stack in-
                   stance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o OUTDATED : The stack isn't currently up to  date  with  the
                   stack set because either the associated stack failed during
                   a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet operation, or the  stack
                   was  part  of  a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet operation
                   that failed or was stopped before the stack was created  or
                   updated.

                 o CURRENT  : The stack is currently up to date with the stack
                   set.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The page token to use to retrieve the next set of results. If  there
          are no additional results, this value is null.
