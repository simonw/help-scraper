LIST-RECORD-HISTORY()                                    LIST-RECORD-HISTORY()



NAME
       list-record-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the specified requests or all performed requests.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-record-history is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: RecordDetails

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --access-level-filter (structure)
          The access level to use to obtain results. The default is User .

          Key -> (string)
              The access level.

              o Account - Filter results based on the account.

              o Role - Filter results based on the federated role of the spec-
                ified user.

              o User - Filter results based on the specified user.

          Value -> (string)
              The  user  to which the access level applies. The only supported
              value is self .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "Account"|"Role"|"User",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --search-filter (structure)
          The search filter to scope the results.

          Key -> (string)
              The filter key.

              o product - Filter results based on the specified product  iden-
                tifier.

              o provisionedproduct  -  Filter results based on the provisioned
                product identifier.

          Value -> (string)
              The filter value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "string",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)
