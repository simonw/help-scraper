NAME
       list-provisioning-artifacts-for-service-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all provisioning artifacts (also known as versions) for the spec-
       ified self-service action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-provisioning-artifacts-for-service-action is  a  paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the results of the following query expressions: ProvisioningArti-
       factViews

SYNOPSIS
            list-provisioning-artifacts-for-service-action
          --service-action-id <value>
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --service-action-id (string)
          The self-service action identifier. For example, act-fs7abcd89wxyz .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ProvisioningArtifactViews -> (list)
          An array of objects with information about product views and  provi-
          sioning artifacts.

              and a provisioning artifact.

              ProductViewSummary -> (structure)
                 Summary information about a product view.

                 Id -> (string)

                     LaunchPaths  is  not  required,  and  the output of  Pro-
                     ductViewSummary can be used directly with  DescribeProvi-
