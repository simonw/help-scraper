PROVISION-PRODUCT()                                        PROVISION-PRODUCT()



NAME
       provision-product -

DESCRIPTION
       Provisions the specified product.

       A  provisioned  product is a resourced instance of a product. For exam-
       ple, provisioning a product based on a CloudFormation template launches
       a  CloudFormation stack and its underlying resources. You can check the
       status of this request using  DescribeRecord .

       If the request contains a tag key with an empty list of  values,  there
       is a tag conflict for that key. Do not include conflicted keys as tags,
       or this causes the error "Parameter validation failed: Missing required
       parameter in Tags[N ]:Value ".

          both.

       --product-name (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --provisioning-preferences (structure)
          An  object  that contains information about the provisioning prefer-
          ences for a stack set.

          StackSetAccounts -> (list)
              One or more AWS accounts where the provisioned product  will  be
              available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The  specified  accounts  should  be within the list of accounts
              from the STACKSET constraint. To get the list of accounts in the
              STACKSET  constraint, use the DescribeProvisioningParameters op-
              eration.

              If no values are specified, the default  value  is  all  acounts
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetRegions -> (list)
              One  or  more  AWS Regions where the provisioned product will be
              available.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              The specified regions should be within the list of regions  from
              the  STACKSET  constraint.  To  get  the  list of regions in the
              STACKSET constraint, use the DescribeProvisioningParameters  op-
              eration.

              If  no  values  are  specified, the default value is all regions
              from the STACKSET constraint.

              (string)

          StackSetFailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per region, for which this operation can
              fail  before AWS Service Catalog stops the operation in that re-
              gion. If the operation is stopped in a region, AWS Service Cata-
              log doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent regions.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You  must specify either StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              The default value is 0 if no value is specified.

          StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per region, for which this stack op-
              eration  can fail before AWS Service Catalog stops the operation
              in that region. If the operation is stopped  in  a  region,  AWS
              Service  Catalog doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent
              regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage,  AWS  Service  Catalog rounds down to the next whole
              number.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  StackSetFailureTolerance-
              Count or StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the  value  of  StackSet-
              FailureToleranceCount  .  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount  is at most
              one more than the StackSetFailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional:  You must specify either StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

          StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, AWS Service Catalog rounds down to  the  next  whole
              number.  This  is true except in cases where rounding down would
              result is zero. In this case, AWS Service Catalog sets the  num-
              ber as 1 instead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Applicable only to a CFN_STACKSET provisioned product type.

              Conditional: You must specify either  StackSetMaxConcurrentCount
              or StackSetMaxConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StackSetAccounts=string,string,StackSetRegions=string,string,StackSetFailureToleranceCount=integer,StackSetFailureTolerancePercentage=integer,StackSetMaxConcurrencyCount=integer,StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

            "StackSetMaxConcurrencyPercentage": integer
          }

       --tags (list)
          One or more tags.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  tag.  A tag is a key-value pair. Tags are
              propagated to the resources created when provisioning a product.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for this key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --notification-arns (list)
          Passed to CloudFormation. The SNS topic ARNs  to  which  to  publish
          stack-related events.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --provision-token (string)
          An  idempotency  token that uniquely identifies the provisioning re-
          quest.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
