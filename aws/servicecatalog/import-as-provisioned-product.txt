IMPORT-AS-PROVISIONED-PRODUCT()                IMPORT-AS-PROVISIONED-PRODUCT()



NAME
       import-as-provisioned-product -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests the import of a resource as a Amazon Web Services Service Cat-
       alog provisioned product that is associated to a  Amazon  Web  Services
       Service  Catalog  product and provisioning artifact. Once imported, all
       supported Amazon Web Services Service Catalog  governance  actions  are
       supported on the provisioned product.

       Resource import only supports CloudFormation stack ARNs. CloudFormation
       StackSets and non-root nested stacks are not supported.

       The CloudFormation stack must have one of the following statuses to  be
       imported:  CREATE_COMPLETE , UPDATE_COMPLETE , UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE
       , IMPORT_COMPLETE , IMPORT_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE .

       Import of the resource requires that the CloudFormation stack  template
       matches the associated Amazon Web Services Service Catalog product pro-
       visioning artifact.

       The user or role that performs this operation must have the cloudforma-
       tion:GetTemplate  and  cloudformation:DescribeStacks IAM policy permis-
       sions.

SYNOPSIS
            import-as-provisioned-product
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --product-id <value>
          --provisioning-artifact-id <value>
          --provisioned-product-name <value>
          --physical-id <value>
          [--idempotency-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --product-id (string)
          The product identifier.

       --provisioning-artifact-id (string)
          The identifier of the provisioning artifact.

       --provisioned-product-name (string)
          The user-friendly name of the provisioned product. The value must be
          unique  for  the Amazon Web Services account. The name cannot be up-
          dated after the product is provisioned.

       --physical-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the resource to be imported. It  only  cur-
          rently supports CloudFormation stack IDs.

       --idempotency-token (string)
          A  unique identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency. If mul-
          tiple requests differ only by the idempotency token,  the  same  re-
          sponse is returned for each repeated request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
