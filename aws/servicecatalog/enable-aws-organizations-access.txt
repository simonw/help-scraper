DESCRIPTION
       Enable  portfolio  sharing  feature through AWS Organizations. This API
       will allow Service Catalog to receive updates on your  organization  in
       order to sync your shares with the current structure. This API can only
       be called by the management account in the organization.

       By calling this API Service Catalog  will  make  a  call  to  organiza-
       tions:EnableAWSServiceAccess  on your behalf so that your shares can be
       in sync with any changes in your AWS Organizations structure.

       Note that a delegated administrator is not  authorized  to  invoke  En-
       ableAWSOrganizationsAccess .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            enable-aws-organizations-access
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
