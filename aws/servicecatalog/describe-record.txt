DESCRIBE-RECORD()                                            DESCRIBE-RECORD()



NAME
       describe-record -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the specified request operation.

       Use  this  operation  after  calling  a request operation (for example,
       ProvisionProduct  ,   TerminateProvisionedProduct  ,  or   UpdateProvi-
       sionedProduct ).

       NOTE:
          If  a  provisioned product was transferred to a new owner using  Up-
          dateProvisionedProductProperties , the new owner will be able to de-
          scribe all past records for that product. The previous owner will no
          longer be able to describe the records, but  will  be  able  to  use
          ListRecordHistory  to see the product's history from when he was the
          owner.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-record
          [--accept-language <value>]
          --id <value>
          [--page-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --id (string)
          The record identifier of the provisioned product. This identifier is
          returned by the request operation.

       --page-token (string)
          The  page  token  for the next set of results. To retrieve the first
          set of results, use null.

       --page-size (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return with this call.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
