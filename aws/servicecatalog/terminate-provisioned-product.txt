SYNOPSIS
            terminate-provisioned-product
          [--provisioned-product-name <value>]
          [--provisioned-product-id <value>]
          [--terminate-token <value>]
          [--ignore-errors | --no-ignore-errors]
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--retain-physical-resources | --no-retain-physical-resources]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provisioned-product-name (string)
          The name of the provisioned product. You cannot specify both  Provi-
          sionedProductName and ProvisionedProductId .

       --provisioned-product-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the provisioned product. You cannot specify both
          ProvisionedProductName and ProvisionedProductId .

       --terminate-token (string)
          An idempotency token that uniquely identifies  the  termination  re-
          quest.  This token is only valid during the termination process. Af-
          ter the provisioned product is terminated,  subsequent  requests  to
          terminate  the  same  provisioned product always return ResourceNot-
          Found .

       --ignore-errors | --no-ignore-errors (boolean)
          If set to true, Service Catalog stops managing the specified  provi-
          sioned product even if it cannot delete the underlying resources.

       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --retain-physical-resources | --no-retain-physical-resources (boolean)
          When  this  boolean  parameter  is  set to true, the TerminateProvi-
          sionedProduct API deletes the Service Catalog  provisioned  product.
          However,  it does not remove the CloudFormation stack, stack set, or
          the underlying resources of the deleted provisioned product. The de-
          fault value is false.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
