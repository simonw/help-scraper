       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-product-as-admin
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--id <value>]
          [--name <value>]
          [--source-portfolio-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --id (string)
          The product identifier.

       --name (string)
          The product name.

       --source-portfolio-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the shared  portfolio  that  the  specified
          product is associated with.

          You can provide this parameter to retrieve the shared TagOptions as-
          sociated with the product. If this  parameter  is  provided  and  if
          TagOptions  sharing  is  enabled in the portfolio share, the API re-
          turns both local and shared TagOptions associated with the  product.
          Otherwise only local TagOptions will be returned.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
