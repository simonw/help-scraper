NAME
       scan-provisioned-products -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the provisioned products that are available (not terminated).

       To use additional filtering, see  SearchProvisionedProducts .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       scan-provisioned-products  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ProvisionedProducts

SYNOPSIS
            scan-provisioned-products
          [--accept-language <value>]
          [--access-level-filter <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-language (string)
          The language code.

          o en - English (default)

          o jp - Japanese

          o zh - Chinese

       --access-level-filter (structure)
          The access level to use to obtain results. The default is User .

          Key -> (string)
              The access level.

              o Account - Filter results based on the account.

              o Role - Filter results based on the federated role of the spec-
                ified user.

              o User - Filter results based on the specified user.

          Value -> (string)
              The  user  to which the access level applies. The only supported
              value is Self .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Key": "Account"|"Role"|"User",
            "Value": "string"
          }

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all available provisioned products

       The  following scan-provisioned-products example lists available provi-
       sioned products.

          aws servicecatalog scan-provisioned-products

          }

OUTPUT
       ProvisionedProducts -> (list)
          Information about the provisioned products.

          (structure)
              Information about a provisioned product.

              Name -> (string)
                 The user-friendly name of the provisioned product.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the provisioned product.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of provisioned product.  The  supported  values  are
                 CFN_STACK and CFN_STACKSET .

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the provisioned product.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of the provisioned product.

                 o AVAILABLE  -  Stable state, ready to perform any operation.
                   The most recent operation succeeded and completed.

                 o UNDER_CHANGE - Transitive state. Operations performed might
                   not have valid results. Wait for an AVAILABLE status before
                   performing operations.

                 o TAINTED - Stable state, ready to perform any operation. The
                   stack  has completed the requested operation but is not ex-
                   actly what was requested. For example, a request to  update
                   to  a  new  version failed and the stack rolled back to the
                   current version.

                 o ERROR - An unexpected error occurred. The provisioned prod-
                   uct  exists  but  the  stack  is  not running. For example,
                   CloudFormation received a  parameter  value  that  was  not
                   valid and could not launch the stack.

                 o PLAN_IN_PROGRESS  -  Transitive  state. The plan operations
                   were performed to provision a new  product,  but  resources
                   have  not yet been created. After reviewing the list of re-
                   sources to be created, execute the plan. Wait for an AVAIL-
                   ABLE status before performing operations.

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 The current status message of the provisioned product.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The UTC time stamp of the creation time.

              IdempotencyToken -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier that you provide to ensure idempotency.
                 If multiple requests differ only by  the  idempotency  token,
                 the same response is returned for each repeated request.

              LastRecordId -> (string)
                 The  record  identifier of the last request performed on this
                 provisioned product.

              LastProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
                 The record identifier of the last request performed  on  this
                 provisioned product of the following types:

                 o ProvisionedProduct

                 o UpdateProvisionedProduct

                 o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

                 o TerminateProvisionedProduct

              LastSuccessfulProvisioningRecordId -> (string)
                 The  record  identifier  of  the last successful request per-
                 formed on this provisioned product of the following types:

                 o ProvisionedProduct

                 o UpdateProvisionedProduct

                 o ExecuteProvisionedProductPlan

                 o TerminateProvisionedProduct

              ProductId -> (string)
                 The product identifier. For example, prod-abcdzk7xy33qa .

              ProvisioningArtifactId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the  provisioning  artifact.  For  example,
                 pa-4abcdjnxjj6ne .

              LaunchRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the launch role associated with the provisioned
                 product.
