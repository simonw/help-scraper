NAME
       stepfunctions -

DESCRIPTION
       AWS Step Functions is a service that lets you coordinate the components
       of distributed applications and microservices using visual workflows.

       You can use Step Functions to build applications from individual compo-
       nents,  each  of which performs a discrete function, or task , allowing
       you to scale and change applications quickly. Step Functions provides a
       console  that  helps  visualize the components of your application as a
       series of steps. Step Functions automatically triggers and tracks  each
       step, and retries steps when there are errors, so your application exe-
       cutes predictably and in the right order  every  time.  Step  Functions
       logs  the state of each step, so you can quickly diagnose and debug any
       issues.

       Step Functions manages operations and underlying infrastructure to  en-
       sure  your  application is available at any scale. You can run tasks on
       AWS, your own servers, or any system that has access to  AWS.  You  can
       access  and  use  Step Functions using the console, the AWS SDKs, or an
       HTTP API. For more information about Step Functions, see the * AWS Step
       Functions Developer Guide * .
