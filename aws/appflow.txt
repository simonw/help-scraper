DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon AppFlow API reference. This guide is for develop-
       ers who need detailed information about the Amazon AppFlow  API  opera-
       tions, data types, and errors.

       Amazon  AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you
       to securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) applica-
       tions  like  Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and Amazon Web
       Services like Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift.

       o Common parameters : Parameters that all Query operations can use.

       o Common errors : Client and server errors that all operations can  re-

       If  you're  new  to  Amazon  AppFlow,  we recommend that you review the
       Amazon AppFlow User Guide .

       Amazon AppFlow API users can use vendor-specific mechanisms for  OAuth,
       and include applicable OAuth attributes (such as auth-code and redirec-
       turi ) with the connector-specific ConnectorProfileProperties when cre-
       ating  a new connector profile using Amazon AppFlow API operations. For
       example, Salesforce users can refer to the ` Authorize Apps with  OAuth
       https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=remoteaccess_authenticate.htm`__
       documentation.
