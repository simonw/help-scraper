GREENGRASSV2()                                                  GREENGRASSV2()



NAME
       greengrassv2 -

DESCRIPTION
       IoT  Greengrass brings local compute, messaging, data management, sync,
       and ML inference capabilities to edge devices. This enables devices  to
       collect and analyze data closer to the source of information, react au-
       tonomously to local events, and communicate securely with each other on
       local networks. Local devices can also communicate securely with Amazon
       Web Services IoT Core and export IoT data to the  Amazon  Web  Services
       Cloud.  IoT  Greengrass  developers can use Lambda functions and compo-
       nents to create and deploy applications to fleets of edge  devices  for
       local operation.

       IoT Greengrass Version 2 provides a new major version of the IoT Green-
       grass Core software, new APIs, and a new console. Use this  API  refer-
       ence to learn how to use the IoT Greengrass V2 API operations to manage
       components, manage deployments, and core devices.

       V2 Developer Guide .
