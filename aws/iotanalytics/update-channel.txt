       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-channel
          --channel-name <value>
          [--channel-storage <value>]
          [--retention-period <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The name of the channel to be updated.

       --channel-storage (structure)
          Where channel data is stored. You can choose one of serviceManagedS3
          or customerManagedS3 storage. If not specified, the default is  ser-
          viceManagedS3 . You can't change this storage option after the chan-
          nel is created.

          serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by  IoT  Ana-
              lytics. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after the data
              store is created.

          customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
              Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  manage.  If
              customer managed storage is selected, the retentionPeriod param-
              eter is ignored. You can't change the choice of S3 storage after
              the data store is created.

              bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket in which channel data is stored.

              keyPrefix -> (string)
                 (Optional)  The prefix used to create the keys of the channel
                 data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has a key  that  is
                 its  unique identifier in the bucket. Each object in a bucket
                 has exactly one key. The prefix must end with a forward slash
                 (/).

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of the role that grants IoT Analytics permission to
                 interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          serviceManagedS3={},customerManagedS3={bucket=string,keyPrefix=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "serviceManagedS3": {

            },
            "customerManagedS3": {
              "bucket": "string",
              "keyPrefix": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --retention-period (structure)
          How long, in days, message data is kept for the channel. The  reten-
          tion  period  can't be updated if the channel's Amazon S3 storage is
          customer-managed.

          unlimited -> (boolean)
              If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

          numberOfDays -> (integer)
              The number of days that message data is kept. The unlimited  pa-
              rameter must be false.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          unlimited=boolean,numberOfDays=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "unlimited": true|false,
            "numberOfDays": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a channel

       The  following  update-channel  example  modifies  the settings for the
       specified channel.

          aws iotanalytics update-channel \
              --cli-input-json file://update-channel.json

       Contents of update-channel.json:

          {
              "channelName": "mychannel",
              "retentionPeriod": {
                  "numberOfDays": 92
              }
          }

       This command produces no output.

       For more information, see UpdateChannel in the AWS  IoT  Analytics  API
       Reference.
