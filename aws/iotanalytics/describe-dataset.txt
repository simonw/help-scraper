DESCRIBE-DATASET()                                          DESCRIBE-DATASET()



NAME
       describe-dataset -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves information about a dataset.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset whose information is retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The name of the dataset.

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the dataset.

          actions -> (list)
              The DatasetAction objects that automatically create the  dataset
              contents.

              (structure)
                 A  DatasetAction  object  that specifies how dataset contents
                 are automatically created.

                 actionName -> (string)
                     The name of the dataset action by which dataset  contents
                     are automatically created.

                 queryAction -> (structure)
                     An SqlQueryDatasetAction object that uses an SQL query to
                     automatically create dataset contents.

                     sqlQuery -> (string)
                        A SQL query string.

                     filters -> (list)
                        Prefilters applied to message data.

                        (structure)
                            Information that is used to filter  message  data,
                            to  segregate  it  according  to  the timeframe in
                            which it arrives.

                            deltaTime -> (structure)
                               Used to limit data to that  which  has  arrived
                               since the last execution of the action.

                               offsetSeconds -> (integer)
                                   The   number   of   seconds   of  estimated
                                   in-flight lag time of  message  data.  When
                                   you  create  dataset contents using message
                                   data from a specified timeframe, some  mes-
                                   sage  data  might  still  be in flight when
                                   processing begins, and so do not arrive  in
                                   time  to  be  processed.  Use this field to
                                   make allowances for the in flight  time  of
                                   your  message  data,  so that data not pro-
                                   cessed from a  previous  timeframe  is  in-
                                   cluded  with the next timeframe. Otherwise,
                                   missed message data would be excluded  from
                                   processing  during  the next timeframe too,
                                   because its timestamp places it within  the
                                   previous timeframe.

                               timeExpression -> (string)
                                   An expression by which the time of the mes-
                                   sage data might be determined. This can  be
                                   the  name of a timestamp field or a SQL ex-
                                   pression that is used to  derive  the  time
                                   the message data was generated.

                 containerAction -> (structure)
                     Information that allows the system to run a containerized
                     application to create the dataset contents. The  applica-
                     tion  must  be  in  a Docker container along with any re-
                     quired support libraries.

                        count.  The  Docker  container contains an application
                        and required support libraries and is used to generate
                        dataset contents.

                        tem to access required resources to run the container-
                        Action  . This includes, at minimum, permission to re-
                        trieve the dataset contents that are the input to  the
                        containerized application.

                            containerAction (min: 1, max: 50).

                     variables -> (list)
                        The values of variables used in the context of the ex-
                        ecution of the containerized  application  (basically,
                        parameters  passed  to the application). Each variable
                        must have a name and a value given by one  of  string-

                            mission to deliver  dataset  contents  to  an  IoT
                            Events input.

                     s3DestinationConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Configuration information for delivery of dataset con-
                        tents to Amazon S3.

                        bucket -> (string)
                            The name of the S3 bucket to  which  dataset  con-

                        key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the dataset contents object in an S3
                            bucket. Each object has a key  that  is  a  unique
                            identifier. Each object has exactly one key.

                            You can create a unique key with the following op-
                            tions:

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:scheduleTime} to  insert  the
                              time of a scheduled SQL query run.

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to insert a unique
                              hash that identifies a dataset content.

                            o Use !{iotanalytics:creationTime} to  insert  the
                              creation time of a dataset content.

                            The  following  example creates a unique key for a
                            CSV file:  dataset/mydataset/!{iotanalytics:sched-
                            uleTime}/!{iotanalytics:versionId}.csv

                            NOTE:
                               If  you  don't use !{iotanalytics:versionId} to
                               specify the key, you might get duplicate  keys.
                               For  example,  you  might have two dataset con-
                               tents with the same scheduleTime but  different
                               versionId  s.  This means that one dataset con-
                               tent overwrites the other.

                        glueConfiguration -> (structure)

                               that  is used to perform the ETL operations. An
                               Glue Data Catalog  table  contains  partitioned
                               data  and descriptions of data sources and tar-
                               gets.

                            databaseName -> (string)

                               alog  in  which  the  table is located. An Glue
                               Data Catalog database contains metadata tables.

                        roleArn -> (string)
                            The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics per-
                            mission  to  interact with your Amazon S3 and Glue
                            resources.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the dataset.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              When the dataset was created.

          lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time the dataset was updated.

          retentionPeriod -> (structure)
              Optional. How long, in  days,  message  data  is  kept  for  the
              dataset.

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, message data is kept indefinitely.

              numberOfDays -> (integer)
                 The  number  of days that message data is kept. The unlimited
                 parameter must be false.

          versioningConfiguration -> (structure)
              Optional. How many versions of dataset contents are kept. If not
              specified  or set to null, only the latest version plus the lat-
              est succeeded version (if they are different) are kept  for  the
              time period specified by the retentionPeriod parameter. For more
              information, see Keeping  Multiple  Versions  of  IoT  Analytics
              datasets in the IoT Analytics User Guide .

              unlimited -> (boolean)
                 If true, unlimited versions of dataset contents are kept.

              maxVersions -> (integer)
                 How many versions of dataset contents are kept. The unlimited
                 parameter must be false .

          lateDataRules -> (list)
              A list of data rules that send notifications to CloudWatch, when
              data  arrives  late. To specify lateDataRules , the dataset must
              use a DeltaTimer filter.

              (structure)
                 A structure that contains the name and configuration informa-
                 tion of a late data rule.

                 ruleName -> (string)
                     The name of the late data rule.

                 ruleConfiguration -> (structure)
                     The information needed to configure the late data rule.

                     deltaTimeSessionWindowConfiguration -> (structure)
                        The  information needed to configure a delta time ses-
                        sion window.

                        timeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                            A time interval. You can use  timeoutInMinutes  so
                            that  IoT Analytics can batch up late data notifi-
                            cations that have been generated  since  the  last
                            execution.  IoT Analytics sends one batch of noti-
                            fications to Amazon CloudWatch Events at one time.
