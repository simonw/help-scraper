LIST-DATASTORES()                                            LIST-DATASTORES()



NAME
       list-datastores -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of data stores.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-datastores is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: datastoreSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-datastores
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              A summary of information about a data store.

              datastoreName -> (string)
                 The name of the data store.

              datastoreStorage -> (structure)
                 Where data in a data store is stored.

                 serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store data in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by  IoT
                     Analytics.

                 customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used  to store data in an Amazon S3 bucket managed by IoT
                     Analytics.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where  your  data  is

                        data store data objects. Each object in an  Amazon  S3
                        bucket  has a key that is its unique identifier in the
                        bucket. Each object in a bucket has exactly  one  key.
                        The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                     customerManagedS3Storage -> (structure)
                        Used  to  store data used by IoT SiteWise in an Amazon
                        S3 bucket that you manage.

                        bucket -> (string)
                            The name of the Amazon S3 bucket where  your  data
                            is stored.

                        keyPrefix -> (string)
                            (Optional)  The  prefix used to create the keys of
                            the data store data objects.  Each  object  in  an
                            Amazon  S3  bucket  has  a  key that is its unique
                            identifier in the bucket. Each object in a  bucket
                            has  exactly  one  key. The prefix must end with a
                            forward slash (/).

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the data store.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the data store was created.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the data store was updated.

              lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time when a new message arrived in the data store.

                 IoT Analytics updates this value at most once per minute  for
                 Amazon  Simple  Storage  Service  one  data store. Hence, the
                 lastMessageArrivalTime value is an approximation.

                 This feature only applies to messages  that  arrived  in  the
                 data store after October 23, 2020.

              fileFormatType -> (string)

                 Contains information about the partition dimensions in a data
                 store.

                 partitions -> (list)

                               a  timestamp.  The  default  format  is seconds
                               since epoch (January 1, 1970  at  midnight  UTC
                               time).
