PUT-LOGGING-OPTIONS()                                    PUT-LOGGING-OPTIONS()



NAME
       put-logging-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets or updates the IoT Analytics logging options.

       If you update the value of any loggingOptions field, it takes up to one
       minute for the change to take effect. Also, if you  change  the  policy
       attached  to  the role you specified in the roleArn field (for example,
       to correct an invalid policy), it takes up to  five  minutes  for  that
       change to take effect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-logging-options
          --logging-options <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --logging-options (structure)
          The new values of the IoT Analytics logging options.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of the role that grants permission to IoT Analytics to
              perform logging.

          level -> (string)
              The logging level. Currently, only ERROR is supported.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              If true, logging is enabled for IoT Analytics.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,level=string,enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "level": "ERROR",
            "enabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set or update logging options

       The following put-logging-options example sets or updates the  AWS  IoT
       Analytics  logging  options.  If you update the value of any loggingOp-
       tions field, it can take up to one minute for the change  to  take  ef-
       fect. Also, if you change the policy attached to the role you specified
       in the "roleArn" field (for example, to correct an invalid  policy)  it
       can take up to five minutes for that change to take effect.
