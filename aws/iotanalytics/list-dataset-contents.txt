LIST-DATASET-CONTENTS()                                LIST-DATASET-CONTENTS()



NAME
       list-dataset-contents -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists information about dataset contents that have been created.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-dataset-contents  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: datasetContentSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-dataset-contents
          --dataset-name <value>
          [--scheduled-on-or-after <value>]
          [--scheduled-before <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-name (string)
          The name of the dataset whose contents information you want to list.

       --scheduled-on-or-after (timestamp)
          A filter to limit results to those dataset contents  whose  creation
          is  scheduled  on  or  after  the  given  time.  See the field trig-
          gers.schedule in the CreateDataset request. (timestamp)

       --scheduled-before (timestamp)
          A filter to limit results to those dataset contents  whose  creation
          is  scheduled before the given time. See the field triggers.schedule
          in the CreateDataset request. (timestamp)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list information about dataset contents

       The following list-dataset-contents  example  lists  information  about
       dataset contents that have been created.

          aws iotanalytics list-dataset-contents \
              --dataset-name mydataset

       Output:

          {
              "datasetContentSummaries": [
                  {
                      "status": {
                          "state": "SUCCEEDED"
                      },
                      "scheduleTime": 1557863215.995,
                      "version": "b10ea2a9-66c1-4d99-8d1f-518113b738d0",
                      "creationTime": 1557863215.995
                  }
              ]
          }
