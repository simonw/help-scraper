LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of channels.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-channels  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: channelSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To retrieve a list of channels

       The  following  list-channels  example displays summary information for
       the available channels.

          aws iotanalytics list-channels

       Output:

          {
              "channelSummaries": [
                  {
                      "status": "ACTIVE",
                      "channelName": "mychannel",
                      "creationTime": 1557860351.001,
                      "lastUpdateTime": 1557860351.001
                  }
              ]
          }

       Reference.

OUTPUT
       channelSummaries -> (list)
          A list of ChannelSummary objects.

          (structure)
              A summary of information about a channel.

              channelName -> (string)
                 The name of the channel.

              channelStorage -> (structure)
                 Where channel data is stored.

                 serviceManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket managed by IoT
                     Analytics.

                 customerManagedS3 -> (structure)
                     Used to store channel data in an S3 bucket that you  man-
                     age.

                     bucket -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  S3 bucket in which channel data is
                        stored.

                     keyPrefix -> (string)
                        (Optional) The prefix used to create the keys  of  the
                        channel  data objects. Each object in an S3 bucket has
                        a key that is its unique identifier within the  bucket
                        (each  object  in  a  bucket has exactly one key). The
                        prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

                     roleArn -> (string)
                        The ARN of the role that grants IoT Analytics  permis-
                        sion to interact with your Amazon S3 resources.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the channel.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 When the channel was created.

              lastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time the channel was updated.

              lastMessageArrivalTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time when a new message arrived in the channel.

                 IoT  Analytics updates this value at most once per minute for
                 one channel. Hence, the lastMessageArrivalTime  value  is  an
                 approximation.

                 This  feature  only  applies  to messages that arrived in the
                 data store after October 23, 2020.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results, or null if there  are
          no more results.
