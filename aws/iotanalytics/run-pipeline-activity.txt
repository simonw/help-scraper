SYNOPSIS
            run-pipeline-activity
          --pipeline-activity <value>
          --payloads <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-activity (structure)
          The pipeline activity that is run. This must not be a channel activ-
          ity  or a data store activity because these activities are used in a
          pipeline only to load the original message and to store the  (possi-
          bly)  transformed  message.  If a Lambda activity is specified, only
          short-running Lambda functions (those with a timeout of less than 30
          seconds or less) can be used.

          channel -> (structure)
              Determines the source of the messages to be processed.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the channel activity.

              channelName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  channel  from which the messages are pro-
                 cessed.

              next -> (string)
                 The next activity in the pipeline.

          lambda -> (structure)
              Runs a Lambda function to modify the message.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the lambda activity.

              lambdaName -> (string)
                 The name of the Lambda function that is run on the message.

              batchSize -> (integer)
                 The number of messages passed to the Lambda function for pro-
                 cessing.

                 The Lambda function must be able to process all of these mes-
                 sages within five minutes, which is the maximum timeout dura-
                 tion for Lambda functions.

              next -> (string)
                 The next activity in the pipeline.

          datastore -> (structure)
              Specifies where to store the processed message data.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the datastore activity.

              datastoreName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  data  store  where processed messages are
                 stored.

          addAttributes -> (structure)
              Adds other attributes based on existing attributes in  the  mes-
              sage.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the addAttributes activity.

              attributes -> (map)
                 A  list  of 1-50 AttributeNameMapping objects that map an ex-
                 isting attribute to a new attribute.

                 NOTE:
                     The existing attributes remain in the message, so if  you
                     want to remove the originals, use RemoveAttributeActivity
                     .

              Used to create a new message using only the specified attributes
              from the original message.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the selectAttributes activity.

              attributes -> (list)

                 The name of the math activity.

              attribute -> (string)
                 The name of the attribute that contains  the  result  of  the
                 math operation.

              math -> (string)

       --payloads (list)

          (blob)

       Syntax:

          blob blob ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       payloads -> (list)
          The enriched or transformed sample message  payloads  as  base64-en-
          coded strings. (The results of running the pipeline activity on each
