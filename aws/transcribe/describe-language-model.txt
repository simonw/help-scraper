DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()                            DESCRIBE-LANGUAGE-MODEL()



NAME
       describe-language-model -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information about a single custom language model. Use this infor-
       mation to see details about the language model in your Amazon Web  Ser-
       vices account. You can also see whether the base language model used to
       create your custom language model has been  updated.  If  Amazon  Tran-
       scribe has updated the base model, you can create a new custom language
       model using the updated base model. If the language model  wasn't  cre-
       ated,  you  can  use this operation to understand why Amazon Transcribe
       couldn't create it.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-language-model
          --model-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --model-name (string)
          The name of the custom language model you submit to get more  infor-
          mation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific custom language model

       The following describe-language-model example gets information about  a
       specific  custom  language  model. For example, under BaseModelName you
       can see whether your model is trained using a  NarrowBand  or  WideBand
       model.  Custom  language  models with a NarrowBand base model can tran-
       scribe audio with a sample rate less than 16 kHz. Language models using
       a  WideBand  base model can transcribe audio with a sample rate greater
       than 16 kHz. The S3Uri parameter indicates the Amazon S3 prefix  you've
       used to access the training data to create the custom language model.

          aws transcribe describe-language-model \
              --model-name cli-clm-example

       Output:

          {
              "LanguageModel": {
                  "ModelName": "cli-clm-example",
                  "CreateTime": "2020-09-25T17:57:38.504000+00:00",

                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       LanguageModel -> (structure)
          The name of the custom language model you requested more information
          about.

          ModelName -> (string)
              The name of the custom language model.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              The time the custom language model was created.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The most recent time the custom language model was modified.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code you used to create your custom language model.

          BaseModelName -> (string)
              The Amazon Transcribe standard language  model,  or  base  model
              used to create the custom language model.

          ModelStatus -> (string)
              The  creation status of a custom language model. When the status
              is COMPLETED the model is ready for use.

          UpgradeAvailability -> (boolean)
              Whether the base model used for the custom language model is  up
              to  date.  If  this  field is true then you are running the most
              up-to-date version of the base model  in  your  custom  language
              model.

          FailureReason -> (string)

          InputDataConfig -> (structure)

              S3Uri -> (string)

                 files that you use to train your custom language model.

              TuningDataS3Uri -> (string)
