NAME
       list-transcription-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists transcription jobs with the specified status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-transcription-jobs
          [--status <value>]
          [--job-name-contains <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          When  specified,  returns only transcription jobs with the specified
          status. Jobs are ordered by creation date, with the newest jobs  re-
          turned  first.  If  you dont specify a status, Amazon Transcribe re-
          turns all transcription jobs ordered by creation date.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o FAILED

          o COMPLETED

       --job-name-contains (string)
          When specified, the jobs returned in the list are  limited  to  jobs
          whose name contains the specified string.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  result  of the previous request to ListTranscriptionJobs is
          truncated, include the NextToken to fetch the next set of jobs.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of jobs to return in each  page  of  results.  If
          there  are fewer results than the value you specify, only the actual
          results are returned. If you do not specify a value, the default  of
          5 is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Status -> (string)
          The requested status of the jobs returned.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The ListTranscriptionJobs operation returns a  page  of  jobs  at  a
          time.  The maximum size of the page is set by the MaxResults parame-
          ter. If there are more jobs in the list than the page  size,  Amazon
          Transcribe returns the NextPage token. Include the token in the next
          request to the ListTranscriptionJobs operation to return in the next
          page of jobs.

       TranscriptionJobSummaries -> (list)
          A list of objects containing summary information for a transcription
          job.

          (structure)
              Provides a summary of information about a transcription job.

              TranscriptionJobName -> (string)
                 The name of the transcription job.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

              StartTime -> (timestamp)

              LanguageCode -> (string)
                 The language code for the input speech.

              TranscriptionJobStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the transcription job. When the status is  COM-
                 PLETED , use the GetTranscriptionJob operation to get the re-
                 sults of the transcription.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 If the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , a description
                 of the error.

              OutputLocationType -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  location  of  the output of the transcription
                 job.

                 bucket specified in the outputBucketName field when the tran-
                 scription job was started with the StartTranscriptionJob  op-
                 eration.

                 If  the  value is SERVICE_BUCKET then the output is stored by
                 Amazon Transcribe and can be retrieved using the URI  in  the
                 GetTranscriptionJob response's TranscriptFileUri field.

              ContentRedaction -> (structure)
                 The content redaction settings of the transcription job.

                 RedactionType -> (string)
                     Request   parameter  that  defines  the  entities  to  be
                     redacted. The only accepted value is PII .

                 RedactionOutput -> (string)

                     the redacted transcript.

                     When you choose redacted_and_unredacted Amazon Transcribe
                     outputs both the redacted and unredacted transcripts.

                 PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                     The  types  of  personally identifiable information (PII)
                     you want to redact in your transcript.

                     (string)

              ModelSettings -> (structure)
                 The object used to call your custom language  model  to  your
                 transcription job.

                 LanguageModelName -> (string)
                     The name of your custom language model.

              IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)

                 transcription job.

              IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
                 A value between zero and one that Amazon Transcribe  assigned
                 to  the  language it identified in the source audio. A higher
                 score indicates that Amazon Transcribe is more  confident  in
                 the language it identified.
