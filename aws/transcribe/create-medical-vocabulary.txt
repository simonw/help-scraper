SYNOPSIS
            create-medical-vocabulary
          --vocabulary-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          --vocabulary-file-uri <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-name (string)
          The name of the custom vocabulary. This case-sensitive name must  be
          unique within an Amazon Web Services account. If you try to create a
          vocabulary with the same name as a previous vocabulary,  you  get  a
          ConflictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The language code for the language used for the entries in your cus-
          tom vocabulary. The language code of  your  custom  vocabulary  must
          match  the  language  code  of  your  transcription  job. US English
          (en-US) is the only language code available  for  Amazon  Transcribe
          Medical.

       --vocabulary-file-uri (string)
          The  location  in  Amazon S3 of the text file you use to define your
          custom vocabulary. The URI must be in the same Amazon  Web  Services
          Region  as the resource that you're calling. Enter information about
          your VocabularyFileUri in the following format:
              https://s3.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>/<keypre-
              fix>/<objectkey>

          The following is an example URI for a vocabulary file that is stored
          in Amazon S3:
              https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vo-
              cab.txt

          For  more  information about Amazon S3 object names, see Object Keys
          in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

          For more information about custom vocabularies, see  Medical  Custom
          Vocabularies .

       --tags (list)
          Adds  one  or  more tags, each in the form of a key:value pair, to a
          new medical vocabulary at the time you create this new vocabulary.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe.  For  example, a tag with the key:value pair Depart-
              ment:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its  use  by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a medical custom vocabulary

       The following create-medical-vocabulary example creates a custom vocab-
       ulary. To create a custom vocabulary, you must have created a text file
       with all the terms that you want to transcribe more accurately. For vo-
       cabulary-file-uri,  specify  the  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3) URI of that text file. For language-code, specify a  language  code
       corresponding  to  the  language of your custom vocabulary. For vocabu-
       lary-name, specify what you want to call your custom vocabulary.

          aws transcribe create-medical-vocabulary \
              --vocabulary-name cli-medical-vocab-example \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-file-uri https://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET.AWS-Region.amazonaws.com/the-text-file-for-the-medical-custom-vocabulary.txt

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyName": "cli-medical-vocab-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code",
              "VocabularyState": "PENDING"
          }

       For more information, see Medical Custom  Vocabularies  in  the  Amazon
       Transcribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyName -> (string)
          The name of the vocabulary. The name must be unique within an Amazon
          Web Services account and is case sensitive.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code for the entries in your custom vocabulary. US Eng-
          lish  (en-US)  is the only valid language code for Amazon Transcribe
          Medical.

       VocabularyState -> (string)
          The processing state of your custom vocabulary in Amazon  Transcribe
          Medical.  If  the  state  is READY , you can use the vocabulary in a
          StartMedicalTranscriptionJob request.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that you created the vocabulary.

       FailureReason -> (string)
          If the VocabularyState field is FAILED , this field contains  infor-
          mation about why the job failed.
