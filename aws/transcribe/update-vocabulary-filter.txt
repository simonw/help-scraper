SYNOPSIS
            update-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          [--words <value>]
          [--vocabulary-filter-file-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The  name of the vocabulary filter to update. If you try to update a
          vocabulary filter with the same name as another  vocabulary  filter,
          you get a ConflictException error.

       --words (list)
          The  words to use in the vocabulary filter. Only use characters from
          the character set defined for custom vocabularies.  For  a  list  of
          character sets, see Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          If you provide a list of words in the Words parameter, you can't use
          the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The Amazon S3 location of a text file used as input  to  create  the
          vocabulary  filter.  Only  use characters from the character set de-
          fined for custom vocabularies. For a list  of  character  sets,  see
          Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          The specified file must be less than 50 KB of UTF-8 characters.

          If you provide the location of a list of words in the VocabularyFil-
          terFileUri parameter, you can't use the Words parameter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              --vocabulary-filter-name vocabulary-filter-name
