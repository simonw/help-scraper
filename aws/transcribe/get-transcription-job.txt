GET-TRANSCRIPTION-JOB()                                GET-TRANSCRIPTION-JOB()



NAME
       get-transcription-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a transcription job. To see the status of the
       job, check the TranscriptionJobStatus field. If the status is COMPLETED
       ,  the  job  is  finished  and you can find the results at the location
       specified in the TranscriptFileUri field. If you enable content  redac-
       tion, the redacted transcript appears in RedactedTranscriptFileUri .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-transcription-job
          --transcription-job-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transcription-job-name (string)
          The name of the job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a specific transcription job

       The following get-transcription-job example gets  information  about  a
       specific  transcription  job.  To access the transcription results, use
       the TranscriptFileUri parameter. Use the MediaFileUri parameter to  see
       which  audio  file  you transcribed with this job. You can use the Set-
       tings object to see the optional features you've enabled in  the  tran-
       scription job.

              The status of the transcription job.

          LanguageCode -> (string)
              The language code for the input speech.

          MediaSampleRateHertz -> (integer)
              The sample rate, in Hertz (Hz), of the audio track in the  input
              media file.

          MediaFormat -> (string)
              The format of the input media file.

          Media -> (structure)
              An  object  that describes the input media for the transcription
              job.

              MediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the input media file. The URI  must
                 be  in the same region as the API endpoint that you are call-
                 ing. The general form is:
                     s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/keyprefix/objectkey

                 For example:
                     s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/example.flac

                     s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/mediafiles/example.flac

                 For more information about S3 object names, see  Object  Keys
                 in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .

              RedactedMediaFileUri -> (string)
                 The  S3  object location for your redacted output media file.
                 This is only supported for call analytics jobs.

              An object that describes the output of the transcription job.

              TranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the transcript. If you specified an S3
                 bucket  in  the  OutputBucketName  field when you created the
                 job, this is the URI of that bucket. If you  chose  to  store
                 the  transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is a shareable URL
                 that provides secure access to that location.

              RedactedTranscriptFileUri -> (string)
                 The S3 object location of the redacted transcript.

                 Use this URI to access the redacted transcript. If you speci-
                 fied an S3 bucket in the OutputBucketName field when you cre-
                 ated the job, this is the URI of that bucket. If you chose to
                 store  the  transcript in Amazon Transcribe, this is a share-
                 able URL that provides secure access to that location.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job started processing.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job was created.

          CompletionTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the job completed.

          FailureReason -> (string)
              If the TranscriptionJobStatus field is FAILED , this field  con-
              tains information about why the job failed.

              The FailureReason field can contain one of the following values:

              o Unsupported  media  format - The media format specified in the
                MediaFormat field of the request isn't valid. See the descrip-
                tion of the MediaFormat field for a list of valid values.

              o The  media  format  provided does not match the detected media
                format - The media format of the audio file doesn't match  the
                format  specified  in  the  MediaFormat  field in the request.
                Check the media format of your media file and make  sure  that
                the two values match.

              o Invalid sample rate for audio file - The sample rate specified
                in the MediaSampleRateHertz of the request  isn't  valid.  The
                sample rate must be between 8,000 and 48,000 Hertz.

              o The  sample  rate  provided does not match the detected sample
                rate - The sample rate in the audio  file  doesn't  match  the
                sample rate specified in the MediaSampleRateHertz field in the
                request. Check the sample rate of your  media  file  and  make
                sure that the two values match.

              o Invalid  file size: file size too large - The size of your au-
                dio file is larger than Amazon  Transcribe  can  process.  For
                more  information,  see Limits in the Amazon Transcribe Devel-
                oper Guide .

              o Invalid number of channels: number of  channels  too  large  -
                Your  audio  contains  more channels than Amazon Transcribe is
                configured to process. To  request  additional  channels,  see
                Amazon  Transcribe  Limits  in the Amazon Web Services General
                Reference .

          Settings -> (structure)
              Optional settings for the transcription job. Use these  settings
              to  turn  on  speaker  recognition, to set the maximum number of
              speakers that should be identified and to specify a  custom  vo-
              cabulary to use when processing the transcription job.

              VocabularyName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  a  vocabulary to use when processing the tran-
                 scription job.

              ShowSpeakerLabels -> (boolean)
                 Determines whether the transcription job uses speaker  recog-
                 nition  to  identify  different  speakers in the input audio.
                 Speaker recognition labels individual speakers in  the  audio
                 file.  If  you  set  the ShowSpeakerLabels field to true, you
                 must also set the maximum number of speaker labels  MaxSpeak-
                 erLabels field.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request. If you set both, your  request  re-
                 turns a BadRequestException .

              MaxSpeakerLabels -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  number of speakers to identify in the input au-
                 dio. If there are more speakers in the audio than  this  num-
                 ber, multiple speakers are identified as a single speaker. If
                 you specify the MaxSpeakerLabels  field,  you  must  set  the
                 ShowSpeakerLabels field to true.

              ChannelIdentification -> (boolean)
                 Instructs  Amazon  Transcribe  to  process each audio channel
                 separately and then merge the transcription  output  of  each
                 channel into a single transcription.

                 Amazon  Transcribe also produces a transcription of each item
                 detected on an audio channel, including the  start  time  and
                 end  time  of  the item and alternative transcriptions of the
                 item including the confidence that Amazon Transcribe  has  in
                 the transcription.

                 You  can't  set both ShowSpeakerLabels and ChannelIdentifica-
                 tion in the same request. If you set both, your  request  re-
                 turns a BadRequestException .

              ShowAlternatives -> (boolean)
                 Determines  whether  the  transcription  contains alternative
                 transcriptions. If you  set  the  ShowAlternatives  field  to
                 true, you must also set the maximum number of alternatives to
                 return in the MaxAlternatives field.

              MaxAlternatives -> (integer)
                 The number of alternative  transcriptions  that  the  service
                 should  return. If you specify the MaxAlternatives field, you
                 must set the ShowAlternatives field to true.

              VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
                 The name of the vocabulary filter to  use  when  transcribing
                 the  audio.  The  filter  that you specify must have the same
                 language code as the transcription job.

              VocabularyFilterMethod -> (string)
                 Set to mask to remove filtered text from the  transcript  and
                 replace it with three asterisks ("
                 **

                 *
                 ") as placeholder text. Set to remove to remove filtered text
                 from the transcript without using placeholder  text.  Set  to
                 tag to mark the word in the transcription output that matches
                 the vocabulary filter. When you set the filter method to  tag
                 , the words matching your vocabulary filter are not masked or
                 removed.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 406)
                        Inline strong start-string without end-string.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 406)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          ModelSettings -> (structure)
              An object containing the details of your custom language model.

              LanguageModelName -> (string)
                 The name of your custom language model.

          JobExecutionSettings -> (structure)
              Provides information about how a transcription job is executed.

              AllowDeferredExecution -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether a job should be queued by Amazon Transcribe
                 when the concurrent execution limit is exceeded. When the Al-
                 lowDeferredExecution field is true, jobs are queued and  exe-
                 cuted  when the number of executing jobs falls below the con-
                 current execution limit. If the field is false, Amazon  Tran-
                 scribe returns a LimitExceededException exception.

                 Note  that job queuing is enabled by default for call analyt-
                 ics jobs.

                 If you specify the  AllowDeferredExecution  field,  you  must
                 specify the DataAccessRoleArn field.

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN),  in  the  form arn:parti-
                 tion:service:region:account-id:resource-type/resource-id , of
                 a role that has access to the S3 bucket that contains the in-
                 put files. Amazon Transcribe assumes this role to read queued
                 media  files.  If  you have specified an output S3 bucket for
                 the transcription results, this role should  have  access  to
                 the output bucket as well.

                 If  you  specify  the  AllowDeferredExecution field, you must
                 specify the DataAccessRoleArn field.

          ContentRedaction -> (structure)
              An object that describes  content  redaction  settings  for  the
              transcription job.

              RedactionType -> (string)
                 Request  parameter  that defines the entities to be redacted.
                 The only accepted value is PII .

              RedactionOutput -> (string)
                 The output transcript file stored in either  the  default  S3
                 bucket or in a bucket you specify.

                 When  you  choose redacted Amazon Transcribe outputs only the
                 redacted transcript.

                 When you  choose  redacted_and_unredacted  Amazon  Transcribe
                 outputs both the redacted and unredacted transcripts.

              PiiEntityTypes -> (list)
                 The  types  of  personally identifiable information (PII) you
                 want to redact in your transcript.

                 (string)

          IdentifyLanguage -> (boolean)
              A value that shows if automatic language identification was  en-
              abled for a transcription job.

          LanguageOptions -> (list)
              An  object  that  shows the optional array of languages inputted
              for transcription jobs with  automatic  language  identification
              enabled.

              (string)

          IdentifiedLanguageScore -> (float)
              A  value between zero and one that Amazon Transcribe assigned to
              the language that it identified in the source audio. Larger val-
              ues indicate that Amazon Transcribe has higher confidence in the
              language it identified.

          Tags -> (list)
              A key:value pair assigned to a given transcription job.

              (structure)
                 A key:value pair that adds metadata to  a  resource  used  by
                 Amazon Transcribe. For example, a tag with the key:value pair
                 Department:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its
                 use by your organization's sales department.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The first part of a key:value pair that forms a tag asso-
                     ciated with a given resource. For example, in the tag De-
                     partment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag as-
                     sociated with a given resource. For example, in  the  tag
                     Department:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

          Subtitles -> (structure)
              Generate subtitles for your batch transcription job.

              Formats -> (list)
                 The  format of your subtitle files. If your request specified
                 both srt and vtt formats, both formats are shown.
