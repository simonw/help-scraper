NAME
       list-call-analytics-categories -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  more  information  about  the  call analytics categories that
       you've created. You can use the information in this list to find a spe-
       cific  category. You can then use the operation to get more information
       about it.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-call-analytics-categories
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          When included, NextToken fetches the next set of categories  if  the
          result of the previous request was truncated.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum number of categories to return in each page of results.
          If there are fewer results than the value you specify, only the  ac-
          tual  results  are  returned. If you do not specify a value, the de-
          fault of 5 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The  operation returns a page of jobs at a time. The maximum size of
          the list is set by the MaxResults parameter. If there are more cate-
          gories in the list than the page size, Amazon Transcribe returns the
          NextPage token. Include the token in the next request to the  opera-
          tion to return the next page of analytics categories.

       Categories -> (list)
          A list of objects containing information about analytics categories.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  contains  the rules and additional information
              about a call analytics category.

              CategoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the call analytics category.

              Rules -> (list)
                 The rules used to create a call analytics category.

                 (structure)
                     A condition in the call  between  the  customer  and  the
                     agent that you want to filter for.

                     NonTalkTimeFilter -> (structure)
                        A  condition  for  a time period when neither the cus-
                        tomer nor the agent was talking.

                        Threshold -> (long)
                            The duration of the period when neither  the  cus-
                            tomer nor agent was talking.

                        AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                            An  object you can use to specify a time range (in
                            milliseconds) for when no one is talking. For  ex-
                            ample, you could specify a time period between the
                            30,000 millisecond mark and the 45,000 millisecond
                            mark.  You  could  also specify the time period as
                            the first 15,000 milliseconds or the  last  15,000
                            milliseconds.

                            StartTime -> (long)
                               A  value  that  indicates  the beginning of the
                               time range in seconds.  To  set  absolute  time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The  time range is set between 10,000 millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            EndTime -> (long)
                               A value that indicates  the  end  of  the  time
                               range  in  milliseconds.  To  set absolute time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The time range is set between 10,000  millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            First -> (long)
                               A  time range from the beginning of the call to
                               the value that you've specified.  For  example,
                               if  you  specify 100000 , the time range is set
                               to the first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (long)
                               A time range from the value that you've  speci-
                               fied  to  the  end of the call. For example, if
                               you specify 100000 , the time range is  set  to
                               the last 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                            An  object  that allows percentages to specify the
                            proportion of the call where  there  was  silence.
                            For example, you can specify the first half of the
                            call. You can also specify the period of time  be-
                            tween halfway through to three-quarters of the way
                            through the call. Because the length of  conversa-
                            tion  can  vary between calls, you can apply rela-
                            tive time ranges across all calls.

                            StartPercentage -> (integer)
                               A value that indicates the  percentage  of  the
                               beginning  of the time range. To set a relative
                               time range, you must specify a start percentage
                               and  an  end  percentage.  For  example, if you
                               specify the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This looks at the time range starting from  10%
                               of  the  way  into  the  call to 50% of the way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds,  this  example  range would apply
                               from the 10,000 millisecond mark to the  50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            EndPercentage -> (integer)
                               A  value  that  indicates the percentage of the
                               end of the time range. To set a  relative  time
                               range,  you must specify a start percentage and
                               an end percentage. For example, if you  specify
                               the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This  looks at the time range starting from 10%
                               of the way into the call  to  50%  of  the  way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds, this example  range  would  apply
                               from  the 10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            First -> (integer)
                               A range that takes the portion of the  call  up
                               to  the  time  in milliseconds set by the value
                               that you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you
                               specify  120000 , the time range is set for the
                               first 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (integer)
                               A range that takes the portion of the call from
                               the  time in milliseconds set by the value that
                               you've specified to the end of  the  call.  For
                               example, if you specify 120000 , the time range
                               is set for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the
                               call.

                        Negate -> (boolean)
                            Set  to TRUE to look for a time period when people
                            were talking.

                     InterruptionFilter -> (structure)
                        A condition for a time period when either the customer
                        or agent was interrupting the other person.

                        Threshold -> (long)
                            The duration of the interruption.

                        ParticipantRole -> (string)
                            Indicates  whether  the caller or customer was in-
                            terrupting.

                        AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                            An object you can use to specify a time range  (in
                            milliseconds)  for when you'd want to find the in-
                            terruption. For example, you could search  for  an
                            interruption  between  the 30,000 millisecond mark
                            and the 45,000 millisecond mark.  You  could  also
                            specify  the  time period as the first 15,000 mil-
                            liseconds or the last 15,000 milliseconds.

                            StartTime -> (long)
                               A value that indicates  the  beginning  of  the
                               time  range  in  seconds.  To set absolute time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The time range is set between 10,000  millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            EndTime -> (long)
                               A  value  that  indicates  the  end of the time
                               range in milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The  time range is set between 10,000 millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            First -> (long)
                               A time range from the beginning of the call  to
                               the  value  that you've specified. For example,
                               if you specify 100000 , the time range  is  set
                               to the first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (long)
                               A  time range from the value that you've speci-
                               fied to the end of the call.  For  example,  if
                               you  specify  100000 , the time range is set to
                               the last 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                            An object that allows percentages to  specify  the
                            proportion of the call where there was a interrup-
                            tion. For example, you can specify the first  half
                            of  the  call.  You can also specify the period of
                            time between halfway through to three-quarters  of
                            the  way  through  the call. Because the length of
                            conversation can vary between calls, you can apply
                            relative time ranges across all calls.

                            StartPercentage -> (integer)
                               A  value  that  indicates the percentage of the
                               beginning of the time range. To set a  relative
                               time range, you must specify a start percentage
                               and an end  percentage.  For  example,  if  you
                               specify the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This  looks at the time range starting from 10%
                               of the way into the call  to  50%  of  the  way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds, this example  range  would  apply
                               from  the 10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            EndPercentage -> (integer)
                               A value that indicates the  percentage  of  the
                               end  of  the time range. To set a relative time
                               range, you must specify a start percentage  and
                               an  end percentage. For example, if you specify
                               the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This looks at the time range starting from  10%
                               of  the  way  into  the  call to 50% of the way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds,  this  example  range would apply
                               from the 10,000 millisecond mark to the  50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            First -> (integer)
                               A  range  that takes the portion of the call up
                               to the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value
                               that  you've  specified.  For  example,  if you
                               specify 120000 , the time range is set for  the
                               first 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (integer)
                               A range that takes the portion of the call from
                               the time in milliseconds set by the value  that
                               you've  specified  to  the end of the call. For
                               example, if you specify 120000 , the time range
                               is set for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the
                               call.

                        Negate -> (boolean)
                            Set to TRUE to look for a time period where  there
                            was no interruption.

                     TranscriptFilter -> (structure)
                        A  condition  that catches particular words or phrases
                        based on a exact match. For example, if  you  set  the
                        phrase "I want to speak to the manager", only that ex-
                        act phrase will be returned.

                        TranscriptFilterType -> (string)
                            Matches the phrase to the transcription output  in
                            a word for word fashion. For example, if you spec-
                            ify the phrase "I want to speak to  the  manager."
                            Amazon  Transcribe attempts to match that specific
                            phrase to the transcription.

                        AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                            A time range, set in seconds, between  two  points
                            in the call.

                            StartTime -> (long)
                               A  value  that  indicates  the beginning of the
                               time range in seconds.  To  set  absolute  time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The  time range is set between 10,000 millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            EndTime -> (long)
                               A value that indicates  the  end  of  the  time
                               range  in  milliseconds.  To  set absolute time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The time range is set between 10,000  millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            First -> (long)
                               A  time range from the beginning of the call to
                               the value that you've specified.  For  example,
                               if  you  specify 100000 , the time range is set
                               to the first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (long)
                               A time range from the value that you've  speci-
                               fied  to  the  end of the call. For example, if
                               you specify 100000 , the time range is  set  to
                               the last 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                            An  object  that allows percentages to specify the
                            proportion of the call where you would like to ap-
                            ply  a  filter.  For  example, you can specify the
                            first half of the call. You can also  specify  the
                            period   of   time   between  halfway  through  to
                            three-quarters of the way through  the  call.  Be-
                            cause  the length of conversation can vary between
                            calls, you can apply relative time  ranges  across
                            all calls.

                            StartPercentage -> (integer)
                               A  value  that  indicates the percentage of the
                               beginning of the time range. To set a  relative
                               time range, you must specify a start percentage
                               and an end  percentage.  For  example,  if  you
                               specify the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This  looks at the time range starting from 10%
                               of the way into the call  to  50%  of  the  way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds, this example  range  would  apply
                               from  the 10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            EndPercentage -> (integer)
                               A value that indicates the  percentage  of  the
                               end  of  the time range. To set a relative time
                               range, you must specify a start percentage  and
                               an  end percentage. For example, if you specify
                               the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This looks at the time range starting from  10%
                               of  the  way  into  the  call to 50% of the way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds,  this  example  range would apply
                               from the 10,000 millisecond mark to the  50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            First -> (integer)
                               A  range  that takes the portion of the call up
                               to the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value
                               that  you've  specified.  For  example,  if you
                               specify 120000 , the time range is set for  the
                               first 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (integer)
                               A range that takes the portion of the call from
                               the time in milliseconds set by the value  that
                               you've  specified  to  the end of the call. For
                               example, if you specify 120000 , the time range
                               is set for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the
                               call.

                        ParticipantRole -> (string)
                            Determines whether the customer or  the  agent  is
                            speaking the phrases that you've specified.

                        Negate -> (boolean)
                            If  TRUE , the rule that you specify is applied to
                            everything except for the phrases that  you  spec-
                            ify.

                        Targets -> (list)
                            The  phrases  that you're specifying for the tran-
                            script filter to match.

                            (string)

                     SentimentFilter -> (structure)
                        A condition that is applied to a  particular  customer
                        sentiment.

                        Sentiments -> (list)
                            An  array  that  enables you to specify sentiments
                            for the customer or agent. You can specify one  or
                            more values.

                        AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                            The time range, measured in seconds, of the senti-
                            ment.

                            StartTime -> (long)
                               A value that indicates  the  beginning  of  the
                               time  range  in  seconds.  To set absolute time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The time range is set between 10,000  millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            EndTime -> (long)
                               A  value  that  indicates  the  end of the time
                               range in milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time
                               range, you must specify a start time and an end
                               time. For example, if you specify the following
                               values:

                               o StartTime - 10000

                               o Endtime - 50000

                               The  time range is set between 10,000 millisec-
                               onds and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                            First -> (long)
                               A time range from the beginning of the call  to
                               the  value  that you've specified. For example,
                               if you specify 100000 , the time range  is  set
                               to the first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (long)
                               A  time range from the value that you've speci-
                               fied to the end of the call.  For  example,  if
                               you  specify  100000 , the time range is set to
                               the last 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                            The time range, set in  percentages,  that  corre-
                            spond to proportion of the call.

                            StartPercentage -> (integer)
                               A  value  that  indicates the percentage of the
                               beginning of the time range. To set a  relative
                               time range, you must specify a start percentage
                               and an end  percentage.  For  example,  if  you
                               specify the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This  looks at the time range starting from 10%
                               of the way into the call  to  50%  of  the  way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds, this example  range  would  apply
                               from  the 10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            EndPercentage -> (integer)
                               A value that indicates the  percentage  of  the
                               end  of  the time range. To set a relative time
                               range, you must specify a start percentage  and
                               an  end percentage. For example, if you specify
                               the following values:

                               o StartPercentage - 10

                               o EndPercentage - 50

                               This looks at the time range starting from  10%
                               of  the  way  into  the  call to 50% of the way
                               through the call. For a call that lasts 100,000
                               milliseconds,  this  example  range would apply
                               from the 10,000 millisecond mark to the  50,000
                               millisecond mark.

                            First -> (integer)
                               A  range  that takes the portion of the call up
                               to the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value
                               that  you've  specified.  For  example,  if you
                               specify 120000 , the time range is set for  the
                               first 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                            Last -> (integer)
                               A range that takes the portion of the call from
                               the time in milliseconds set by the value  that
                               you've  specified  to  the end of the call. For
                               example, if you specify 120000 , the time range
                               is set for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the
                               call.

                        ParticipantRole -> (string)
                            A value that determines whether the sentiment  be-
                            longs to the customer or the agent.

                        Negate -> (boolean)
                            Set  to  TRUE  to look for sentiments that weren't
                            specified in the request.

              CreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A timestamp that shows when the call analytics  category  was
                 created.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  that shows when the call analytics category was
                 most recently updated.
