SYNOPSIS
            update-call-analytics-category
          --category-name <value>
          --rules <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --category-name (string)
          The  name of the analytics category to update. The name is case sen-
          sitive. If you try to update a call analytics category with the same
          name as a previous category you will receive a ConflictException er-
          ror.

       --rules (list)
          The rules used for the updated analytics category.  The  rules  that
          you  provide in this field replace the ones that are currently being
          used.

          (structure)
              A condition in the call between the customer and the agent  that
              you want to filter for.

              NonTalkTimeFilter -> (structure)
                 A  condition  for a time period when neither the customer nor
                 the agent was talking.

                 Threshold -> (long)
                     The duration of the period when neither the customer  nor
                     agent was talking.

                 AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                     An  object  you  can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                     liseconds) for when no one is talking. For  example,  you
                     could  specify a time period between the 30,000 millisec-
                     ond mark and the 45,000 millisecond mark. You could  also
                     specify  the time period as the first 15,000 milliseconds
                     or the last 15,000 milliseconds.

                     StartTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the beginning of the time range
                        in seconds. To set absolute time range, you must spec-
                        ify a start time and an end time. For example, if  you
                        specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     EndTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the end of the  time  range  in
                        milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time range, you must
                        specify a start time and an end time. For example,  if
                        you specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     First -> (long)
                        A time range from the beginning of  the  call  to  the
                        value that you've specified. For example, if you spec-
                        ify 100000 , the  time  range  is  set  to  the  first
                        100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Last -> (long)
                        A  time  range from the value that you've specified to
                        the end of the  call.  For  example,  if  you  specify
                        100000  ,  the  time  range is set to the last 100,000
                        milliseconds of the call.

                 RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                     An object that allows percentages to specify the  propor-
                     tion  of  the  call where there was silence. For example,
                     you can specify the first half of the call. You can  also
                     specify  the  period  of  time between halfway through to
                     three-quarters of the way through the call.  Because  the
                     length  of  conversation  can vary between calls, you can
                     apply relative time ranges across all calls.

                     StartPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of the beginning
                        of  the  time range. To set a relative time range, you
                        must specify a start percentage and an end percentage.
                        For example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of the
                        way into the call to 50% of the way through the  call.
                        For a call that lasts 100,000 milliseconds, this exam-
                        ple range would apply from the 10,000 millisecond mark
                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     EndPercentage -> (integer)
                        A  value  that  indicates the percentage of the end of
                        the time range. To set a relative time range, you must
                        specify  a start percentage and an end percentage. For
                        example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This looks at the time range starting from 10% of  the
                        way  into the call to 50% of the way through the call.
                        For a call that lasts 100,000 milliseconds, this exam-
                        ple range would apply from the 10,000 millisecond mark
                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     First -> (integer)
                        A range that takes the portion of the call up  to  the
                        time  in  milliseconds  set  by  the value that you've
                        specified. For example, if you specify  120000  ,  the
                        time  range  is set for the first 120,000 milliseconds
                        of the call.

                     Last -> (integer)
                        A range that takes the portion of the  call  from  the
                        time  in  milliseconds  set  by  the value that you've
                        specified to the end of the call. For example, if  you
                        specify  120000  ,  the time range is set for the last
                        120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                 Negate -> (boolean)
                     Set to TRUE to look for a time period  when  people  were
                     talking.

              InterruptionFilter -> (structure)
                 A  condition  for  a  time period when either the customer or
                 agent was interrupting the other person.

                 Threshold -> (long)
                     The duration of the interruption.

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Indicates whether the caller or customer  was  interrupt-
                     ing.

                 AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                     An  object  you  can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                     liseconds) for when you'd want to find the  interruption.
                     For example, you could search for an interruption between
                     the 30,000 millisecond mark and  the  45,000  millisecond
                     mark. You could also specify the time period as the first
                     15,000 milliseconds or the last 15,000 milliseconds.

                     StartTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the beginning of the time range
                        in seconds. To set absolute time range, you must spec-
                        ify a start time and an end time. For example, if  you
                        specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     EndTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the end of the  time  range  in
                        milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time range, you must
                        specify a start time and an end time. For example,  if
                        you specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     First -> (long)
                        A time range from the beginning of  the  call  to  the
                        value that you've specified. For example, if you spec-
                        ify 100000 , the  time  range  is  set  to  the  first
                        100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Last -> (long)
                        A  time  range from the value that you've specified to
                        the end of the  call.  For  example,  if  you  specify
                        100000  ,  the  time  range is set to the last 100,000
                        milliseconds of the call.

                 RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                     An object that allows percentages to specify the  propor-
                     tion  of the call where there was a interruption. For ex-
                     ample, you can specify the first half of  the  call.  You
                     can  also  specify  the  period  of  time between halfway
                     through to three-quarters of the way  through  the  call.
                     Because  the  length  of  conversation  can  vary between
                     calls, you can apply  relative  time  ranges  across  all
                     calls.

                     StartPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of the beginning
                        of the time range. To set a relative time  range,  you
                        must specify a start percentage and an end percentage.
                        For example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This looks at the time range starting from 10% of  the
                        way  into the call to 50% of the way through the call.
                        For a call that lasts 100,000 milliseconds, this exam-
                        ple range would apply from the 10,000 millisecond mark
                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     EndPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end  of
                        the time range. To set a relative time range, you must
                        specify a start percentage and an end percentage.  For
                        example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of the
                        way into the call to 50% of the way through the  call.

                        ple range would apply from the 10,000 millisecond mark
                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     First -> (integer)
                        A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've
                        specified.  For  example,  if you specify 120000 , the
                        time range is set for the first  120,000  milliseconds
                        of the call.

                     Last -> (integer)
                        A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've
                        specified  to the end of the call. For example, if you
                        specify 120000 , the time range is set  for  the  last
                        120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                 Negate -> (boolean)
                     Set  to TRUE to look for a time period where there was no
                     interruption.

              TranscriptFilter -> (structure)
                 A condition that catches particular words or phrases based on
                 a  exact match. For example, if you set the phrase "I want to
                 speak to the manager", only that exact  phrase  will  be  re-
                 turned.

                 TranscriptFilterType -> (string)
                     Matches  the phrase to the transcription output in a word
                     for word fashion. For example, if you specify the  phrase
                     "I  want  to speak to the manager." Amazon Transcribe at-
                     tempts to match that specific phrase  to  the  transcrip-
                     tion.

                 AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                     A  time  range, set in seconds, between two points in the
                     call.

                     StartTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the beginning of the time range
                        in seconds. To set absolute time range, you must spec-
                        ify a start time and an end time. For example, if  you
                        specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     EndTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the end of the  time  range  in
                        milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time range, you must
                        specify a start time and an end time. For example,  if
                        you specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     First -> (long)
                        A time range from the beginning of  the  call  to  the
                        value that you've specified. For example, if you spec-
                        ify 100000 , the  time  range  is  set  to  the  first
                        100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Last -> (long)
                        A  time  range from the value that you've specified to
                        the end of the  call.  For  example,  if  you  specify
                        100000  ,  the  time  range is set to the last 100,000
                        milliseconds of the call.

                 RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                     An object that allows percentages to specify the  propor-
                     tion  of the call where you would like to apply a filter.
                     For example, you can specify the first half of the  call.
                     You  can  also specify the period of time between halfway
                     through to three-quarters of the way  through  the  call.
                     Because  the  length  of  conversation  can  vary between
                     calls, you can apply  relative  time  ranges  across  all
                     calls.

                     StartPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of the beginning
                        of the time range. To set a relative time  range,  you
                        must specify a start percentage and an end percentage.
                        For example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This looks at the time range starting from 10% of  the
                        way  into the call to 50% of the way through the call.
                        For a call that lasts 100,000 milliseconds, this exam-
                        ple range would apply from the 10,000 millisecond mark
                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     EndPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end  of
                        the time range. To set a relative time range, you must
                        specify a start percentage and an end percentage.  For
                        example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of the
                        way into the call to 50% of the way through the  call.

                        to the 50,000 millisecond mark.

                     First -> (integer)
                        A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've
                        specified.  For  example,  if you specify 120000 , the
                        time range is set for the first  120,000  milliseconds
                        of the call.

                     Last -> (integer)
                        A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've
                        specified  to the end of the call. For example, if you
                        specify 120000 , the time range is set  for  the  last
                        120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     Determines  whether the customer or the agent is speaking
                     the phrases that you've specified.

                 Negate -> (boolean)
                     If TRUE , the rule that you specify is applied to  every-
                     thing except for the phrases that you specify.

                 Targets -> (list)
                     The  phrases  that  you're  specifying for the transcript
                     filter to match.

                     (string)

              SentimentFilter -> (structure)
                 A condition that is applied to a particular  customer  senti-
                 ment.

                 Sentiments -> (list)
                     An  array  that enables you to specify sentiments for the
                     customer or agent. You can specify one or more values.

                     (string)

                 AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                     The time range, measured in seconds, of the sentiment.

                     StartTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the beginning of the time range
                        in seconds. To set absolute time range, you must spec-
                        ify a start time and an end time. For example, if  you
                        specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     EndTime -> (long)
                        A value that indicates the end of the  time  range  in
                        milliseconds.  To  set  absolute  time range, you must
                        specify a start time and an end time. For example,  if
                        you specify the following values:

                        o StartTime - 10000

                        o Endtime - 50000

                        The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds and
                        50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                     First -> (long)
                        A time range from the beginning of  the  call  to  the
                        value that you've specified. For example, if you spec-
                        ify 100000 , the  time  range  is  set  to  the  first
                        100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Last -> (long)
                        A  time  range from the value that you've specified to
                        the end of the  call.  For  example,  if  you  specify
                        100000  ,  the  time  range is set to the last 100,000
                        milliseconds of the call.

                 RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                     The time range, set in percentages,  that  correspond  to
                     proportion of the call.

                     StartPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of the beginning
                        of the time range. To set a relative time  range,  you
                        must specify a start percentage and an end percentage.
                        For example, if you specify the following values:

                        o StartPercentage - 10

                        o EndPercentage - 50

                        This looks at the time range starting from 10% of  the
                        way  into the call to 50% of the way through the call.

                     EndPercentage -> (integer)
                        A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end  of
                        the time range. To set a relative time range, you must
                        specify a start percentage and an end percentage.  For
                        example, if you specify the following values:

                     First -> (integer)
                        A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've
                        specified.  For  example,  if you specify 120000 , the
                        time range is set for the first  120,000  milliseconds
                        of the call.

                     Last -> (integer)
                        A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from the
                        time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that  you've

                 ParticipantRole -> (string)
                     A  value that determines whether the sentiment belongs to
                     the customer or the agent.

                 Negate -> (boolean)
                     Set to TRUE to look for sentiments that weren't specified
                     in the request.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CategoryProperties -> (structure)
          The attributes describing the analytics category. You can see infor-
          mation such as the rules that you've used to update the category and
          when the category was originally created.

          CategoryName -> (string)
              The name of the call analytics category.

          Rules -> (list)
              The rules used to create a call analytics category.

              (structure)
                 A condition in the call between the customer  and  the  agent
                 that you want to filter for.

                 NonTalkTimeFilter -> (structure)
                     A  condition  for a time period when neither the customer
                     nor the agent was talking.

                     Threshold -> (long)
                        The duration of the period when neither  the  customer
                        nor agent was talking.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object you can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                        liseconds) for when no one is  talking.  For  example,
                        you  could  specify  a  time period between the 30,000
                        millisecond mark and the 45,000 millisecond mark.  You
                        could also specify the time period as the first 15,000
                        milliseconds or the last 15,000 milliseconds.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion of the call where there was silence. For exam-
                        ple, you can specify the first half of the  call.  You
                        can  also  specify  the period of time between halfway
                        through to three-quarters of the way through the call.
                        Because  the  length  of conversation can vary between
                        calls, you can apply relative time ranges  across  all
                        calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that indicates the percentage of the be-
                            ginning of the time range. To set a relative  time
                            range,  you must specify a start percentage and an
                            end percentage. For example, if  you  specify  the
                            following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the
                            10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000  millisecond
                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set to TRUE to look for a time period when people were
                        talking.

                 InterruptionFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition for a time period when either the customer or
                     agent was interrupting the other person.

                     Threshold -> (long)
                        The duration of the interruption.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        Indicates  whether  the  caller or customer was inter-
                        rupting.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object you can use to specify a time range (in mil-
                        liseconds)  for  when you'd want to find the interrup-
                        tion. For example, you could search for  an  interrup-
                        tion  between  the  30,000  millisecond  mark  and the
                        45,000 millisecond mark. You could  also  specify  the
                        time  period  as  the first 15,000 milliseconds or the
                        last 15,000 milliseconds.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion  of  the  call where there was a interruption.
                        For example, you can specify the  first  half  of  the
                        call.  You can also specify the period of time between
                        halfway through to three-quarters of the  way  through
                        the  call. Because the length of conversation can vary
                        between calls, you  can  apply  relative  time  ranges
                        across all calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that indicates the percentage of the be-
                            ginning of the time range. To set a relative  time
                            range,  you must specify a start percentage and an
                            end percentage. For example, if  you  specify  the
                            following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-

                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-

                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set  to TRUE to look for a time period where there was
                        no interruption.

                 TranscriptFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition that  catches  particular  words  or  phrases
                     based  on  a  exact  match.  For  example, if you set the
                     phrase "I want to speak to the manager", only that  exact
                     phrase will be returned.

                     TranscriptFilterType -> (string)
                        Matches  the  phrase  to the transcription output in a
                        word for word fashion. For example, if you specify the
                        phrase  "I want to speak to the manager." Amazon Tran-
                        scribe attempts to match that specific phrase  to  the
                        transcription.

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        A  time  range,  set in seconds, between two points in
                        the call.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the beginning of  the  time
                            range  in seconds. To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A value that indicates the end of the  time  range
                            in  milliseconds.  To set absolute time range, you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The  time range is set between 10,000 milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value  that  you've specified. For example, if you
                            specify 100000 , the time  range  is  set  to  the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A  time range from the value that you've specified
                            to the end of the call. For example, if you  spec-
                            ify  100000  ,  the  time range is set to the last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        An object that allows percentages to specify the  pro-
                        portion  of  the  call where you would like to apply a
                        filter. For example, you can specify the first half of
                        the  call. You can also specify the period of time be-
                        tween halfway through to  three-quarters  of  the  way
                        through  the  call. Because the length of conversation
                        can vary between calls, you can  apply  relative  time
                        ranges across all calls.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that indicates the percentage of the be-
                            ginning of the time range. To set a relative  time
                            range,  you must specify a start percentage and an
                            end percentage. For example, if  you  specify  the
                            following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-
                            onds, this example  range  would  apply  from  the
                            10,000  millisecond mark to the 50,000 millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  end
                            of  the  time range. To set a relative time range,
                            you must specify a start  percentage  and  an  end
                            percentage.  For  example, if you specify the fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the
                            10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000  millisecond
                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A  range  that takes the portion of the call up to
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've  specified.  For  example,  if  you specify
                            120000 , the time  range  is  set  for  the  first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A  range  that  takes the portion of the call from
                            the time in milliseconds set  by  the  value  that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        Determines whether the customer or the agent is speak-
                        ing the phrases that you've specified.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        If TRUE , the rule that you specify is applied to  ev-
                        erything except for the phrases that you specify.

                     Targets -> (list)
                        The  phrases that you're specifying for the transcript
                        filter to match.

                        (string)

                 SentimentFilter -> (structure)
                     A condition that is applied to a particular customer sen-
                     timent.

                     Sentiments -> (list)
                        An  array  that  enables you to specify sentiments for
                        the customer or agent. You can  specify  one  or  more
                        values.

                        (string)

                     AbsoluteTimeRange -> (structure)
                        The time range, measured in seconds, of the sentiment.

                        StartTime -> (long)
                            A  value  that indicates the beginning of the time
                            range in seconds. To set absolute time range,  you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The time range is set between 10,000  milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        EndTime -> (long)
                            A  value  that indicates the end of the time range
                            in milliseconds. To set absolute time  range,  you
                            must specify a start time and an end time. For ex-
                            ample, if you specify the following values:

                            o StartTime - 10000

                            o Endtime - 50000

                            The time range is set between 10,000  milliseconds
                            and 50,000 milliseconds into the call.

                        First -> (long)
                            A time range from the beginning of the call to the
                            value that you've specified. For example,  if  you
                            specify  100000  ,  the  time  range is set to the
                            first 100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (long)
                            A time range from the value that you've  specified
                            to  the end of the call. For example, if you spec-
                            ify 100000 , the time range is  set  to  the  last
                            100,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     RelativeTimeRange -> (structure)
                        The time range, set in percentages, that correspond to
                        proportion of the call.

                        StartPercentage -> (integer)
                            A value that indicates the percentage of  the  be-
                            ginning  of the time range. To set a relative time
                            range, you must specify a start percentage and  an
                            end  percentage.  For  example, if you specify the
                            following values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This looks at the time range starting from 10%  of
                            the  way  into  the call to 50% of the way through
                            the call. For a call that lasts 100,000  millisec-
                            onds,  this  example  range  would  apply from the
                            10,000 millisecond mark to the 50,000  millisecond
                            mark.

                        EndPercentage -> (integer)
                            A  value  that indicates the percentage of the end
                            of the time range. To set a relative  time  range,
                            you  must  specify  a  start percentage and an end
                            percentage. For example, if you specify  the  fol-
                            lowing values:

                            o StartPercentage - 10

                            o EndPercentage - 50

                            This  looks at the time range starting from 10% of
                            the way into the call to 50% of  the  way  through
                            the  call. For a call that lasts 100,000 millisec-

                            mark.

                        First -> (integer)
                            A range that takes the portion of the call  up  to
                            the  time  in  milliseconds  set by the value that
                            you've specified.  For  example,  if  you  specify
                            120000  ,  the  time  range  is  set for the first
                            120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                        Last -> (integer)
                            A range that takes the portion of  the  call  from
                            the  time  in  milliseconds  set by the value that
                            you've specified to the end of the call. For exam-
                            ple, if you specify 120000 , the time range is set
                            for the last 120,000 milliseconds of the call.

                     ParticipantRole -> (string)
                        A value that determines whether the sentiment  belongs
                        to the customer or the agent.

                     Negate -> (boolean)
                        Set to TRUE to look for sentiments that weren't speci-
                        fied in the request.

          CreateTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the call analytics category was cre-
              ated.

          LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
              A timestamp that shows when the call analytics category was most
              recently updated.
