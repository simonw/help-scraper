       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-vocabulary-filter
          --vocabulary-filter-name <value>
          --language-code <value>
          [--words <value>]

          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --vocabulary-filter-name (string)
          The vocabulary filter name. The name must be unique within  the  ac-
          count  that  contains  it.  If you try to create a vocabulary filter
          with the same name as another vocabulary  filter,  you  get  a  Con-
          flictException error.

       --language-code (string)
          The  language  code of the words in the vocabulary filter. All words
          in the filter must be in the same language.  The  vocabulary  filter
          can only be used with transcription jobs in the specified language.

       --words (list)
          The  words to use in the vocabulary filter. Only use characters from
          the character set defined for custom vocabularies.  For  a  list  of
          character sets, see Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          If you provide a list of words in the Words parameter, you can't use
          the VocabularyFilterFileUri parameter.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vocabulary-filter-file-uri (string)
          The Amazon S3 location of a text file used as input  to  create  the
          vocabulary  filter.  Only  use characters from the character set de-
          fined for custom vocabularies. For a list  of  character  sets,  see
          Character Sets for Custom Vocabularies .

          The specified file must be less than 50 KB of UTF-8 characters.

          If you provide the location of a list of words in the VocabularyFil-
          terFileUri parameter, you can't use the Words parameter.

       --tags (list)
          Adds one or more tags, each in the form of a key:value  pair,  to  a
          new  Amazon Transcribe vocabulary filter at the time you create this
          new vocabulary filter.

          (structure)
              A key:value pair that adds metadata to a resource used by Amazon
              Transcribe.  For  example, a tag with the key:value pair Depart-
              ment:Sales might be added to a resource to indicate its  use  by
              your organization's sales department.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  first  part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the key is 'Department'.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  second part of a key:value pair that forms a tag associ-
                 ated with a given resource. For example, in the  tag  Depart-
                 ment:Sales, the value is 'Sales'.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a vocabulary filter

       The following create-vocabulary-filter  example  creates  a  vocabulary
       filter  that  uses  a  text file that contains a list of words that you
       wouldn't want to appear in a transcription. For language-code,  specify
       the language code corresponding to the language of your vocabulary fil-
       ter. For vocabulary-filter-file-uri, specify the Amazon Simple  Storage
       Service  (Amazon  S3) URI of the text file. For vocabulary-filter-name,
       specify the name of your vocabulary filter.

          aws transcribe create-vocabulary-filter \
              --language-code language-code \
              --vocabulary-filter-file-uri s3://DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/vocabulary-filter.txt \
              --vocabulary-filter-name cli-vocabulary-filter-example

       Output:

          {
              "VocabularyFilterName": "cli-vocabulary-filter-example",
              "LanguageCode": "language-code"
          }

       For more information, see Filtering Unwanted Words in the Amazon  Tran-
       scribe Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       VocabularyFilterName -> (string)
          The name of the vocabulary filter.

       LanguageCode -> (string)
          The language code of the words in the collection.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the vocabulary filter was modified.
