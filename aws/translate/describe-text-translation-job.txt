NAME
       describe-text-translation-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the  properties associated with an asynchronous batch translation
       job including name, ID, status, source and target languages, input/out-
       put S3 buckets, and so on.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-text-translation-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The  identifier  that  Amazon  Translate  generated for the job. The
          StartTextTranslationJob operation returns this identifier in its re-
          sponse.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 are calling.

              ContentType -> (string)
                 Describes  the  format  of the data that you submit to Amazon
                 Translate as input. You can specify one of the following mul-
                 tipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                 o text/html  :  The  input  data consists of one or more HTML
                   files. Amazon Translate translates only the text  that  re-
                   sides in the html element in each file.

                 o text/plain  : The input data consists of one or more unfor-
                   matted text files. Amazon Translate translates every  char-
                   acter in this type of input.

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocess-
                   ingml.document : The input data consists  of  one  or  more
                   Word documents (.docx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                   tionml.presentation : The input data  consists  of  one  or
                   more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                 o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                   sheetml.sheet : The input data consists of one or more  Ex-
                   cel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                 o application/x-xliff+xml : The input data consists of one or
                   more XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) files
                   (.xlf). Amazon Translate supports only XLIFF version 1.2.

                 WARNING:
                     If you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that you
                     set this parameter to text/html . By doing  so,  you  cut
                     costs  by limiting the translation to the contents of the
                     html element in each file. Otherwise, if you set this pa-
                     rameter  to text/plain , your costs will cover the trans-
                     lation of every character.

          OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
              The output configuration properties that were specified when the
              job was requested.

              S3Uri -> (string)
                 The  URI  of  the S3 folder that contains a translation job's
                 output file. The folder must be in the same Region as the API
                 endpoint that you are calling.

              EncryptionKey -> (structure)
                 The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The  type  of  encryption key used by Amazon Translate to
                     encrypt this object.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key  be-
                     ing used to encrypt this object.

          DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access and
              Management (IAM) role that granted Amazon Translate read  access
              to the job's input data.

          Settings -> (structure)
              Settings that configure the translation output.

              Profanity -> (string)
                 Enable  the profanity setting if you want Amazon Translate to
                 mask profane words and phrases in your translation output.

                 To mask profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate  replaces
                 them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-character sequence
                 is used for each profane word or phrase,  regardless  of  the
                 length or number of words.

                 Amazon Translate does not detect profanity in all of its sup-
                 ported languages. For languages that support profanity detec-
                 tion,  see Supported Languages and Language Codes in the Ama-
                 zon Translate Developer Guide .
