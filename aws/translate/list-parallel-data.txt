LIST-PARALLEL-DATA()                                      LIST-PARALLEL-DATA()



NAME
       list-parallel-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides a list of your parallel data resources in Amazon Translate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-parallel-data
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          A string that specifies the next page of results to return in a pag-
          inated response.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of parallel data resources returned for each  re-
          quest.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the parallel data resource. When  the  parallel

                 The  source language of the translations in the parallel data
                 file.

                 The language codes for the target languages available in  the
                 parallel  data  file.  All  possible target languages are re-

              ParallelDataConfig -> (structure)
                 Specifies the format and S3 location of the parallel data in-
                 put file.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  URI of the Amazon S3 folder that contains the paral-
                     lel data input file. The folder must be in the  same  Re-
                     gion as the API endpoint you are calling.

                 Format -> (string)

                 from  the parallel data input file. This number includes only
                 the characters in your translation examples. It does not  in-
                 clude characters that are used to format your file. For exam-

              SkippedRecordCount -> (long)
                 The  number  of items in the input file that Amazon Translate
                 skipped when you created or updated  the  parallel  data  re-

                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the encryption key be-
                     ing used to encrypt this object.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
