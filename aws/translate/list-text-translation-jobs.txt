SYNOPSIS
            list-text-translation-jobs
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          The  parameters  that  specify  which  batch translation jobs to re-
          trieve. Filters include job name, job status, and  submission  time.
          You can only set one filter at a time.

          JobName -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs by name.

          JobStatus -> (string)
              Filters the list of jobs based by job status.

          SubmittedBeforeTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted for processing and returns only the jobs submitted before
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in ascending order, oldest
              to newest.

          SubmittedAfterTime -> (timestamp)
              Filters the list of jobs based on the time that the job was sub-
              mitted  for processing and returns only the jobs submitted after
              the specified time. Jobs are returned in descending order,  new-
              est to oldest.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          JobName=string,JobStatus=string,SubmittedBeforeTime=timestamp,SubmittedAfterTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "JobName": "string",
            "JobStatus": "SUBMITTED"|"IN_PROGRESS"|"COMPLETED"|"COMPLETED_WITH_ERROR"|"FAILED"|"STOP_REQUESTED"|"STOPPED",
            "SubmittedBeforeTime": timestamp,
            "SubmittedAfterTime": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token to request the next page of results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to return in each page. The default
          value is 100.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     endpoint you are calling.

                 ContentType -> (string)
                     Describes the format of the data that you submit to  Ama-
                     zon  Translate  as input. You can specify one of the fol-
                     lowing multipurpose internet mail extension (MIME) types:

                     o text/html : The input data consists of one or more HTML
                       files.  Amazon  Translate translates only the text that
                       resides in the html element in each file.

                     o text/plain : The input data consists of one or more un-
                       formatted text files. Amazon Translate translates every
                       character in this type of input.

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordpro-
                       cessingml.document  : The input data consists of one or
                       more Word documents (.docx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presenta-
                       tionml.presentation : The input data consists of one or
                       more PowerPoint Presentation files (.pptx).

                     o application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spread-
                       sheetml.sheet  : The input data consists of one or more
                       Excel Workbook files (.xlsx).

                     o application/x-xliff+xml : The input  data  consists  of
                       one  or  more  XML Localization Interchange File Format
                       (XLIFF) files (.xlf). Amazon  Translate  supports  only
                       XLIFF version 1.2.

                     WARNING:
                        If  you structure your input data as HTML, ensure that
                        you set this parameter to text/html . By doing so, you
                        cut  costs by limiting the translation to the contents
                        of the html element in each file.  Otherwise,  if  you
                        set  this  parameter  to  text/plain , your costs will
                        cover the translation of every character.

              OutputDataConfig -> (structure)
                 The output configuration properties that were specified  when
                 the job was requested.

                 S3Uri -> (string)
                     The  URI  of  the  S3  folder that contains a translation
                     job's output file. The folder must be in the same  Region
                     as the API endpoint that you are calling.

                 EncryptionKey -> (structure)
                     The encryption key used to encrypt this object.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of encryption key used by Amazon Translate to
                        encrypt this object.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  encryption  key

              DataAccessRoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Identity Access and

                     to mask profane words and  phrases  in  your  translation
                     output.

                     To  mask  profane words and phrases, Amazon Translate re-
                     places them with the grawlix string ?$#@$. This 5-charac-
                     ter sequence is used for each profane word or phrase, re-
                     gardless of the length or number of words.

                     Amazon Translate does not detect profanity in all of  its
                     supported languages. For languages that support profanity
                     detection, see Supported Languages and Language Codes  in
                     the Amazon Translate Developer Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
