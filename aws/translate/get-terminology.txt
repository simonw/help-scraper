OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the custom terminology being retrieved.

       --terminology-data-format (string)
          The data format of the custom terminology being retrieved.

          If you don't specify this parameter, Amazon Translate returns a file
          with the same format as the file that was  imported  to  create  the
          terminology.

          If  you specify this parameter when you retrieve a multi-directional
          terminology resource, you must specify the same format as the  input
          file  that  was  imported  to create it. Otherwise, Amazon Translate
          throws an error.

          Possible values:

          o CSV

          o TMX

          o TSV

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

          WARNING:
              Amazon  Translate  doesn't  scan all input files for the risk of
              CSV injection attacks.

              CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that
              a  record contains malicious code. The record begins with a spe-
              cial character, such as =, +, -, or @. When the file  is  opened
              in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record
              as a formula and run the code within it.

              Before you download an input file from Amazon  S3,  ensure  that
              you recognize the file and trust its creator.
