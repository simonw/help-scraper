GET-PARALLEL-DATA()                                        GET-PARALLEL-DATA()



NAME
       get-parallel-data -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides information about a parallel data resource.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-parallel-data
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the parallel data resource that is being retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          WARNING:
              Amazon Translate doesn't scan all input files for  the  risk  of
              CSV injection attacks.

              CSV injection occurs when a .csv or .tsv file is altered so that
              a record contains malicious code. The record begins with a  spe-
              cial  character,  such as =, +, -, or @. When the file is opened
              in a spreadsheet program, the program might interpret the record
              as a formula and run the code within it.

              Before  you  download  an input file from Amazon S3, ensure that
              you recognize the file and trust its creator.

          RepositoryType -> (string)
              Describes the repository that contains the parallel  data  input
              file.

          Location -> (string)

              cation is returned as a presigned URL to that  has  a  30-minute
