NAME
       list-fhir-datastores -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all FHIR Data Stores that are in the users account, regardless of
       Data Store status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-fhir-datastores
          [--filter <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Lists all filters associated with a FHIR Data Store request.

          DatastoreName -> (string)
              Allows the user to filter Data Store results by name.

          DatastoreStatus -> (string)
              Allows the user to filter Data Store results by status.

          CreatedBefore -> (timestamp)
              A filter that allows the user to set cutoff dates  for  records.
              All  Data  Stores  created before the specified date will be in-
              cluded in the results.

          CreatedAfter -> (timestamp)
              A filter that allows the user to set cutoff dates  for  records.
              All  Data  Stores  created  after the specified date will be in-
              cluded in the results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DatastoreName=string,DatastoreStatus=string,CreatedBefore=timestamp,CreatedAfter=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DatastoreName": "string",
            "DatastoreStatus": "CREATING"|"ACTIVE"|"DELETING"|"DELETED",
            "CreatedBefore": timestamp,
            "CreatedAfter": timestamp
          }

       --next-token (string)
          Fetches the next page of Data Stores when results are paginated.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of Data Stores returned in a  single  page  of  a
          ListFHIRDatastoresRequest call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list FHIR Data Stores

       The following list-fhir-datastores example shows to how to use the com-
       mand and how users can filter results based on  Data  Store  status  in
       Amazon HealthLake.

          aws healthlake list-fhir-datastores \
              --region us-east-1 \
              --filter DatastoreStatus=ACTIVE

       Output:

          {
              "DatastorePropertiesList": [
              {
                  "PreloadDataConfig": {
                      "PreloadDataType": "SYNTHEA"
                  },
                  "DatastoreName": "FhirTestDatastore",
                  "DatastoreArn": "arn:aws:healthlake:us-east-1:<AWS Account ID>:datastore/<Datastore ID>",
                  "DatastoreEndpoint": "https://healthlake.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datastore/<Datastore ID>/r4/",
                  "DatastoreStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "DatastoreTypeVersion": "R4",
                  "CreatedAt": 1605574003.209,
                  "DatastoreId": "<Datastore ID>"
              },
              {
                  "DatastoreName": "Demo",
                  "DatastoreArn": "arn:aws:healthlake:us-east-1:<AWS Account ID>:datastore/<Datastore ID>",
                  "DatastoreEndpoint": "https://healthlake.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/datastore/<Datastore ID>/r4/",
                  "DatastoreStatus": "ACTIVE",
                  "DatastoreTypeVersion": "R4",
                  "CreatedAt": 1603761064.881,
                  "DatastoreId": "<Datastore ID>"
              }
              ]
          }
