NAME
       describe-fhir-export-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  the  properties  of a FHIR export job, including the ID, ARN,
       name, and the status of the job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fhir-export-job
          --datastore-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --datastore-id (string)
          The AWS generated ID for the Data Store from which files  are  being
          exported from for an export job.

       --job-id (string)
          The AWS generated ID for an export job.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a FHIR export job

       The following describe-fhir-export-job example shows how  to  find  the
       properties of a FHIR export job in Amazon HealthLake.

          aws healthlake describe-fhir-export-job \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --job-id 9b9a51943afaedd0a8c0c26c49135a31

       Output:

          {
              "ExportJobProperties": {
                  "DataAccessRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::(AWS Account ID):role/(Role Name)",
                  "JobStatus": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "JobId": "9009813e9d69ba7cf79bcb3468780f16",
                  "SubmitTime": 1609175692.715,
                  "OutputDataConfig": {
                      "S3Uri": "s3://(Bucket Name)/(Prefix Name)/59593b2d0367ce252b5e66bf5fd6b574-FHIR_EXPORT-9009813e9d69ba7cf79bcb3468780f16/"
                  },
                  "DatastoreId": "(Datastore ID)"
              }
          }
