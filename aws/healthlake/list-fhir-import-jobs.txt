SYNOPSIS
            list-fhir-import-jobs
          --datastore-id <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--job-name <value>]
          [--job-status <value>]
          [--submitted-before <value>]
          [--submitted-after <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --datastore-id (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied Data Store ID.

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination token used to identify the next page of results to re-
          turn for a ListFHIRImportJobs query.

       --max-results (integer)
          This parameter limits the number of results returned for a ListFHIR-
          ImportJobs to a maximum quantity specified by the user.

       --job-name (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied job name.

       --job-status (string)
          This parameter limits the response to the import job with the speci-
          fied job status.

          Possible values:

          o SUBMITTED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --submitted-before (timestamp)
          This parameter limits the response to FHIR import jobs submitted be-
          fore a user specified date.

       --submitted-after (timestamp)
          This parameter limits the response to FHIR import jobs submitted af-
          ter a user specified date.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list all FHIR import jobs

       The  following  list-fhir-import-jobs example shows how to use the com-
       mand to view a list of all import jobs associated with an account.

          aws healthlake list-fhir-import-jobs \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --submitted-before (DATE like 2024-10-13T19:00:00Z) \
              --submitted-after (DATE like 2020-10-13T19:00:00Z ) \
              --job-name "FHIR-IMPORT" \
              --job-status SUBMITTED  \
              -max-results (Integer between 1 and 500)

       Output:

          {
