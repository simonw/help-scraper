DESCRIBE-FHIR-IMPORT-JOB()                          DESCRIBE-FHIR-IMPORT-JOB()



NAME
       describe-fhir-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  the  properties  of a FHIR import job, including the ID, ARN,
       name, and the status of the job.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-fhir-import-job
          --datastore-id <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --datastore-id (string)
          The AWS-generated ID of the Data Store.

       --job-id (string)
          The AWS-generated job ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a FHIR import job

       The following describe-fhir-import-job example shows how to  learn  the
       properties of a FHIR import job using Amazon HealthLake.

          aws healthlake describe-fhir-import-job \
              --datastore-id (Datastore ID) \
              --job-id c145fbb27b192af392f8ce6e7838e34f \
              --region us-east-1

       Output:

          {
              "ImportJobProperties": {
              "InputDataConfig": {
                  "S3Uri": "s3://(Bucket Name)/(Prefix Name)/"
                  { "arrayitem2": 2 }
              },
              "DataAccessRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::(AWS Account ID):role/(Role Name)",
              "JobStatus": "COMPLETED",
              "JobId": "c145fbb27b192af392f8ce6e7838e34f",
              "SubmitTime": 1606272542.161,
              "EndTime": 1606272609.497,
              "DatastoreId": "(Datastore ID)"
              }
          }
