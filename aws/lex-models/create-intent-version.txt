CREATE-INTENT-VERSION()                                CREATE-INTENT-VERSION()



NAME
       create-intent-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new version of an intent based on the $LATEST version of the
       intent. If the $LATEST version of this intent hasn't changed since  you
       last  updated  it,  Amazon Lex doesn't create a new version. It returns
       the last version you created.

       NOTE:
          You can update only the $LATEST version of the intent. You can't up-
          date the numbered versions that you create with the CreateIntentVer-
          sion operation.

       When you create a version of an intent, Amazon Lex sets the version  to
       1.  Subsequent versions increment by 1. For more information, see  ver-
       sioning-intro .

       This operation requires permissions to perform the lex:CreateIntentVer-
       sion action.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the intent that you want to create a new version of. The
          name is case sensitive.

       --checksum (string)
          Checksum of the $LATEST version of the intent that should be used to
          create  the  new  version. If you specify a checksum and the $LATEST
          version of the intent has a different checksum, Amazon Lex returns a
          PreconditionFailedException exception and doesn't publish a new ver-
          sion. If you don't specify a  checksum,  Amazon  Lex  publishes  the
          $LATEST version.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              Identifies the version of a specific slot.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot.

              slotType -> (string)
                 The  type of the slot, either a custom slot type that you de-
                 fined or one of the built-in slot types.

              slotTypeVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the slot type.

              valueElicitationPrompt -> (structure)
                 The prompt that Amazon Lex uses to elicit the slot value from
                 the user.

                 messages -> (list)
                     An  array  of  objects,  each of which provides a message
                     string and its type. You can specify the  message  string
                     in  plain  text  or  in  Speech Synthesis Markup Language
                     (SSML).

                     (structure)
                        The message object that provides the message text  and
                        its type.

                        contentType -> (string)
                            The content type of the message string.

                        content -> (string)
                            The text of the message.

                        groupNumber -> (integer)
                            Identifies  the message group that the message be-
                            longs to. When a group is assigned to  a  message,
                            Amazon  Lex returns one message from each group in
                            the response.

                 maxAttempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to prompt the user for information.

                 responseCard -> (string)
                     A response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at  runtime,
                     in  the PostText API response. It substitutes session at-
                     tributes and slot values for placeholders in the response
                     card. For more information, see  ex-resp-card .

              priority -> (integer)
                 Directs  Amazon  Lex  the  order in which to elicit this slot
                 value from the user. For example, if the intent has two slots
                 with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Amazon Lex first elicits a value
                 for the slot with priority 1.

                 If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which
                 Amazon Lex elicits values is arbitrary.

              sampleUtterances -> (list)
                 If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond
                 to an Amazon Lex request for a slot value,  you  can  provide
                 those  utterances  to  improve accuracy. This is optional. In
                 most cases, Amazon Lex is capable of understanding  user  ut-
                 terances.

                 (string)

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A  set  of  possible  responses  for  the  slot  type used by
                 text-based clients. A user chooses an  option  from  the  re-
                 sponse card, instead of using text to reply.

              obfuscationSetting -> (string)
                 Determines  whether a slot is obfuscated in conversation logs
                 and stored utterances. When you obfuscate a slot,  the  value
                 is  replaced by the slot name in curly braces ({}). For exam-
                 ple, if the slot name is "full_name", obfuscated  values  are
                 replaced  with  "{full_name}". For more information, see Slot
                 Obfuscation .

              defaultValueSpec -> (structure)
                 A list of default values for the  slot.  Default  values  are
                 used  when  Amazon  Lex hasn't determined a value for a slot.
                 You can specify default values from context  variables,  ses-
                 sion attributes, and defined values.

                 defaultValueList -> (list)
                     The  default values for a slot. You can specify more than
                     one default. For example, you can specify a default value
                     to use from a matching context variable, a session attri-
                     bute, or a fixed value.

                     The default value chosen is selected based on  the  order
                     that  you  specify  them in the list. For example, if you
                     specify a context variable and a fixed value in that  or-
                     der, Amazon Lex uses the context variable if it is avail-
                     able, else it uses the fixed value.

                     (structure)
                        A default value for a slot.

                        defaultValue -> (string)
                            The default value for the slot.  You  can  specify
                            one of the following:

                            o #context-name.slot-name   -   The   slot   value
                              "slot-name" in the context "context-name."

                            o {attribute} - The slot value of the session  at-
                              tribute "attribute."

                            o 'value' - The discrete value "value."
