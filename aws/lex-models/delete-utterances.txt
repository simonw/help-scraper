DELETE-UTTERANCES()                                        DELETE-UTTERANCES()



NAME
       delete-utterances -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes stored utterances.

       Amazon  Lex  stores  the utterances that users send to your bot. Utter-
       ances are stored for 15 days for use with the  GetUtterancesView opera-
       tion,  and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the ability of
       your bot to respond to user input.

       Use the DeleteUtterances operation to manually delete stored utterances
       for  a  specific user. When you use the DeleteUtterances operation, ut-
       terances stored for improving your bot's ability to respond to user in-
       put  are deleted immediately. Utterances stored for use with the GetUt-
       terancesView operation are deleted after 15 days.

       This operation requires permissions for  the  lex:DeleteUtterances  ac-
       tion.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-utterances
          --bot-name <value>
          --user-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --bot-name (string)
          The name of the bot that stored the utterances.

       --user-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the user that made the utterances. This is
          the user ID that was sent in the PostContent or  PostText  operation
          request that contained the utterance.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
