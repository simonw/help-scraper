          [--sort-by-attribute <value>]
          [--sort-by-order <value>]
          [--v1-bot-name-contains <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sort-by-attribute (string)
          The  field  to  sort  the list of migrations by. You can sort by the
          Amazon Lex V1 bot name or the date and time that the  migration  was
          started.

          Possible values:

          o V1_BOT_NAME

          o MIGRATION_DATE_TIME

       --sort-by-order (string)
          The order so sort the list.

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --v1-bot-name-contains (string)
          Filters the list to contain only bots whose name contains the speci-
          fied string. The string is matched anywhere in bot name.

       --migration-status-equals (string)
          Filters the list to contain only migrations in the specified state.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of migrations to return in the response. The  de-
          fault is 10.

       --next-token (string)
          A  pagination token that fetches the next page of migrations. If the
          response to this operation is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a  pagi-
          nation  token in the response. To fetch the next page of migrations,
          specify the pagination token in the request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
