PUT-BOT()                                                            PUT-BOT()



NAME
       put-bot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Amazon Lex conversational bot or replaces an existing bot.
       When you create or update a bot you are  only  required  to  specify  a
       name,  a  locale, and whether the bot is directed toward children under
       age 13. You can use this to add intents later,  or  to  remove  intents
       from  an  existing bot. When you create a bot with the minimum informa-
       tion, the bot is created or updated but Amazon Lex returns the response
       FAILED  .  You can build the bot after you add one or more intents. For
       more information about Amazon Lex bots, see  how-it-works .

       If you specify the name of an existing bot, the fields in  the  request
       replace  the  existing values in the $LATEST version of the bot. Amazon
       Lex removes any fields that you don't provide values  for  in  the  re-
       quest,  except  for  the  idleTTLInSeconds  and privacySettings fields,
       which are set to their default values. If you don't specify values  for
       required fields, Amazon Lex throws an exception.

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutBot action. For more
       information, see  security-iam .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the bot. The name is not case sensitive.

       --description (string)
          A description of the bot.

       --intents (list)
          An array of Intent objects. Each intent represents a command that  a
          user can express. For example, a pizza ordering bot might support an
          OrderPizza intent. For more information, see  how-it-works .

          (structure)
              Identifies the specific version of an intent.

              intentName -> (string)
                 The name of the intent.

              intentVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the intent.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          intentName=string,intentVersion=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "intentName": "string",
              "intentVersion": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --enable-model-improvements | --no-enable-model-improvements (boolean)
          Set to true to enable access to natural language  understanding  im-
          provements.

          When  you  set the enableModelImprovements parameter to true you can
          use the nluIntentConfidenceThreshold parameter to  configure  confi-
          dence scores. For more information, see Confidence Scores .

          You  can  only  set the enableModelImprovements parameter in certain
          Regions. If you set the parameter to true , your bot has  access  to
          accuracy improvements.

          The  Regions where you can set the enableModelImprovements parameter
          to true are:

          o US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

          o US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

          o Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)

          o EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)

          In other Regions, the enableModelImprovements parameter  is  set  to
          true  by  default.  In  these Regions setting the parameter to false
          throws a ValidationException exception.

       --nlu-intent-confidence-threshold (double)
          Determines the threshold where  Amazon  Lex  will  insert  the  AMA-
          ZON.FallbackIntent  ,  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent  , or both when re-
          turning alternative intents in a PostContent or  PostText  response.
          AMAZON.FallbackIntent  and  AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent  are  only in-
          serted if they are configured for the bot.

          You must set the enableModelImprovements parameter to  true  to  use
          confidence scores in the following regions.

          o US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)

          o US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)

          o Asia Pacific (Sydney) (ap-southeast-2)

          o EU (Ireland) (eu-west-1)

          In  other  Regions,  the enableModelImprovements parameter is set to
          true by default.

          For example, suppose a bot is configured with the confidence thresh-
          old of 0.80 and the AMAZON.FallbackIntent . Amazon Lex returns three
          alternative intents with the following  confidence  scores:  IntentA
          (0.70),  IntentB (0.60), IntentC (0.50). The response from the Post-
          Text operation would be:

          o AMAZON.FallbackIntent

          o IntentA

          o IntentB

          o IntentC

       --clarification-prompt (structure)
          When Amazon Lex doesn't understand the user's intent, it  uses  this
          message  to  get clarification. To specify how many times Amazon Lex
          should repeat the clarification prompt, use the  maxAttempts  field.
          If  Amazon Lex still doesn't understand, it sends the message in the
          abortStatement field.

          When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that  it  suggests
          the  correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that or-
          ders pizza and drinks, you might create this  clarification  prompt:
          "What  would you like to do? You can say 'Order a pizza' or 'Order a
          drink.'"

          If you have defined a fallback intent, it will  be  invoked  if  the
          clarification  prompt is repeated the number of times defined in the
          maxAttempts field. For more information, see AMAZON.FallbackIntent .

          If you don't define a clarification prompt, at  runtime  Amazon  Lex
          will return a 400 Bad Request exception in three cases:

          o Follow-up  prompt  -  When the user responds to a follow-up prompt
            but does not provide an intent. For example, in response to a fol-
            low-up  prompt that says "Would you like anything else today?" the
            user says "Yes." Amazon Lex will return a 400 Bad  Request  excep-
            tion  because  it  does not have a clarification prompt to send to
            the user to get an intent.

          o Lambda function - When using a  Lambda  function,  you  return  an
            ElicitIntent  dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a clari-
            fication prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns  a  400
            Bad Request exception.

          o PutSession  operation  -  When using the PutSession operation, you
            send an ElicitIntent dialog type. Since Amazon Lex does not have a
            clarification  prompt to get an intent from the user, it returns a
            400 Bad Request exception.

          messages -> (list)
              An array of objects, each of which provides a message string and
              its type. You can specify the message string in plain text or in
              Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

              (structure)
                 The message object that provides the  message  text  and  its
                 type.

                 contentType -> (string)
                     The content type of the message string.

                 content -> (string)
                     The text of the message.

                 groupNumber -> (integer)
                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

          maxAttempts -> (integer)
              The number of times to prompt the user for information.

          responseCard -> (string)
              A  response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime, in the
              PostText API response. It  substitutes  session  attributes  and
              slot  values for placeholders in the response card. For more in-
              formation, see  ex-resp-card .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          messages=[{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer},{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer}],maxAttempts=integer,responseCard=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "messages": [
              {
                "contentType": "PlainText"|"SSML"|"CustomPayload",
                "content": "string",
                "groupNumber": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "maxAttempts": integer,
            "responseCard": "string"
          }

       --abort-statement (structure)
          When Amazon Lex can't understand the user's  input  in  context,  it
          tries  to elicit the information a few times. After that, Amazon Lex
          sends the message defined in abortStatement to the  user,  and  then
          cancels the conversation. To set the number of retries, use the val-
          ueElicitationPrompt field for the slot type.

          For example, in a pizza ordering bot, Amazon Lex might  ask  a  user
          "What  type  of crust would you like?" If the user's response is not
          one of the expected  responses  (for  example,  "thin  crust,  "deep
          dish,"  etc.),  Amazon  Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few
          more times.

          For example, in a pizza ordering application,  OrderPizza  might  be
          one  of  the  intents. This intent might require the CrustType slot.
          You specify the valueElicitationPrompt field  when  you  create  the
          CrustType slot.

          If  you have defined a fallback intent the cancel statement will not
          be sent to the user, the fallback intent is used instead.  For  more
          information, see AMAZON.FallbackIntent .

          messages -> (list)
              A collection of message objects.

              (structure)
                 The  message  object  that  provides the message text and its
                 type.

                 contentType -> (string)
                     The content type of the message string.

                 content -> (string)
                     The text of the message.

                 groupNumber -> (integer)
                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

          responseCard -> (string)
              At runtime, if the client is using the PostText API, Amazon  Lex
              includes  the  response card in the response. It substitutes all
              of the session attributes and slot values  for  placeholders  in
              the response card.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          messages=[{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer},{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer}],responseCard=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "messages": [
              {
                "contentType": "PlainText"|"SSML"|"CustomPayload",
                "content": "string",
                "groupNumber": integer
              }
              ...
            ],
            "responseCard": "string"
          }

       --idle-session-ttl-in-seconds (integer)
          The  maximum  time in seconds that Amazon Lex retains the data gath-
          ered in a conversation.

          A user interaction session remains active for  the  amount  of  time
          specified.  If  no conversation occurs during this time, the session
          expires and Amazon Lex deletes any data provided before the timeout.

          For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent,  but
          gets  sidetracked  halfway  through  placing  an  order. If the user
          doesn't complete the order within the  specified  time,  Amazon  Lex
          discards  the  slot  information that it gathered, and the user must
          start over.

          If you don't include the idleSessionTTLInSeconds element in a PutBot
          operation  request,  Amazon Lex uses the default value. This is also
          true if the request replaces an existing bot.

          The default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

       --voice-id (string)
          The Amazon Polly voice ID that you want Amazon Lex to use for  voice
          interactions with the user. The locale configured for the voice must
          match the locale of the bot. For more  information,  see  Voices  in
          Amazon Polly in the Amazon Polly Developer Guide .

       --checksum (string)
          Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version.

          When  you  create  a new bot, leave the checksum field blank. If you
          specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception.

          When you want to update a bot, set the checksum field to the  check-
          sum of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If you don't
          specify the checksum field, or if the checksum does  not  match  the
          $LATEST version, you get a PreconditionFailedException exception.

       --process-behavior (string)
          If  you set the processBehavior element to BUILD , Amazon Lex builds
          the bot so that it can be run. If you set the element to SAVE Amazon
          Lex saves the bot, but doesn't build it.

          If you don't specify this value, the default value is BUILD .

          Possible values:

          o SAVE

          o BUILD

       --locale (string)
          Specifies  the target locale for the bot. Any intent used in the bot
          must be compatible with the locale of the bot.

          The default is en-US .

          Possible values:

          o de-DE

          o en-AU

          o en-GB

          o en-IN

          o en-US

          o es-419

          o es-ES

          o es-US

          o fr-FR

          o fr-CA

          o it-IT

          o ja-JP

          o ko-KR

       --child-directed | --no-child-directed (boolean)
          For each Amazon Lex bot created with the Amazon Lex  Model  Building
          Service,  you must specify whether your use of Amazon Lex is related
          to a website, program, or other application that is directed or tar-
          geted,  in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to
          the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)  by  specifying
          true  or false in the childDirected field. By specifying true in the
          childDirected field, you confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is  re-
          lated  to  a website, program, or other application that is directed
          or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and  sub-
          ject  to  COPPA. By specifying false in the childDirected field, you
          confirm that your use of Amazon Lex is not  related  to  a  website,
          program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole
          or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA.  You  may
          not  specify  a  default value for the childDirected field that does
          not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related  to
          a  website,  program,  or other application that is directed or tar-
          geted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject  to
          COPPA.

          If  your  use  of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other
          application that is directed in whole or in part, to children  under
          age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent un-
          der COPPA. For information regarding the use of Amazon Lex  in  con-
          nection  with websites, programs, or other applications that are di-
          rected or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under  age  13,
          see the Amazon Lex FAQ.

       --detect-sentiment | --no-detect-sentiment (boolean)
          When  set  to true user utterances are sent to Amazon Comprehend for
          sentiment analysis. If you don't specify detectSentiment ,  the  de-
          fault is false .

       --create-version | --no-create-version (boolean)
          When  set to true a new numbered version of the bot is created. This
          is the same as calling the CreateBotVersion operation. If you  don't
          specify createVersion , the default is false .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags  to add to the bot. You can only add tags when you
          create a bot, you can't use the PutBot operation to update the  tags
          on a bot. To update tags, use the TagResource operation.

          (structure)
              A list of key/value pairs that identify a bot, bot alias, or bot
              channel. Tag keys and values can  consist  of  Unicode  letters,
              digits, white space, and any of the following symbols: _ . : / =
              + - @.

              key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. Keys are not case-sensitive and must  be
                 unique.

              value -> (string)
                 The  value  associated  with a key. The value may be an empty
                 string but it can't be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.
