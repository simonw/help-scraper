PUT-INTENT()                                                      PUT-INTENT()



NAME
       put-intent -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an intent or replaces an existing intent.

       To define the interaction between the user and your bot, you use one or
       more intents. For a pizza ordering bot, for example, you  would  create
       an OrderPizza intent.

       To create an intent or replace an existing intent, you must provide the
       following:

       o Intent name. For example, OrderPizza .

       o Sample utterances. For example, "Can I order a pizza, please." and "I
         want to order a pizza."

       o Information  to  be gathered. You specify slot types for the informa-
         tion that your bot will request from the user. You can specify  stan-
         dard  slot types, such as a date or a time, or custom slot types such
         as the size and crust of a pizza.

       o How the intent will be fulfilled. You can provide a  Lambda  function
         or  configure  the  intent  to  return  the intent information to the
         client application. If you use a Lambda function, when all of the in-
         tent  information  is available, Amazon Lex invokes your Lambda func-
         tion. If you configure your intent to return the  intent  information
         to the client application.

       You can specify other optional information in the request, such as:

       o A confirmation prompt to ask the user to confirm an intent. For exam-
         ple, "Shall I order your pizza?"

       o A conclusion statement to send to the user after the intent has  been
         fulfilled. For example, "I placed your pizza order."

       o A  follow-up  prompt  that asks the user for additional activity. For
         example, asking "Do you want to order a drink with your pizza?"

       If you specify an existing intent name to update the intent, Amazon Lex
       replaces  the values in the $LATEST version of the intent with the val-
       ues in the request. Amazon Lex removes fields that you don't provide in
       the  request.  If  you  don't  specify  the required fields, Amazon Lex
       throws an exception. When you update the $LATEST version of an  intent,
       the status field of any bot that uses the $LATEST version of the intent
       is set to NOT_BUILT .

       For more information, see  how-it-works .

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:PutIntent action.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the intent. The name is not case sensitive.

          The name can't match a built-in intent name, or  a  built-in  intent
          name  with  "AMAZON."  removed.  For  example,  because  there  is a
          built-in intent called AMAZON.HelpIntent , you can't create a custom
          intent called HelpIntent .

          For a list of built-in intents, see Standard Built-in Intents in the
          Alexa Skills Kit .

       --description (string)
          A description of the intent.

       --slots (list)
          An array of intent slots. At runtime, Amazon  Lex  elicits  required
          slot  values  from  the user using prompts defined in the slots. For
          more information, see  how-it-works .

          (structure)
              Identifies the version of a specific slot.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot.

              slotConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the slot is required or optional.

              slotType -> (string)
                 The type of the slot, either a custom slot type that you  de-
                 fined or one of the built-in slot types.

              slotTypeVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the slot type.

              valueElicitationPrompt -> (structure)
                 The prompt that Amazon Lex uses to elicit the slot value from
                 the user.

                 messages -> (list)
                     An array of objects, each of  which  provides  a  message
                     string  and  its type. You can specify the message string
                     in plain text or  in  Speech  Synthesis  Markup  Language
                     (SSML).

                     (structure)
                        The  message object that provides the message text and
                        its type.

                        contentType -> (string)
                            The content type of the message string.

                        content -> (string)
                            The text of the message.

                        groupNumber -> (integer)
                            Identifies the message group that the message  be-
                            longs  to.  When a group is assigned to a message,
                            Amazon Lex returns one message from each group  in
                            the response.

                 maxAttempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to prompt the user for information.

                 responseCard -> (string)
                     A  response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime,
                     in the PostText API response. It substitutes session  at-
                     tributes and slot values for placeholders in the response
                     card. For more information, see  ex-resp-card .

              priority -> (integer)
                 Directs Amazon Lex the order in which  to  elicit  this  slot
                 value from the user. For example, if the intent has two slots
                 with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Amazon Lex first elicits a value
                 for the slot with priority 1.

                 If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which
                 Amazon Lex elicits values is arbitrary.

              sampleUtterances -> (list)
                 If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond
                 to  an  Amazon  Lex request for a slot value, you can provide
                 those utterances to improve accuracy. This  is  optional.  In
                 most  cases,  Amazon Lex is capable of understanding user ut-
                 terances.

                 (string)

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A set of  possible  responses  for  the  slot  type  used  by
                 text-based  clients.  A  user  chooses an option from the re-
                 sponse card, instead of using text to reply.

              obfuscationSetting -> (string)
                 Determines whether a slot is obfuscated in conversation  logs
                 and  stored  utterances. When you obfuscate a slot, the value
                 is replaced by the slot name in curly braces ({}). For  exam-
                 ple,  if  the slot name is "full_name", obfuscated values are
                 replaced with "{full_name}". For more information,  see  Slot
                 Obfuscation .

              defaultValueSpec -> (structure)
                 A  list  of  default  values for the slot. Default values are
                 used when Amazon Lex hasn't determined a value  for  a  slot.
                 You  can  specify default values from context variables, ses-
                 sion attributes, and defined values.

                 defaultValueList -> (list)
                     The default values for a slot. You can specify more  than
                     one default. For example, you can specify a default value
                     to use from a matching context variable, a session attri-
                     bute, or a fixed value.

                     The  default  value chosen is selected based on the order
                     that you specify them in the list. For  example,  if  you
                     specify  a context variable and a fixed value in that or-
                     der, Amazon Lex uses the context variable if it is avail-
                     able, else it uses the fixed value.

                     (structure)
                        A default value for a slot.

                        defaultValue -> (string)
                            The  default  value  for the slot. You can specify
                            one of the following:

                            o #context-name.slot-name   -   The   slot   value
                              "slot-name" in the context "context-name."

                            o {attribute}  - The slot value of the session at-
                              tribute "attribute."

                            o 'value' - The discrete value "value."

            }
            ...
          ]

       --sample-utterances (list)
          An array of utterances (strings) that a user might say to signal the
          intent.  For  example, "I want {PizzaSize} pizza", "Order {Quantity}
          {PizzaSize} pizzas".

          In each utterance, a slot name is enclosed in curly braces.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --confirmation-prompt (structure)
          Prompts the user to confirm the intent. This question should have  a
          yes or no answer.

          Amazon  Lex  uses  this  prompt to ensure that the user acknowledges
          that the intent is ready for fulfillment. For example, with the  Or-
          derPizza intent, you might want to confirm that the order is correct
          before placing it. For other intents, such as  intents  that  simply
          respond  to  user  questions, you might not need to ask the user for
          confirmation before providing the information.

          NOTE:
              You you must provide both the rejectionStatement and the confir-
              mationPrompt , or neither.

          messages -> (list)
              An array of objects, each of which provides a message string and
              its type. You can specify the message string in plain text or in
              Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

              (structure)
                 The  message  object  that  provides the message text and its
                 type.

                 contentType -> (string)
                     The content type of the message string.

                 content -> (string)
                     The text of the message.

                 groupNumber -> (integer)
                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

          maxAttempts -> (integer)
              The number of times to prompt the user for information.

          responseCard -> (string)
              A response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime, in  the
              PostText  API  response.  It  substitutes session attributes and
              slot values for placeholders in the response card. For more  in-
              formation, see  ex-resp-card .

       Shorthand Syntax:

       --rejection-statement (structure)
          When  the user answers "no" to the question defined in confirmation-
          Prompt , Amazon Lex responds with this statement to acknowledge that
          the intent was canceled.

          NOTE:
              You  must  provide both the rejectionStatement and the confirma-
              tionPrompt , or neither.

          messages -> (list)
              A collection of message objects.

              (structure)
                 The message object that provides the  message  text  and  its
                 type.

                 contentType -> (string)
                     The content type of the message string.

                 content -> (string)
                     The text of the message.

                 groupNumber -> (integer)
                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

          responseCard -> (string)
              At  runtime, if the client is using the PostText API, Amazon Lex
              includes the response card in the response. It  substitutes  all
              of  the  session  attributes and slot values for placeholders in
              the response card.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          messages=[{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer},{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer}],responseCard=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "messages": [
              {
                "contentType": "PlainText"|"SSML"|"CustomPayload",

            ],
            "responseCard": "string"
          }

       --follow-up-prompt (structure)
          Amazon Lex uses this prompt to  solicit  additional  activity  after
          fulfilling  an  intent.  For example, after the OrderPizza intent is
          fulfilled, you might prompt the user to order a drink.

          The action that Amazon Lex takes depends on the user's response,  as
          follows:

          o If  the  user says "Yes" it responds with the clarification prompt
            that is configured for the bot.

          o if the user says "Yes" and continues with an utterance that  trig-
            gers an intent it starts a conversation for the intent.

          o If  the  user  says  "No" it responds with the rejection statement
            configured for the the follow-up prompt.

          o If it doesn't recognize the utterance  it  repeats  the  follow-up
            prompt again.

          The followUpPrompt field and the conclusionStatement field are mutu-
          ally exclusive. You can specify only one.

          prompt -> (structure)
              Prompts for information from the user.

              messages -> (list)
                 An array of objects, each of which provides a message  string
                 and  its  type.  You  can specify the message string in plain
                 text or in Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).

                 (structure)
                     The message object that provides the message text and its
                     type.

                     contentType -> (string)
                        The content type of the message string.

                     content -> (string)
                        The text of the message.

                     groupNumber -> (integer)
                        Identifies  the message group that the message belongs
                        to. When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon  Lex
                        returns one message from each group in the response.

              maxAttempts -> (integer)
                 The number of times to prompt the user for information.

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A  response  card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime, in
                 the PostText API response. It substitutes session  attributes
                 and  slot  values  for placeholders in the response card. For
                 more information, see  ex-resp-card .

          rejectionStatement -> (structure)
              If the user answers "no" to the question defined in  the  prompt
              field,  Amazon  Lex  responds with this statement to acknowledge
              that the intent was canceled.

              messages -> (list)
                 A collection of message objects.

                 (structure)
                     The message object that provides the message text and its
                     type.

                     contentType -> (string)
                        The content type of the message string.

                     content -> (string)
                        The text of the message.

                     groupNumber -> (integer)
                        Identifies  the message group that the message belongs
                        to. When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon  Lex
                        returns one message from each group in the response.

              responseCard -> (string)
                 At  runtime,  if the client is using the PostText API, Amazon
                 Lex includes the response card in the  response.  It  substi-
                 tutes  all  of  the  session  attributes  and slot values for
                 placeholders in the response card.

       --conclusion-statement (structure)
          The statement that you want Amazon Lex to convey to the  user  after
          the intent is successfully fulfilled by the Lambda function.

          This  element  is  relevant only if you provide a Lambda function in
          the fulfillmentActivity . If you return the intent to the client ap-
          plication, you can't specify this element.

          NOTE:
              The  followUpPrompt  and conclusionStatement are mutually exclu-
              sive. You can specify only one.

          messages -> (list)
              A collection of message objects.

              (structure)
                 The message object that provides the  message  text  and  its
                 type.

                 contentType -> (string)
                     The content type of the message string.

                 content -> (string)
                     The text of the message.

                 groupNumber -> (integer)
                     Identifies the message group that the message belongs to.
                     When a group is assigned to a message, Amazon Lex returns
                     one message from each group in the response.

          responseCard -> (string)
              At  runtime, if the client is using the PostText API, Amazon Lex
              includes the response card in the response. It  substitutes  all
              of  the  session  attributes and slot values for placeholders in
              the response card.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          messages=[{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer},{contentType=string,content=string,groupNumber=integer}],responseCard=string

       JSON Syntax:

       --dialog-code-hook (structure)
          Specifies a Lambda function to invoke for each user input.  You  can
          invoke this Lambda function to personalize user interaction.

          For example, suppose your bot determines that the user is John. Your
          Lambda function might retrieve John's  information  from  a  backend
          database  and  prepopulate  some  of the values. For example, if you
          find that John is gluten intolerant, you might set the corresponding
          intent slot, GlutenIntolerant , to true. You might find John's phone
          number and set the corresponding session attribute.

          uri -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function.

          messageVersion -> (string)
              The version of the request-response that you want Amazon Lex  to
              use  to  invoke  your Lambda function. For more information, see
              using-lambda .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          uri=string,messageVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "uri": "string",
            "messageVersion": "string"
          }

       --fulfillment-activity (structure)
          Required. Describes how the intent is fulfilled. For example,  after
          a  user  provides all of the information for a pizza order, fulfill-
          mentActivity defines how the bot places an order with a local  pizza
          store.

          You  might configure Amazon Lex to return all of the intent informa-
          tion to the client application, or direct  it  to  invoke  a  Lambda
          function  that  can  process the intent (for example, place an order
          with a pizzeria).

          type -> (string)
              How the intent should be fulfilled, either by running  a  Lambda
              function  or  by  returning the slot data to the client applica-
              tion.

          codeHook -> (structure)
              A description of the Lambda function that is run to fulfill  the
              intent.

              uri -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Lambda function.

              messageVersion -> (string)
                 The  version of the request-response that you want Amazon Lex
                 to use to invoke your Lambda function. For more  information,
                 see  using-lambda .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          type=string,codeHook={uri=string,messageVersion=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "type": "ReturnIntent"|"CodeHook",
            "codeHook": {
              "uri": "string",
              "messageVersion": "string"
            }
          }

       --parent-intent-signature (string)
          A  unique identifier for the built-in intent to base this intent on.
          To find the signature for an intent, see Standard  Built-in  Intents
          in the Alexa Skills Kit .

       --checksum (string)
          Identifies a specific revision of the $LATEST version.

          When you create a new intent, leave the checksum field blank. If you
          specify a checksum you get a BadRequestException exception.

          When you want to update a intent, set  the  checksum  field  to  the
          checksum  of the most recent revision of the $LATEST version. If you
          don't specify the checksum field, or if the checksum does not  match
          the  $LATEST  version,  you get a PreconditionFailedException excep-
          tion.

       --create-version | --no-create-version (boolean)
          When set to true a new numbered version of the  intent  is  created.
          This  is  the  same as calling the CreateIntentVersion operation. If
          you do not specify createVersion , the default is false .

       --kendra-configuration (structure)
          Configuration information required to use the AMAZON.KendraSearchIn-
          tent  intent to connect to an Amazon Kendra index. For more informa-
          tion, see AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent .

          kendraIndex -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Kendra  index  that
              you want the AMAZON.KendraSearchIntent intent to search. The in-
              dex must be in the same account and Region  as  the  Amazon  Lex
              bot.  If  the Amazon Kendra index does not exist, you get an ex-
              ception when you call the PutIntent operation.

          queryFilterString -> (string)
              A query filter that Amazon Lex sends to Amazon Kendra to  filter
              the response from the query. The filter is in the format defined
              by Amazon Kendra. For more information, see Filtering queries .

              You can override this filter string with a new filter string  at
              runtime.

          role -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that has permis-
              sion to search the Amazon Kendra index. The role must be in  the
              same  account and Region as the Amazon Lex bot. If the role does
              not exist, you get an exception when you call the PutIntent  op-
              eration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          kendraIndex=string,queryFilterString=string,role=string

          }

       --input-contexts (list)
          An  array  of InputContext objects that lists the contexts that must
          be active for Amazon Lex to choose the intent in a conversation with
          the user.

          (structure)
              The  name  of  a context that must be active for an intent to be
              selected by Amazon Lex.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [

          ]

       --output-contexts (list)
          An array of OutputContext objects that lists the contexts  that  the
          intent activates when the intent is fulfilled.

          (structure)
              The  specification  of an output context that is set when an in-
              tent is fulfilled.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the context.

              timeToLiveInSeconds -> (integer)
                 The number of seconds that the context should be active after
                 it  is  first sent in a PostContent or PostText response. You
                 can set the value between 5 and 86,400 seconds (24 hours).

              turnsToLive -> (integer)
                 The number of conversation turns that the context  should  be
                 active.  A  conversation  turn is one PostContent or PostText
                 request and the corresponding response from Amazon Lex.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,timeToLiveInSeconds=integer,turnsToLive=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       name -> (string)
          The name of the intent.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the intent.

       slots -> (list)
          An array of intent slots that are configured for the intent.

          (structure)
              Identifies the version of a specific slot.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot.

              slotConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the slot is required or optional.

              slotType -> (string)
                 The type of the slot, either a custom slot type that you  de-
                 fined or one of the built-in slot types.

              slotTypeVersion -> (string)
                 The version of the slot type.

              valueElicitationPrompt -> (structure)
                 The prompt that Amazon Lex uses to elicit the slot value from
                 the user.

                 messages -> (list)
                     An array of objects, each of  which  provides  a  message
                     string  and  its type. You can specify the message string
                     in plain text or  in  Speech  Synthesis  Markup  Language
                     (SSML).

                     (structure)
                        The  message object that provides the message text and
                        its type.

                        contentType -> (string)
                            The content type of the message string.

                        content -> (string)
                            The text of the message.

                        groupNumber -> (integer)
                            Identifies the message group that the message  be-
                            longs  to.  When a group is assigned to a message,
                            Amazon Lex returns one message from each group  in
                            the response.

                 maxAttempts -> (integer)
                     The number of times to prompt the user for information.

                 responseCard -> (string)
                     A  response card. Amazon Lex uses this prompt at runtime,
                     in the PostText API response. It substitutes session  at-
                     tributes and slot values for placeholders in the response
                     card. For more information, see  ex-resp-card .

              priority -> (integer)
                 Directs Amazon Lex the order in which  to  elicit  this  slot
                 value from the user. For example, if the intent has two slots
                 with priorities 1 and 2, AWS Amazon Lex first elicits a value
                 for the slot with priority 1.

                 If multiple slots share the same priority, the order in which
                 Amazon Lex elicits values is arbitrary.

              sampleUtterances -> (list)
                 If you know a specific pattern with which users might respond
                 to  an  Amazon  Lex request for a slot value, you can provide
                 those utterances to improve accuracy. This  is  optional.  In
                 most  cases,  Amazon Lex is capable of understanding user ut-
                 terances.

                 (string)

              responseCard -> (string)
                 A set of  possible  responses  for  the  slot  type  used  by
                 text-based  clients.  A  user  chooses an option from the re-
                 sponse card, instead of using text to reply.

              obfuscationSetting -> (string)
                 Determines whether a slot is obfuscated in conversation  logs
                 and  stored  utterances. When you obfuscate a slot, the value
                 is replaced by the slot name in curly braces ({}). For  exam-
                 ple,  if  the slot name is "full_name", obfuscated values are
                 replaced with "{full_name}". For more information,  see  Slot
                 Obfuscation .

              defaultValueSpec -> (structure)
                 A  list  of  default  values for the slot. Default values are
                 used when Amazon Lex hasn't determined a value  for  a  slot.
                 You  can  specify default values from context variables, ses-
                 sion attributes, and defined values.

                 defaultValueList -> (list)
                     The default values for a slot. You can specify more  than
                     one default. For example, you can specify a default value
                     to use from a matching context variable, a session attri-
                     bute, or a fixed value.

                     The  default  value chosen is selected based on the order
                     that you specify them in the list. For  example,  if  you
                     specify  a context variable and a fixed value in that or-
                     der, Amazon Lex uses the context variable if it is avail-
                     able, else it uses the fixed value.
