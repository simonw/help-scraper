DELETE-SLOT-TYPE()                                          DELETE-SLOT-TYPE()



NAME
       delete-slot-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all  versions of the slot type, including the $LATEST version.
       To delete a specific version of the slot type, use the  DeleteSlotType-
       Version operation.

       You  can  delete a version of a slot type only if it is not referenced.
       To delete a slot type that is referred to in one or more  intents,  you
       must remove those references first.

       NOTE:
          If  you get the ResourceInUseException exception, the exception pro-
          vides an example reference that shows the intent where the slot type
          is  referenced. To remove the reference to the slot type, either up-
          date the intent or delete it. If you get the same exception when you
          attempt  to  delete  the slot type again, repeat until the slot type
          has no references and the DeleteSlotType call is successful.

       This operation requires permission for the lex:DeleteSlotType action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-slot-type
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type. The name is case sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
