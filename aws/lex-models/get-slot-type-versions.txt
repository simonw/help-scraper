GET-SLOT-TYPE-VERSIONS()                              GET-SLOT-TYPE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       get-slot-type-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about all versions of a slot type.

       The GetSlotTypeVersions operation returns a SlotTypeMetadata object for
       each version of a slot type. For example, if a slot type has three num-
       bered  versions,  the  GetSlotTypeVersions operation returns four Slot-
       TypeMetadata objects in the response, one for each numbered version and
       one for the $LATEST version.

       The  GetSlotTypeVersions operation always returns at least one version,
       the $LATEST version.

       This operation requires permissions for the lex:GetSlotTypeVersions ac-
       tion.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-slot-type-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: slotTypes

SYNOPSIS
            get-slot-type-versions
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the slot type for which versions should be returned.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       slotTypes -> (list)
          An array of SlotTypeMetadata objects, one for each numbered  version
          of the slot type plus one for the $LATEST version.

          (structure)
              Provides information about a slot type..

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the slot type.

              description -> (string)
                 A description of the slot type.

              lastUpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  that  the slot type was updated. When you create a
                 resource, the creation date and last  updated  date  are  the
                 same.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that the slot type was created.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the slot type.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token for fetching the next page of slot type versions.
          If the response to this call is truncated, Amazon Lex returns a pag-
          ination  token  in the response. To fetch the next page of versions,
          specify the pagination token in the next request.
