NAME
       describe-db-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about DB snapshots. This API action supports pagi-
       nation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-snapshots is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  ID of the DB instance to retrieve the list of DB snapshots for.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB snapshot identifier to describe. This value is  stored
          as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBSnapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of snapshots to be returned. You can  specify  one  of  the
          following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB snapshots that have been automatically
            taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB snapshots that have been taken by my Amazon
            Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return all manual DB snapshots that have been shared to
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB snapshots that have been marked as public.

          o awsbackup - Return the DB snapshots managed by the Amazon Web Ser-
            vices  Backup  service.  For information about Amazon Web Services
            Backup, see the ` Amazon  Web  Services  Backup  Developer  Guide.
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/whatisbackup.html`__
            The awsbackup type does not apply to Aurora.

          If you don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both  automated  and
          manual  snapshots  are  returned. Shared and public DB snapshots are
          not included in the returned results by  default.  You  can  include
          shared  snapshots  with  these results by enabling the IncludeShared
          parameter. You can include public snapshots with  these  results  by
          enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB snapshots to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers and  DB  instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-snapshot-id - Accepts DB snapshot identifiers.

          o dbi-resource-id - Accepts identifiers of source DB instances.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether to include shared manual DB cluster
          snapshots from other Amazon Web Services accounts that  this  Amazon
          Web  Services  account has been given permission to copy or restore.
          By default, these snapshots are not included.

          You can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore  a
          manual DB snapshot from another Amazon Web Services account by using
          the ModifyDBSnapshotAttribute API action.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to include manual  DB  cluster  snap-
          shots  that  are  public and can be copied or restored by any Amazon
          Web Services account. By default, the public snapshots are  not  in-
          cluded.

          You can share a manual DB snapshot as public by using the  ModifyDB-
          SnapshotAttribute API.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          A specific DB resource ID to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Guide.

       Example 2: To find the number of manual snapshots taken

       The following describe-db-snapshots example uses the length operator in
       the --query option to return the number of manual snapshots  that  have
       been taken in a particular AWS Region.

          aws rds describe-db-snapshots \
              --snapshot-type manual \
              --query "length(*[].{DBSnapshots:SnapshotType})" \
              --region eu-central-1

       Output:

          35

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

                     For more information, see Configuring  the  Processor  of
                     the DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  processor feature. Valid names are
                        coreCount and threadsPerCore .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of a processor feature name.

              DbiResourceId -> (string)
                 The identifier for the source DB  instance,  which  can't  be
                 changed and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

              TagList -> (list)
                 A  list of tags. For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS
                 Resources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 (structure)
                     Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of
                     a key-value pair.

                     Key -> (string)
                        A  key  is  the  required  name of the tag. The string
                        value can be from  1  to  128  Unicode  characters  in
                        length  and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The
                        string can only contain only the set of  Unicode  let-
                        ters,  digits,  white-space,  '_', '.', ':', '/', '=',
                        '+',        '-',        '@'        (Java        regex:
                        "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                     Value -> (string)
                        A  value  is the optional value of the tag. The string
                        value can be from  1  to  256  Unicode  characters  in
                        length  and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The
                        string can only contain only the set of  Unicode  let-
                        ters,  digits,  white-space,  '_', '.', ':', '/', '=',
                        '+',        '-',        '@'        (Java        regex:
                        "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              OriginalSnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time of the CreateDBSnapshot operation in Coor-
                 dinated Universal Time (UTC). Doesn't change when  the  snap-
                 shot is copied.

              SnapshotDatabaseTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of the most recent transaction applied to the
                 database that you're backing up. Thus, if you restore a snap-
                 shot,  SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in
                 the restored DB instance. In  contrast,  originalSnapshotCre-
                 ateTime  specifies  the  system  time  that the snapshot com-
                 pleted.

                 If you back up a read replica, you can determine the  replica
                 lag  by  comparing  SnapshotDatabaseTime  with  originalSnap-
                 shotCreateTime. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime is
                 two  hours  later than SnapshotDatabaseTime, then the replica
                 lag is two hours.

              SnapshotTarget -> (string)
                 Specifies where manual snapshots are stored: Amazon Web  Ser-
                 vices Outposts or the Amazon Web Services Region.

              StorageThroughput -> (integer)
                 Specifies the storage throughput for the DB snapshot.
