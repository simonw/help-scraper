NAME
       describe-db-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available DB engines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-engine-versions  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DBEngineVersions

       --engine-version (string)
          The database engine version to return.

          Example: 5.1.49

       --db-parameter-group-family (string)
          The  name  of a specific DB parameter group family to return details
          for.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBParameterGroupFamily.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether only the default version of the spec-
          ified engine or engine and major version combination is returned.

       --list-supported-character-sets   |  --no-list-supported-character-sets
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to list the supported character  sets
          for each engine version.

          If  this  parameter is enabled and the requested engine supports the
          CharacterSetName parameter for CreateDBInstance , the  response  in-
          cludes a list of supported character sets for each engine version.

          For RDS Custom, the default is not to list supported character sets.
          If you set ListSupportedCharacterSets to true , RDS  Custom  returns
          no results.

       --list-supported-timezones | --no-list-supported-timezones (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to list the supported time zones for
          each engine version.

          If this parameter is enabled and the requested engine  supports  the
          TimeZone  parameter  for  CreateDBInstance , the response includes a
          list of supported time zones for each engine version.

          For RDS Custom, the default is not to list supported time zones.  If
          you  set  ListSupportedTimezones to true , RDS Custom returns no re-
          sults.

       --include-all | --no-include-all (boolean)
          A value that indicates  whether  to  include  engine  versions  that
          aren't  available in the list. The default is to list only available
          engine versions.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 To  determine the supported features for a specific DB engine
                 and DB engine version using the CLI, use the  following  com-
                 mand:
                     aws   rds   describe-db-engine-versions   --engine   <en-
                     gine_name> --engine-version <engine_version>

                 For example, to determine the supported features for RDS  for
                 PostgreSQL version 13.3 using the CLI, use the following com-
                 mand:
                     aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions  --engine  postgres
                     --engine-version 13.3

                 The supported features are listed under SupportedFeatureNames
                 in the output.

                 query with a specific DB engine version.

              SupportsGlobalDatabases -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether  you  can  use  Aurora  global
                 databases with a specific DB engine version.

                 The  name of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains your database
                 installation files.

                 The Amazon S3 directory that contains the database  installa-
                 tion files. If not specified, then no prefix is assumed.
