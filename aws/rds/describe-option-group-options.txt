NAME
       describe-option-group-options -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes all available options.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-option-group-options  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: OptionGroupOptions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-option-group-options
          --engine-name <value>
          [--major-engine-version <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --engine-name (string)
          A required parameter. Options available for the  given  engine  name
          are described.

          Valid Values:

          o mariadb

          o mysql

          o oracle-ee

          o oracle-ee-cdb

          o oracle-se2

          o oracle-se2-cdb

          o postgres

          o sqlserver-ee

          o sqlserver-se

          o sqlserver-ex

          o sqlserver-web

       --major-engine-version (string)
          If  specified,  filters  the results to include only options for the
          specified major engine version.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe all available options

       The  following  describe-option-group-options example lists two options
       for an Oracle Database 19c instance.

                 The options that conflict with this option.

                 (string)

              Persistent -> (boolean)
                 Persistent options can't be  removed  from  an  option  group
                 while  DB  instances are associated with the option group. If
                 you disassociate all DB instances from the option group, your
                 can remove the persistent option from the option group.

              Permanent -> (boolean)
                 Permanent  options can never be removed from an option group.
                 An option group containing a permanent option  can't  be  re-
                 moved from a DB instance.

              RequiresAutoMinorEngineVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
                 If  true, you must enable the Auto Minor Version Upgrade set-
                 ting for your DB instance before you can use this option. You
                 can  enable  Auto Minor Version Upgrade when you first create
                 your DB instance, or by modifying your DB instance later.

              VpcOnly -> (boolean)
                 If true, you can only use this option with a DB instance that
                 is in a VPC.

              SupportsOptionVersionDowngrade -> (boolean)
                 If  true,  you can change the option to an earlier version of

                 versions available.

              OptionGroupOptionSettings -> (list)
                 The  option  settings  that  are  available  (and the default
                 value) for each option in an option group.

                 (structure)
                     Option group option settings are used to display settings
                     available  for  each option with their default values and
                     other information. These values are  used  with  the  De-

                     IsModifiable -> (boolean)
                        Boolean  value  where  true indicates that this option
                        group option can be changed from the default value.

                     IsRequired -> (boolean)
                        Boolean value where true indicates that a  value  must
