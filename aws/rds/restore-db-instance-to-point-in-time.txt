RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()  RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a  DB instance to an arbitrary point in time. You can restore
       to  any  point  in  time  before  the  time  identified  by  the   Lat-
       estRestorableTime property. You can restore to a point up to the number
       of days specified by the BackupRetentionPeriod property.

       The target database is created with most of the original configuration,
       but  in  a system-selected Availability Zone, with the default security
       group, the default subnet group, and the default DB parameter group. By
       default,  the  new DB instance is created as a single-AZ deployment ex-
       cept when the instance is a SQL Server  instance  that  has  an  option
       group that is associated with mirroring; in this case, the instance be-
       comes a mirrored deployment and not a single-AZ deployment.

       NOTE:
          This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL  and  Aurora  PostgreSQL.
          For Aurora, use RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime .

          Valid  Values:  Value  must  be a time in Universal Coordinated Time
          (UTC) format

          Constraints:

          o Must be before the latest restorable time for the DB instance

          o Can't be specified if the UseLatestRestorableTime parameter is en-
            abled

          Example: 2009-09-07T23:45:00Z

       --use-latest-restorable-time  |  --no-use-latest-restorable-time (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is restored from  the
          latest  backup time. By default, the DB instance isn't restored from
          the latest backup time.

          Constraints: Can't be specified if the RestoreTime parameter is pro-
          vided.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  compute  and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB instance, for
          example db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes  are  available  in
          all  Amazon  Web  Services Regions, or for all database engines. For
          the full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your  en-
          gine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the database accepts connections.

          Constraints: Value must be 1150-65535

          Default: The same port as the original DB instance.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

          Constraint:  You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

          Example: us-east-1a

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The DB subnet group name to use for the new instance.

          Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing  DBSub-
          netGroup.

          Example: mydbsubnetgroup

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deploy-
          ment.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraint: You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if  the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessi-
          ble.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public  IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter is ultimately controlled by the security  group  it  uses.  That
          public  access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether minor version  upgrades  are  applied
          automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window.

              SQL Server

          Setting the IOPS value for the SQL Server database engine isn't sup-
          ported.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  option  group to be used for the restored DB in-
          stance.

          Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced  Secu-
          rity  TDE,  can't  be  removed from an option group, and that option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance  after  it  is  associated

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-de-
                fault value.

              additional storage for future growth.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates

                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular

                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

                     For more information, see Configuring  the  Processor  of

              Indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem (DNS) endpoint resolves  to  the  private  IP  address  from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to the public IP address from outside of the DB  cluster's  VPC.
              Access  to  the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the secu-
              rity group it uses. That public access isn't  permitted  if  the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an inter-
              nal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP
              address.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              The network type is determined by  the  DBSubnetGroup  specified
              for  the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the  Amazon  RDS  User Guide and Working with a DB instance in a

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active - The secret is available for normal use  and  rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired  -  The secret can be used to access database cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can no longer access either the secret or the KMS  key  for
                   the  secret. When a secret has this status, you can correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the  DB  instance to turn off automatic management of data-
                   base credentials, and then modify the DB instance again  to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.
