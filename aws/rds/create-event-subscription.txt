CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()                        CREATE-EVENT-SUBSCRIPTION()



NAME
       create-event-subscription -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an RDS event notification subscription. This operation requires
       a topic Amazon Resource Name (ARN) created by either the  RDS  console,
       the  SNS  console,  or the SNS API. To obtain an ARN with SNS, you must
       create a topic in Amazon SNS and subscribe to the  topic.  The  ARN  is
       displayed in the SNS console.

       You  can  specify  the type of source (SourceType ) that you want to be
       notified of and provide a list of RDS sources (SourceIds )  that  trig-
       gers  the  events.  You  can  also  provide  a list of event categories
       (EventCategories ) for events that you want to be notified of. For  ex-
       ample,  you  can specify SourceType = db-instance , SourceIds = mydbin-
       stance1 , mydbinstance2 and EventCategories = Availability , Backup .

       If you specify both the SourceType and SourceIds , such as SourceType =
       db-instance and SourceIds = myDBInstance1 , you are notified of all the
       db-instance events for the specified source. If you specify  a  Source-
       Type  but  do  not specify SourceIds , you receive notice of the events
       for that source type for all your RDS sources. If you don't specify ei-
       ther  the SourceType or the SourceIds , you are notified of events gen-
       erated from all RDS sources belonging to your customer account.

       NOTE:
          RDS event notification is only available for unencrypted SNS topics.
          If  you  specify  an encrypted SNS topic, event notifications aren't
          sent for the topic.

SYNOPSIS
            create-event-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --sns-topic-arn <value>
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--event-categories <value>]
          [--source-ids <value>]
          [--enabled | --no-enabled]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the subscription.

          Constraints: The name must be less than 255 characters.

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SNS topic  created  for  event
          notification.  The  ARN  is  created by Amazon SNS when you create a
          topic and subscribe to it.

       --source-type (string)
          The type of source that is generating the events.  For  example,  if
          you  want  to  be notified of events generated by a DB instance, you
          set this parameter to db-instance . For RDS  Proxy  events,  specify
          db-proxy . If this value isn't specified, all events are returned.

          Valid values: db-instance | db-cluster | db-parameter-group | db-se-
          curity-group | db-snapshot | db-cluster-snapshot | db-proxy

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories for a particular source type  (SourceType
          )  that  you  want  to subscribe to. You can see a list of the cate-
          gories for a given source type in the "Amazon RDS  event  categories
          and  event  messages"  section  of  the  `  Amazon  RDS  User  Guide
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html`__
          or       the       `       Amazon       Aurora       User      Guide
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/USER_Events.Messages.html`__
          .  You  can  also see this list by using the DescribeEventCategories
          operation.

       --source-ids (list)
          The list of identifiers of the event sources for  which  events  are
          returned. If not specified, then all sources are included in the re-
          sponse. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only
          ASCII  letters,  digits,  and hyphens. It can't end with a hyphen or
          contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --enabled | --no-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to activate the subscription. If the

          created but not active.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Re-

              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)

                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an event subscription

       The  following create-event-subscription example creates a subscription
       for backup and recovery events for DB instances in the current AWS  ac-
       count.  Notifications are sent to an Amazon Simple Notification Service
       topic, specified by --sns-topic-arn.

          aws rds create-event-subscription \
              --subscription-name my-instance-events \
              --source-type db-instance \
              --event-categories '["backup","recovery"]' \
              --sns-topic-arn arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events

       Output:

          {
              "EventSubscription": {
                  "Status": "creating",
                  "CustSubscriptionId": "my-instance-events",
                  "SubscriptionCreationTime": "Tue Jul 31 23:22:01 UTC 2018",
                  "EventCategoriesList": [
                      "backup",
                      "recovery"
                  ],
                  "SnsTopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:interesting-events",
                  "CustomerAwsId": "123456789012",
                  "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:es:my-instance-events",
                  "SourceType": "db-instance",
                  "Enabled": true
              }
          }

          scribeEventSubscriptions action.

          CustomerAwsId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services customer account associated with the RDS
              event notification subscription.
