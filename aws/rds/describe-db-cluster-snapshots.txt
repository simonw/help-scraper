NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB cluster snapshots. This API action sup-
       ports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For  more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-cluster-snapshots
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--snapshot-type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--include-public | --no-include-public]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  the DB cluster to retrieve the list of DB cluster snap-
          shots for. This parameter can't be used in conjunction with the  DB-
          ClusterSnapshotIdentifier  parameter. This parameter isn't case-sen-
          sitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This  parame-
          ter can't be used in conjunction with the DBClusterIdentifier param-
          eter. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an  existing  DBCluster-
            Snapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one
          of the following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been auto-
            matically taken by Amazon RDS for my Amazon Web Services account.

          o manual - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been  taken  by
            my Amazon Web Services account.

          o shared  -  Return  all  manual DB cluster snapshots that have been
            shared to my Amazon Web Services account.

          o public - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  DB
          cluster  snapshots  with these results by enabling the IncludeShared
          parameter. You can include public DB cluster  snapshots  with  these
          results by enabling the IncludePublic parameter.

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more  DB  cluster  snapshots  to  de-
          scribe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs).

          o db-cluster-snapshot-id - Accepts DB cluster snapshot identifiers.

          o snapshot-type - Accepts types of DB cluster snapshots.

          o engine - Accepts names of database engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to include shared manual  DB  cluster
          snapshots  from  other Amazon Web Services accounts that this Amazon
          Web Services account has been given permission to copy  or  restore.
          By default, these snapshots are not included.

          You  can give an Amazon Web Services account permission to restore a
          manual DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Services  account
          by the ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to include manual DB cluster snap-
          shots that are public and can be copied or restored  by  any  Amazon
          Web  Services  account. By default, the public snapshots are not in-
          cluded.

          You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public  by  using  the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       tails for the DB cluster snapshots for the specified DB cluster.
