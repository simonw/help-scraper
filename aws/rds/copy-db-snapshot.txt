COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()                                          COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies the specified DB snapshot. The source DB snapshot must be in the
       available state.

       You can copy a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Region to another.
       In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the CopyDB-
       Snapshot operation is the destination Amazon Web  Services  Region  for
       the DB snapshot copy.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       For more information about copying snapshots, see Copying a DB Snapshot
       in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-db-snapshot
          --source-db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--option-group-name <value>]
          [--target-custom-availability-zone <value>]
          [--source-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the source DB snapshot.

          If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
          the  copy,  specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. For example, you
          might specify rds:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services  Region
          than  the  copy,  specify  a valid DB snapshot ARN. For example, you
          might specify  arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-in-
          stance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If  you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter
          must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.

          If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must  be  in
          the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          Example: rds:mydb-2012-04-02-00-01

          Example:       arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-in-
          stance1-snapshot-20130805

       --target-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the copy of the snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be null, empty, or blank

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-db-snapshot

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB snap-
          shot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
          ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your Amazon  Web  Services
          account,  you  can specify a value for this parameter to encrypt the
          copy with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for  this  pa-
          rameter, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same
          Amazon Web Services KMS key as the source DB snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that  is  shared  from  another
          Amazon  Web Services account, then you must specify a value for this
          parameter.

          If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot,
          the copy is encrypted.

          If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different Amazon Web Services
          Region, then you must specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key identi-
          fier  for  the  destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are
          specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in,
          and  you  can't  use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags. For more information, see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS  Re-
          sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the  source  DB
          snapshot to the target DB snapshot. By default, tags are not copied.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When  you  are  copying a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Gov-
          Cloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Ver-
          sion  4  signed  request for the CopyDBSnapshot API operation in the
          source Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB  snap-
          shot to copy.

          This  setting  applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Re-
          gions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

          You must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB  snap-
          shot from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS
          API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are copying an encrypted DB
          snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnap-
          shot API operation that can run in the source  Amazon  Web  Services
          Region  that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy. The
          presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

          o DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region  that  the  en-
            crypted  DB snapshot is copied to. This Amazon Web Services Region
            is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot operation is called  that
            contains this presigned URL. For example, if you copy an encrypted
            DB snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region  to  the
            us-east-1  Amazon  Web  Services Region, then you call the CopyDB-
            Snapshot operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and
            provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot
            operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services  Region.  For  this
            example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to
            the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the KMS key to  use  to  en-
            crypt  the  copy  of the DB snapshot in the destination Amazon Web
            Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the  CopyDB-
            Snapshot  operation  that  is called in the destination Amazon Web
            Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.

          o SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier - The DB snapshot  identifier  for  the
            encrypted  snapshot  to  be copied. This identifier must be in the
            Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  Region.  For  example,  if  you are copying an encrypted DB
            snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then  your
            SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier   looks  like  the  following  example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snap-
            shot-20161115 .

          To  learn  how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  in-
              stead  of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRe-
              gion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid  request  for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The name of an option group to associate with the copy of the  snap-
          shot.

          Specify  this  option  if you are copying a snapshot from one Amazon
          Web Services Region to another, and your DB instance uses  a  nonde-
          fault option group. If your source DB instance uses Transparent Data
          Encryption for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, you must specify this
          option when copying across Amazon Web Services Regions. For more in-
          formation, see Option group considerations in the  Amazon  RDS  User
          Guide .

       --target-custom-availability-zone (string)
          The  external custom Availability Zone (CAZ) identifier for the tar-
          get CAZ.

          Example: rds-caz-aiqhTgQv .

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              the  DB  instance  class of the DB instance when the DB snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.
