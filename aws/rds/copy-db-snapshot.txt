COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()                                          COPY-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies the specified DB snapshot. The source DB snapshot must be in the
       available state.

       You can copy a snapshot from one Amazon Web Services Region to another.
       In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you call the CopyDB-
       Snapshot operation is the destination Amazon Web  Services  Region  for
       the DB snapshot copy.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       For more information about copying snapshots, see Copying a DB Snapshot
       in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --source-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the source DB snapshot.

          If the source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region  as
          the  copy,  specify a valid DB snapshot identifier. For example, you
          might specify rds:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web Services  Region
          than  the  copy,  specify  a valid DB snapshot ARN. For example, you
          might specify  arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-in-
          stance1-snapshot-20130805 .

          If  you are copying from a shared manual DB snapshot, this parameter
          must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the shared DB snapshot.

          If you are copying an encrypted snapshot this parameter must  be  in
          the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Region.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          Example: rds:mydb-2012-04-02-00-01

          Example:       arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-in-
          stance1-snapshot-20130805

       --target-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the copy of the snapshot.

          Constraints:

          o Can't be null, empty, or blank

          o Must contain from 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-db-snapshot

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB snap-
          shot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
          ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your Amazon  Web  Services
          account,  you  can specify a value for this parameter to encrypt the
          copy with a new KMS key. If you don't specify a value for  this  pa-
          rameter, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same
          Amazon Web Services KMS key as the source DB snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that  is  shared  from  another
          Amazon  Web Services account, then you must specify a value for this
          parameter.

          If you specify this parameter when you copy an unencrypted snapshot,
          the copy is encrypted.

          If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different Amazon Web Services
          Region, then you must specify an Amazon Web Services KMS key identi-
          fier  for  the  destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are
          specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in,
          and  you  can't  use KMS keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags. For more information, see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS  Re-
          sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS  Resources  in  the
              Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  copy all tags from the source DB snapshot to
          the target DB snapshot. By default, tags aren't copied.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When you are copying a snapshot from one Amazon  Web  Services  Gov-
          Cloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Ver-
          sion 4 signed request for the CopyDBSnapshot API  operation  in  the
          source  Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source DB snap-
          shot to copy.

          This setting applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud  (US)  Re-
          gions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

          You  must specify this parameter when you copy an encrypted DB snap-
          shot from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the Amazon RDS
          API. Don't specify PreSignedUrl when you are copying an encrypted DB
          snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnap-
          shot  API  operation  that can run in the source Amazon Web Services
          Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy.  The
          presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

          o DestinationRegion  -  The  Amazon Web Services Region that the en-
            crypted DB snapshot is copied to. This Amazon Web Services  Region
            is  the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot operation is called that
            contains this presigned URL. For example, if you copy an encrypted
            DB  snapshot  from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region to the
            us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region, then you  call  the  CopyDB-
            Snapshot operation in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and
            provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot
            operation  in  the  us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For this
            example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to
            the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId  -  The  KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to en-
            crypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the  destination  Amazon  Web
            Services  Region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDB-
            Snapshot operation that is called in the  destination  Amazon  Web
            Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.

          o SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier  -  The  DB snapshot identifier for the
            encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must  be  in  the
            Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Region. For example, if you  are  copying  an  encrypted  DB
            snapshot  from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region, then your
            SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier  looks  like  the  following   example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snap-
            shot-20161115 .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or --source-region for the CLI) in-
              stead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying  SourceRe-
              gion  autogenerates  a presigned URL that is a valid request for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The  name of an option group to associate with the copy of the snap-
          shot.

          Specify this option if you are copying a snapshot  from  one  Amazon
          Web  Services  Region to another, and your DB instance uses a nonde-
          fault option group. If your source DB instance uses Transparent Data
          Encryption for Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server, you must specify this
          option when copying across Amazon Web Services Regions. For more in-
          formation,  see  Option  group considerations in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide .

       --target-custom-availability-zone (string)
          The external custom Availability Zone (CAZ) identifier for the  tar-
          get CAZ.

          Example: rds-caz-aiqhTgQv .

       --copy-option-group | --no-copy-option-group (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  copy the DB option group associated with the
          source DB snapshot to the target Amazon Web Services account and as-
          sociate with the target DB snapshot. The associated option group can
          be copied only with cross-account snapshot copy calls.

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          DBSnapshotArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB snapshot.

          Timezone -> (string)
              The time zone of the DB snapshot. In most  cases,  the  Timezone
              element  is  empty.  Timezone content appears only for snapshots
              taken from Microsoft SQL Server DB instances that  were  created
              with a time zone specified.

          IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  mapping  of Amazon Web Services Identity and
              Access Management (IAM) accounts to  database  accounts  is  en-
              abled.

          ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
              The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for
              the DB instance class of the DB instance when  the  DB  snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per  core,  use  the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name
                 parameter.

                 You can set the processor features of the DB  instance  class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You  can view the valid processor values for a particular in-
                 stance class by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions  action and specifying the instance class for the DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In addition, you can use the following  actions  for  DB  in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The  current  number  CPU  cores  and  threads  is set to a
                   non-default value.

                 For more information, see Configuring the Processor of the DB
                 Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are core-
                     Count and threadsPerCore .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of a processor feature name.

          DbiResourceId -> (string)
              The identifier for  the  source  DB  instance,  which  can't  be
              changed and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

          TagList -> (list)
              A list of tags. For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Re-
              sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              (structure)
                 Metadata assigned to an Amazon RDS resource consisting  of  a
                 key-value pair.

                 For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Resources in the
                 Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A key is the required name of the tag. The  string  value
                     can  be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and
                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain   only   the  set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A  value  is  the  optional  value of the tag. The string
                     value can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters  in  length
                     and  can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can
                     only contain only the set  of  Unicode  letters,  digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          OriginalSnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time of the CreateDBSnapshot operation in  Coordi-
              nated  Universal Time (UTC). Doesn't change when the snapshot is
              copied.

          SnapshotDatabaseTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp of the most  recent  transaction  applied  to  the
              database  that  you're  backing up. Thus, if you restore a snap-
              shot, SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in the
              restored  DB  instance.  In contrast, originalSnapshotCreateTime
              specifies the system time that the snapshot completed.

              If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag
              by  comparing  SnapshotDatabaseTime with originalSnapshotCreate-
              Time. For example, if originalSnapshotCreateTime  is  two  hours
              later  than  SnapshotDatabaseTime,  then  the replica lag is two
              hours.

          SnapshotTarget -> (string)
              Specifies where manual snapshots are stored: Amazon Web Services
              Outposts or the Amazon Web Services Region.

          StorageThroughput -> (integer)
              Specifies the storage throughput for the DB snapshot.

          DBSystemId -> (string)
              The Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Or-
              acle database instance that manages your database files. The Or-
              acle SID is also the name of your CDB.

          DedicatedLogVolume -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  the  DB  instance has a dedicated log volume
              (DLV) enabled.

          MultiTenant -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether the snapshot is of a  DB  instance  using  the
              multi-tenant  configuration (TRUE) or the single-tenant configu-
              ration (FALSE).
