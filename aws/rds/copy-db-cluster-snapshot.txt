COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                          COPY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       copy-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Copies a snapshot of a DB cluster.

       To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

       You  can  copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web
       Services Region. In that case, the Amazon Web Services Region where you
       call  the CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation is the destination Amazon Web
       Services Region for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied  to.
       To  copy  an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Region, you must provide the following values:

       o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services Key Management System (Amazon  Web
         Services  KMS)  key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy
         of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Re-
         gion.

       o TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  -  The identifier for the new copy
         of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Re-
         gion.

       o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  -  The DB cluster snapshot identi-
         fier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to be copied. This identi-
         fier must be in the ARN format for the source Amazon Web Services Re-
         gion and is the same value as  the  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
         in the presigned URL.

       To  cancel the copy operation once it is in progress, delete the target
       DB cluster  snapshot  identified  by  TargetDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
       while that DB cluster snapshot is in "copying" status.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-db-cluster-snapshot
          --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--pre-signed-url <value>]
          [--copy-tags | --no-copy-tags]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--source-region <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter
          isn't case-sensitive.

          You can't copy an encrypted, shared DB  cluster  snapshot  from  one
          Amazon Web Services Region to another.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          o If  the  source snapshot is in the same Amazon Web Services Region
            as the copy, specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.

          o If the source snapshot is in a different Amazon Web  Services  Re-
            gion  than  the copy, specify a valid DB cluster snapshot ARN. For
            more information, go to Copying Snapshots Across Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices Regions in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  new DB cluster snapshot to create from the
          source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB clus-
          ter  snapshot. The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key
          ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the  Amazon  Web  Services
          KMS key.

          If  you  copy  an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon Web
          Services account, you can specify a value for  KmsKeyId  to  encrypt
          the  copy  with  a  new  KMS  key.  If you don't specify a value for
          KmsKeyId , then the copy of the DB  cluster  snapshot  is  encrypted
          with the same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from an-
          other Amazon Web Services account, then you must specify a value for
          KmsKeyId .

          To  copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot to another Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region, you must set KmsKeyId to the Amazon Web  Services  KMS
          key identifier you want to use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster
          snapshot in the destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are
          specific to the Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in,
          and you can't use KMS keys from one Amazon Web  Services  Region  in
          another Amazon Web Services Region.

          If  you  copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and specify a value
          for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When you are copying a DB cluster snapshot from one Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  GovCloud (US) Region to another, the URL that contains a Sig-
          nature Version 4 signed request for  the  CopyDBClusterSnapshot  API
          operation in the Amazon Web Services Region that contains the source
          DB cluster snapshot to copy. Use  the  PreSignedUrl  parameter  when
          copying  an  encrypted  DB  cluster snapshot from another Amazon Web
          Services Region. Don't specify  PreSignedUrl  when  copying  an  en-
          crypted DB cluster snapshot in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          This  setting  applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Re-
          gions. It's ignored in other Amazon Web Services Regions.

          The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBClusterSnap-
          shot  API  operation  that can run in the source Amazon Web Services
          Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to copy.  The
          presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:

          o KmsKeyId  -  The  KMS key identifier for the KMS key to use to en-
            crypt the copy of the DB cluster snapshot in the destination  Ama-
            zon  Web Services Region. This is the same identifier for both the
            CopyDBClusterSnapshot operation that is called in the  destination
            Amazon  Web  Services  Region,  and the operation contained in the
            presigned URL.

          o DestinationRegion - The name of the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
            that the DB cluster snapshot is to be created in.

          o SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  - The DB cluster snapshot iden-
            tifier for the encrypted DB cluster snapshot to  be  copied.  This
            identifier  must  be  in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for
            the source Amazon Web Services Region. For  example,  if  you  are
            copying an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 Amazon
            Web Services Region, then  your  SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
            looks          like         the         following         example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-clus-
            ter1-snapshot-20161115 .

          To  learn  how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed request, see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can specify SourceRegion (or --source-region for  the  CLI)  in-
              stead  of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying SourceRe-
              gion autogenerates a presigned URL that is a valid  request  for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the  source  DB
          cluster snapshot to the target DB cluster snapshot. By default, tags
          are not copied.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags. For more information, see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS  Re-
          sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
