DESCRIBE-DB-PROXIES()                                    DESCRIBE-DB-PROXIES()



NAME
       describe-db-proxies -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about DB proxies.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-proxies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBProxies

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy. If you omit this parameter, the output in-
          cludes  information  about  all  DB proxies owned by your Amazon Web
          Services account ID.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBRecommendations

              o DescribeDBShardGroups

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       DBProxies -> (list)
          A return value representing an  arbitrary  number  of  DBProxy  data
          structures.

          (structure)
              The  data  structure  representing  a  proxy  managed by the RDS
              Proxy.

              This data type  is  used  as  a  response  element  in  the  De-
              scribeDBProxies action.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the proxy. This name must be unique for
                 all proxies owned by your Amazon Web Services account in  the
                 specified Amazon Web Services Region.

              DBProxyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the proxy.

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this proxy. A status of available means
                 the proxy is ready to handle requests. Other values  indicate
                 that  you  must  wait for the proxy to be ready, or take some
                 action to resolve an issue.

              EngineFamily -> (string)
                 The kinds of databases that the proxy can  connect  to.  This
                 value  determines  which  database network protocol the proxy
                 recognizes when it interprets network traffic to and from the
                 database.  MYSQL  supports Aurora MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and
                 RDS for MySQL databases.  POSTGRESQL  supports  Aurora  Post-
                 greSQL  and  RDS for PostgreSQL databases. SQLSERVER supports
                 RDS for Microsoft SQL Server databases.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy.

              VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
                 Provides a list of VPC security groups that the proxy belongs
                 to.

                 (string)

              VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
                 The EC2 subnet IDs for the proxy.

                 (string)

              Auth -> (list)
                 One  or  more  data  structures  specifying the authorization
                 mechanism to connect to the associated RDS DB instance or Au-
                 rora DB cluster.

                 (structure)
                     Returns  the details of authentication used by a proxy to
                     log in as a specific database user.

                     Description -> (string)
                        A user-specified description about the  authentication
                        used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                     UserName -> (string)
                        The  name of the database user to which the proxy con-
                        nects.

                     AuthScheme -> (string)
                        The type of authentication that  the  proxy  uses  for
                        connections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                     SecretArn -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the secret
                        that the proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB  in-
                        stance  or Aurora DB cluster. These secrets are stored
                        within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                     IAMAuth -> (string)
                        Whether to require or  disallow  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Identity  and  Access  Management (IAM) authentication
                        for connections to the proxy.  The  ENABLED  value  is
                        valid  only  for  proxies  with  RDS for Microsoft SQL
                        Server.

                     ClientPasswordAuthType -> (string)
                        The type of authentication the proxy uses for  connec-
                        tions from clients.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  for the IAM role that the
                 proxy uses to access Amazon Secrets Manager.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint that you can use to connect to the DB proxy. You
                 include  the  endpoint  value  in the connection string for a
                 database client application.

              RequireTLS -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether Transport Layer Security  (TLS)  encryption
                 is required for connections to the proxy.

              IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  number  of seconds a connection to the proxy can have no
                 activity before the proxy drops the  client  connection.  The
                 proxy  keeps the underlying database connection open and puts
                 it back into the connection pool for reuse by  later  connec-
                 tion requests.

                 Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

                 Constraints: 1 to 28,800

              DebugLogging -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  proxy  includes detailed information
                 about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps  you
                 to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and
                 scalability of the proxy connections. The  debug  information
                 includes  the  text of SQL statements that you submit through
                 the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for de-
                 bugging, and only when you have security measures in place to
                 safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the proxy was first created.

              UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the proxy was last updated.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
