START-DB-CLUSTER()                                          START-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       start-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an  Amazon  Aurora DB cluster that was stopped using the Amazon
       Web Services console, the stop-db-cluster CLI command, or  the  StopDB-
       Cluster action.

       For  more  information,  see Stopping and Starting an Aurora Cluster in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-db-cluster
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the Amazon  Aurora  DB  cluster  to  be
          started. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  an  Amazon  Aurora  DB cluster, this data type is used as a re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  , Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3  ,  RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot  ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime , StartDBCluster ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster , De-
          scribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster  ,  RebootDB-
          Cluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is  Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deploy-
          ments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS  User
          Guide.

              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically  adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

                 DBClusterParameterGroupStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB  cluster  parameter  group
                     for this member of the DB cluster.

                 PromotionTier -> (integer)
                     A  value  that  specifies  the  order  in which an Aurora
                     Replica is promoted to the primary instance after a fail-

                 DB engine mode.

              AutoPause -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether automatic pause is allowed for
                 the Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine mode.

                 When the value is set to false for an Aurora Serverless v1 DB
                 cluster, the DB cluster automatically resumes.

              SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
                 The remaining amount of time, in seconds, before  the  Aurora
                 DB  cluster in serverless mode is paused. A DB cluster can be

                 pacityChange .
                     ForceApplyCapacityChange , the default, sets the capacity
                     to the specified value as soon as possible.

                     RollbackCapacityChange ignores the capacity change  if  a
                     scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
                 The  number of seconds before scaling times out. What happens
                 when an attempted scaling action times out is  determined  by
                 the TimeoutAction setting.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Indicates if the DB cluster has deletion protection enabled. The
              database can't be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.

              A value that indicates whether the HTTP endpoint for  an  Aurora
              Serverless v1 DB cluster is enabled.

              When  enabled,  the  HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web
              service API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless  v1
              DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS
              console with the query editor.

              less v1 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
              The  mode  of the database activity stream. Database events such
              as a change or access generate an  activity  stream  event.  The
              database session can handle these events either synchronously or
              asynchronously.

          ActivityStreamStatus -> (string)

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When  the  DB  instance  is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
              System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private  IP  address  from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It re-
              solves to the public IP address  from  outside  of  the  DB  in-
              stance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
              by the security group it uses. That public access is not permit-
              ted  if  the  security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't
              permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .
