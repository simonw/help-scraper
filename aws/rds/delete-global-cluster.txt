DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                DELETE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  global database cluster. The primary and secondary clusters
       must already be detached or destroyed first.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-global-cluster
          --global-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the global database cluster being deleted.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a global DB cluster

       The  following  delete-global-cluster   example   deletes   an   Aurora
       MySQL-compatible  global  DB cluster. The output shows the cluster that
       you're deleting, but subsequent describe-global-clusters commands don't
       list that DB cluster.

          aws rds delete-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalCluster": {
                  "GlobalClusterIdentifier": "myglobalcluster",
                  "GlobalClusterResourceId": "cluster-f0e523bfe07aabb",
                  "GlobalClusterArn": "arn:aws:rds::123456789012:global-cluster:myglobalcluster",
                  "Status": "available",
                  "Engine": "aurora-mysql",
                  "EngineVersion": "5.7.mysql_aurora.2.07.2",
                  "StorageEncrypted": false,
                  "DeletionProtection": false,
                  "GlobalClusterMembers": []
              }
          }

              The Aurora database engine used by the global database cluster.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Indicates the database engine version.

              The  default  database name within the new global database clus-
              ter.

                 GlobalWriteForwardingStatus -> (string)
                     Specifies whether a secondary cluster in an Aurora global
                     database has write forwarding enabled, not enabled, or is

                   (  GlobalCluster  )  has  been received by the service. The
                   GlobalCluster 's primary DB cluster and the specified  sec-
                   ondary  DB  cluster  are being verified before the failover
                   process can start.

                 o failing-over  This status covers the range of Aurora inter-
                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such as demoting the primary Aurora DB  cluster,  promoting
                   the secondary Aurora DB, and synchronizing replicas.

                 o cancelling   The  request  to  fail  over the Aurora global
                   database ( GlobalCluster ) was cancelled  and  the  primary
                   Aurora  DB  cluster  and  the  selected secondary Aurora DB
                   cluster are returning to their previous states.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Aurora DB cluster  that
                 is  currently  being  promoted,  and which is associated with
                 this state.
