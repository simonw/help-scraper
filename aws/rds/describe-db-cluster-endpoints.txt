NAME
       describe-db-cluster-endpoints -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about endpoints for an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-endpoints  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterEndpoints

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-cluster-endpoints
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--db-cluster-endpoint-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with the end-
          point. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the endpoint to describe. This parameter is stored
          as a lowercase string.

       --filters (list)
          A set of name-value pairs that define which endpoints to include  in
          the  output.  The  filters are specified as name-value pairs, in the
          format    Name=*endpoint_type*    ,Values=*endpoint_type1*    ,*end-
          point_type2*  ,...  . Name can be one of: db-cluster-endpoint-type ,
          db-cluster-endpoint-custom-type , db-cluster-endpoint-id ,  db-clus-
          ter-endpoint-status . Values for the db-cluster-endpoint-type filter
          can be one or more of: reader , writer , custom  .  Values  for  the
          db-cluster-endpoint-custom-type filter can be one or more of: reader
          , any . Values for the db-cluster-endpoint-status filter can be  one
          or more of: available , creating , deleting , inactive , modifying .

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To describe DB cluster endpoints

       The following describe-db-cluster-endpoints example  retrieves  details
       for your DB cluster endpoints. The most common kinds of Aurora clusters
       have two endpoints. One endpoint has type WRITER. You can use this end-
       point  for  all SQL statements. The other endpoint has type READER. You
       can use this endpoint only for SELECT and other  read-only  SQL  state-
       ments.

          aws rds describe-db-cluster-endpoints

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterEndpoints": [
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "my-database-1",
                      "Endpoint": "my-database-1.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "creating",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "my-database-1",
                      "Endpoint": "my-database-1.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "creating",
                      "EndpointType": "READER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
                      "Endpoint": "mydbcluster.cluster-cnpexamle.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "available",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  },
                  {
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
                      "Endpoint": "mydbcluster.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "Status": "available",
                      "EndpointType": "READER"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To describe DB cluster endpoints of a single DB cluster

       The  following  describe-db-cluster-endpoints example retrieves details
       for the DB cluster endpoints of a single specified DB  cluster.  Aurora
       Serverless clusters have only a single endpoint with a type of WRITER.

          aws rds describe-db-cluster-endpoints \
              --db-cluster-identifier serverless-cluster

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterEndpoints": [
                  {
                      "Status": "available",
                      "Endpoint": "serverless-cluster.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                      "DBClusterIdentifier": "serverless-cluster",
                      "EndpointType": "WRITER"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous  DescribeDBClus-
          terEndpoints  request.  If this parameter is specified, the response
          includes only records beyond the marker, up to the  value  specified
          by MaxRecords .

       DBClusterEndpoints -> (list)
          Contains  the  details  of the endpoints associated with the cluster
          and matching any filter conditions.

          (structure)
              This data type represents the information you need to connect to
              an  Amazon  Aurora  DB  cluster. This data type is used as a re-
              sponse element in the following actions:

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o ModifyDBClusterEndpoint

              o DeleteDBClusterEndpoint

              For the data structure that represents Amazon  RDS  DB  instance
              endpoints, see Endpoint .

              DBClusterEndpointIdentifier -> (string)
                 The  identifier  associated with the endpoint. This parameter
                 is stored as a lowercase string.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster  associated  with
                 the endpoint. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

              DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 A  unique system-generated identifier for an endpoint. It re-
                 mains the same for the whole life of the endpoint.

                 The current status of the endpoint. One of: creating , avail-
                 able  ,  deleting , inactive , modifying . The inactive state
                 applies to an endpoint that can't be used for a certain  kind
                 of  cluster,  such  as a writer endpoint for a read-only sec-
                 ondary cluster in a global database.

              EndpointType -> (string)
                 The type of the endpoint. One of: READER , WRITER , CUSTOM .

              StaticMembers -> (list)
                 List  of  DB instance identifiers that are part of the custom
                 endpoint group.

                 (string)

              ExcludedMembers -> (list)
                 List of DB instance identifiers that aren't part of the  cus-
                 tom  endpoint  group. All other eligible instances are reach-
                 able through the custom endpoint. Only relevant if  the  list
                 of static members is empty.

                 (string)

              DBClusterEndpointArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the endpoint.
