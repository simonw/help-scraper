CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB cluster.

       You can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create an Ama-
       zon Aurora DB cluster as a read replica of another DB cluster or Amazon
       RDS MySQL or PostgreSQL DB instance. For cross-Region replication where
       the DB cluster identified by ReplicationSourceIdentifier is  encrypted,
       also specify the PreSignedUrl parameter.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ  deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The  Multi-AZ  DB  clusters  feature is in preview and is subject to
          change.

              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB clus-
          ter.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.

          When a KMS key isn't specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If  ReplicationSourceIdentifier  identifies  an  encrypted source,
            then Amazon RDS will use the KMS key used to encrypt  the  source.
            Otherwise, Amazon RDS will use your default KMS key.

          o If  the StorageEncrypted parameter is enabled and ReplicationSour-
            ceIdentifier isn't specified, then Amazon RDS will  use  your  de-
            fault KMS key.

          There  is  a  default  KMS key for your Amazon Web Services account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

          If  you  create a read replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another
          Amazon Web Services Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS key iden-
          tifier  that is valid in the destination Amazon Web Services Region.
          This KMS key is used to encrypt the read replica in that Amazon  Web
          Services Region.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          A  URL  that  contains  a Signature Version 4 signed request for the
          CreateDBCluster action to be called in the source  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  Region  where the DB cluster is replicated from. Specify Pre-
          SignedUrl only when you are performing cross-Region replication from
          an encrypted DB cluster.

          The  pre-signed  URL must be a valid request for the CreateDBCluster
          API action that can be executed in the source  Amazon  Web  Services
          Region that contains the encrypted DB cluster to be copied.

          The pre-signed URL request must contain the following parameter val-
          ues:

          o KmsKeyId - The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for the  KMS
            key  to  use to encrypt the copy of the DB cluster in the destina-
            tion Amazon Web Services Region. This should refer to the same KMS
            key for both the CreateDBCluster action that is called in the des-
            tination Amazon Web Services Region, and the action  contained  in
            the pre-signed URL.

          o DestinationRegion  -  The  name  of the Amazon Web Services Region
            that Aurora read replica will be created in.

          o ReplicationSourceIdentifier - The DB cluster  identifier  for  the
            encrypted  DB cluster to be copied. This identifier must be in the
            Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon  Web  Ser-
            vices  Region.  For  example,  if  you are copying an encrypted DB
            cluster from the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region,  then  your
            ReplicationSourceIdentifier     would     look    like    Example:
            arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster:aurora-cluster1 .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or --source-region for the CLI) in-
              stead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying  SourceRe-
              gion  autogenerates a pre-signed URL that is a valid request for
              the operation that can be executed in the source Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Region.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
          counts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

          For more information, see IAM Database Authentication in the  Amazon
          Aurora User Guide.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --backtrack-window (long)
          The  target  backtrack  window, in seconds. To disable backtracking,
          set this value to 0.

          Default: 0

          Constraints:

          o If specified, this value must be set to a number from 0 to 259,200
            (72 hours).

          Valid for: Aurora MySQL DB clusters only

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The  list  of  log  types  that  need to be enabled for exporting to
          CloudWatch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine  be-
          ing used. For more information, see Publishing Database Logs to Ama-
          zon CloudWatch Logs in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .
              Aurora MySQL

          Possible values are audit , error , general , and slowquery .

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --engine-mode (string)
          The DB engine mode of the DB cluster, either provisioned  ,  server-
          less , parallelquery , global , or multimaster .

          The  parallelquery  engine mode isn't required for Aurora MySQL ver-
          sion 1.23 and higher 1.x versions, and version 2.09 and  higher  2.x
          versions.

          The  global engine mode isn't required for Aurora MySQL version 1.22
          and higher 1.x versions, and global engine mode isn't  required  for
          any 2.x versions.

          The  multimaster  engine  mode  only applies for DB clusters created
          with Aurora MySQL version 5.6.10a.

          For Aurora PostgreSQL, the global engine mode  isn't  required,  and
          both  the  parallelquery  and the multimaster engine modes currently
          aren't supported.

          Limitations and requirements apply to some DB engine modes. For more
          information,  see  the  following sections in the Amazon Aurora User
          Guide :

          o Limitations of Aurora Serverless

          of the DB cluster.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

          MinCapacity -> (integer)
              The  minimum  capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For  Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 , 16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The minimum capacity must be less than or equal to  the  maximum
              capacity.

          MaxCapacity -> (integer)
              The  maximum  capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For  Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 , 16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the  mini-
              mum capacity.

          AutoPause -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  indicates whether to allow or disallow automatic
              pause for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine  mode.  A
              DB  cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connec-
              tions).

              NOTE:
                 If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven  days,  the  DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect  to
                 it.

          SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
              The  time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in serverless
              mode is paused.

              Specify a value between 300 and 86,400 seconds.

          TimeoutAction -> (string)
              The action to take when the timeout is reached, either  ForceAp-
              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange  sets  the capacity to the specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange , the default,  ignores  the  capacity
                 change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  ForceApplyCapacityChange , connections that
                 prevent Aurora Serverless from finding a scaling point  might
                 be dropped.

              For  more  information, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless tries  to
              find  a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before enforc-
              ing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=integer,MaxCapacity=integer,AutoPause=boolean,SecondsUntilAutoPause=integer,TimeoutAction=string,SecondsBeforeTimeout=integer

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The global cluster ID of an Aurora cluster that becomes the  primary
          cluster in the new global database cluster.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-http-endpoint | --no-enable-http-endpoint (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to enable the HTTP endpoint for an
          Aurora Serverless DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint is  dis-
          abled.

          When  enabled,  the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web ser-
          vice API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless  DB  clus-
          ter.  You  can  also query your database from inside the RDS console
          with the query editor.

          For more information, see Using the Data API for  Aurora  Serverless
          in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB cluster
          to snapshots of the DB cluster. The default is not to copy them.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB cluster in.

          For Amazon Aurora DB clusters, Amazon RDS can use Kerberos authenti-
          cation to authenticate users that connect to the DB cluster.

          For  more information, see Kerberos authentication in the Amazon Au-
          rora User Guide .

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to
          the Directory Service.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --enable-global-write-forwarding  | --no-enable-global-write-forwarding
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable this DB cluster to  forward
          write operations to the primary cluster of an Aurora global database
          ( GlobalCluster ). By default, write operations are not  allowed  on
          Aurora  DB  clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global
          database.

          You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that  are  members
          of  an  Aurora  global database. With this parameter enabled, a sec-
          ondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster and
          the  resulting  changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the
          primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is  used
          immediately  if the primary is demoted by the  FailoverGlobalCluster
          API operation, but it does nothing until then.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --db-cluster-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the  Multi-AZ
          DB  cluster,  for example db.m6g.xlarge. Not all DB instance classes
          are available in all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for  all  data-
          base engines.

          For  the  full list of DB instance classes and availability for your
          engine, see DB instance class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate to each DB  in-
          stance in the Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB cluster.

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Valid values: io1

          When specified, a value for the Iops parameter is required.

          Default: io1

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --iops (integer)
          The  amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second)
          to be initially allocated for each DB instance in  the  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  information about valid Iops values, see Amazon RDS Provisioned
          IOPS storage to improve performance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting is required to create a Multi-AZ DB cluster.

          Constraints: Must be a multiple between .5 and  50  of  the  storage
          amount for the DB cluster.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether the DB cluster is publicly accessi-
          ble.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public  IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter is ultimately controlled by the security  group  it  uses.  That
          public  access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB cluster isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal  DB
          cluster with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default:  The default behavior varies depending on whether DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If DBSubnetGroupName isn't specified, and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If the default VPC in the target Region has  an  internet  gateway
            attached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC  that  doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB cluster is private.

          o If  the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway at-
            tached to it, the DB cluster is public.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied au-
          tomatically to the DB cluster during the maintenance window. By  de-
          fault, minor engine upgrades are applied automatically.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB cluster. To turn off collecting En-
          hanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If  MonitoringRoleArn is specified, also set MonitoringInterval to a
          value other than 0.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the IAM role that permits RDS  to
          send Enhanced Monitoring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. An exam-
          ple is arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For  information  on
          creating  a  monitoring  role,  see Setting up and enabling Enhanced
          Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Moni-
          toringRoleArn value.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether to turn on Performance  Insights  for
          the DB cluster.

          For  more  information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId ,  then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The  amount  of  time, in days, to retain Performance Insights data.
          Valid values are 7 or 731 (2 years).

          Valid for: Multi-AZ DB clusters only

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a MySQL 5.7--compatible DB cluster

       The following create-db-cluster example create a  MySQL  5.7-compatible
       DB  cluster.  Replace  the sample password secret99 with a secure pass-
       word. The writer DB instance is the first instance that is created in a
       DB cluster. When you use the console to create a DB cluster, Amazon RDS
       automatically creates the writer DB instance for your DB cluster.  How-
       ever, when you use the AWS CLI to create a DB cluster, you must explic-
       itly create the writer DB instance for your DB cluster using  the  cre-

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains  the  details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ DB
          cluster.

          For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type is  used  as  a  re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  ,  Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDBCluster  ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment in the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,  De-
          scribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , RebootDB-
          Cluster ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For  more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  deploy-
          ments  with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide.

              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically  adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)

              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

              Specifies  whether you have requested to enable write forwarding
              for a secondary cluster in an Aurora  global  database.  Because
              write  forwarding takes time to enable, check the value of Glob-
              alWriteForwardingStatus to confirm that  the  request  has  com-
              pleted  before using the write forwarding feature for this clus-

                 LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of  being  deactivated.
                     After  they  are  deactivated, these log types aren't ex-
                     ported to CloudWatch Logs.

                     (string)

                 LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of being enabled. After
                     they  are enabled, these log types are exported to Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

                     (string)

                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
                 counts is enabled.

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The database engine version.

          DBClusterInstanceClass -> (string)
              The name of the compute and memory capacity class of the DB  in-
              stance.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          StorageType -> (string)
              The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When  the  DB  instance  is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
              System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private  IP  address  from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It re-
              solves to the public IP address  from  outside  of  the  DB  in-
              stance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
              by the security group it uses. That public access is not permit-
              ted  if  the  security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't
              permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Moni-
              toring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
