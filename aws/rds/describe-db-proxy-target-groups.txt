NAME
       describe-db-proxy-target-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB  proxy  target  groups,  represented by
       DBProxyTargetGroup data structures.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-proxy-target-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: TargetGroups

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxy associated with the target group.

       --target-group-name (string)
          The identifier of the DBProxyTargetGroup to describe.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       TargetGroups -> (list)
          An  arbitrary  number  of DBProxyTargetGroup objects, containing de-
          tails of the corresponding target groups.

          (structure)
              Represents a set of RDS DB instances,  Aurora  DB  clusters,  or
              both  that  a proxy can connect to. Currently, each target group
              is associated with exactly one RDS  DB  instance  or  Aurora  DB
              cluster.

              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  element  in the De-
              scribeDBProxyTargetGroups action.

              DBProxyName -> (string)
                 The identifier for the RDS proxy associated with this  target
                 group.

              TargetGroupName -> (string)
                 The identifier for the target group. This name must be unique
                 for all target groups owned by your Amazon Web  Services  ac-
                 count in the specified Amazon Web Services Region.

              TargetGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the target group.

              IsDefault -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether this target group is the first one used for
                 connection requests by the  associated  proxy.  Because  each
                 proxy  is  currently  associated  with a single target group,
                 currently this setting is always true .

              Status -> (string)
                 The current status of this target group. A status  of  avail-
                 able  means  the  target group is correctly associated with a
                 database. Other values indicate that you must  wait  for  the
                 target  group  to be ready, or take some action to resolve an
                 issue.

              ConnectionPoolConfig -> (structure)
                 The settings that determine the size and behavior of the con-
                 nection pool for the target group.

                 MaxConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                     The  maximum  size of the connection pool for each target
                     in a target group. The value is expressed as a percentage
                     of the max_connections setting for the RDS DB instance or
                     Aurora DB cluster used by the target group.

                 MaxIdleConnectionsPercent -> (integer)
                     Controls how actively the proxy closes idle database con-
                     nections  in  the connection pool. The value is expressed
                     as a percentage of the max_connections  setting  for  the
                     RDS  DB  instance or Aurora DB cluster used by the target
                     group. With a high value, the proxy leaves  a  high  per-
                     centage  of  idle  database connections open. A low value
                     causes the proxy to close more idle connections  and  re-
                     turn them to the database.

                 ConnectionBorrowTimeout -> (integer)
                     The  number  of seconds for a proxy to wait for a connec-
                     tion to become available in the connection pool. Only ap-
                     plies  when  the  proxy  has opened its maximum number of
                     connections and all connections are busy with client ses-
                     sions.

                 SessionPinningFilters -> (list)
                     Each  item  in  the list represents a class of SQL opera-
                     tions that normally cause all later statements in a  ses-
                     sion  using  a  proxy to be pinned to the same underlying
                     database connection. Including an item in  the  list  ex-
                     empts  that  class of SQL operations from the pinning be-
                     havior. This setting is only supported for  MySQL  engine
                     family  databases.  Currently,  the only allowed value is
                     EXCLUDE_VARIABLE_SETS .

                     (string)

                 InitQuery -> (string)
                     One or more SQL statements for  the  proxy  to  run  when
                     opening each new database connection. Typically used with
                     SET statements to make  sure  that  each  connection  has
                     identical  settings  such as time zone and character set.
                     This setting is empty by  default.  For  multiple  state-
                     ments,  use semicolons as the separator. You can also in-
                     clude multiple variables in a single SET statement,  such
                     as SET x=1, y=2 .

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the target group was first created.

              UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the target group was last updated.

       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .
