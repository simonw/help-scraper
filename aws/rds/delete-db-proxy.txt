OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,

OUTPUT
       DBProxy -> (structure)
          The data structure representing the details of the DB proxy that you
          delete.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The  identifier  for the proxy. This name must be unique for all

              The  current  status  of this proxy. A status of available means
              the proxy is ready to handle  requests.  Other  values  indicate

              determines  which database network protocol the proxy recognizes
              when it interprets network traffic to  and  from  the  database.
              MYSQL  supports Aurora MySQL, RDS for MariaDB, and RDS for MySQL
              databases. POSTGRESQL supports Aurora  PostgreSQL  and  RDS  for

              Server databases.

              to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)

              One  or more data structures specifying the authorization mecha-
              nism to connect to the associated RDS DB instance or  Aurora  DB
              cluster.

              (structure)
                 Returns  the details of authentication used by a proxy to log
                 in as a specific database user.

                 Description -> (string)
                     A user-specified  description  about  the  authentication
                     used by a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

                 UserName -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  database user to which the proxy con-
                     nects.

                 AuthScheme -> (string)
                     The type of authentication that the proxy uses  for  con-
                     nections from the proxy to the underlying database.

                 SecretArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) representing the secret
                     that the proxy uses to authenticate to  the  RDS  DB  in-
                     stance  or  Aurora  DB  cluster. These secrets are stored
                     within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                 IAMAuth -> (string)
                     Whether to require or disallow Amazon Web Services  Iden-
                     tity  and Access Management (IAM) authentication for con-
                     nections to the proxy. The ENABLED value  is  valid  only

              required for connections to the proxy.

          IdleClientTimeout -> (integer)
              The  number of seconds a connection to the proxy can have no ac-
              tivity before the proxy drops the client connection.  The  proxy
              keeps  the  underlying database connection open and puts it back
              into the connection pool for reuse by later connection requests.

              Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

              Constraints: 1 to 28,800

          DebugLogging -> (boolean)
              Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL state-
              ments  in  its  logs. This information helps you to debug issues
              involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the
              proxy  connections.  The  debug information includes the text of
              SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only en-
              able  this  setting when needed for debugging, and only when you
              have security measures in place to safeguard any  sensitive  in-
              formation that appears in the logs.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was last updated.
