CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()                                CREATE-GLOBAL-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  Aurora  global  database spread across multiple Amazon Web
       Services Regions. The global database contains a single primary cluster
       with  read-write capability, and a read-only secondary cluster that re-
       ceives data from the primary  cluster  through  high-speed  replication
       performed by the Aurora storage subsystem.

       You  can create a global database that is initially empty, and then add
       a primary cluster and a secondary cluster to it. Or you can specify  an
       existing  Aurora  cluster during the create operation, and this cluster
       becomes the primary cluster of the global database.

       NOTE:
          This action applies only to Aurora DB clusters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-global-cluster
          [--global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--source-db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--engine <value>]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--database-name <value>]
          [--storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The cluster identifier of the new global database cluster.

       --source-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to use as the primary cluster of  the
          global database. This parameter is optional.

       --engine (string)
          The name of the database engine to be used for this DB cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version of the Aurora global database.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          The  deletion  protection  setting  for the new global database. The
          global database can't be deleted when  deletion  protection  is  en-
          abled.

       --database-name (string)
          The  name  for your database of up to 64 alphanumeric characters. If
          you do not provide a name, Amazon Aurora will not create a  database
          in the global database cluster you are creating.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          The storage encryption setting for the new global database cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                   nal operations that take place during the failover process,
                   such  as  demoting the primary Aurora DB cluster, promoting
                   the secondary Aurora DB, and synchronizing replicas.

                 is currently being promoted, and  which  is  associated  with
                 this state.
