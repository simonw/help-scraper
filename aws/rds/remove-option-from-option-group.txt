SYNOPSIS
            remove-option-from-option-group
          --option-group-name <value>
          [--apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately]
          [--options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --option-group-name (string)
          The name of the option group to be modified.

          Permanent  options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced Secu-
          rity TDE, can't be removed from an option  group,  and  that  option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance once it is associated with
          a DB instance

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to apply the  change  immediately  or
          during the next maintenance window for each instance associated with
          the option group.

       --options (list)
          Options in this list are removed from the option group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete an option from an option group

       The  following  remove-option-from-option-group example removes the OEM
       option from myoptiongroup.

          aws rds remove-option-from-option-group \
              --option-group-name myoptiongroup \
              --options OEM \
              --apply-immediately

       Output:

          {
              "OptionGroup": {
                  "OptionGroupName": "myoptiongroup",
                  "OptionGroupDescription": "Test",
                  "EngineName": "oracle-ee",
                  "MajorEngineVersion": "19",
                  "Options": [],
                  "AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships": true,
                  "OptionGroupArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:og:myoptiongroup"
              }
          }
