DESCRIBE-OPTION-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-OPTION-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-option-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the available option groups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-option-groups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: OptionGroupsList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-option-groups
          [--option-group-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--engine-name <value>]
          [--major-engine-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --option-group-name (string)
          The name of the option group to describe. Can't be supplied together
          with EngineName or MajorEngineVersion.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --engine-name (string)
          Filters  the list of option groups to only include groups associated
          with a specific database engine.

          Valid Values:

          o mariadb

          o mysql

          o oracle-ee

          o oracle-ee-cdb

          o oracle-se2

          o oracle-se2-cdb

          o postgres

          o sqlserver-ee

          o sqlserver-se

          o sqlserver-ex

          o sqlserver-web

       --major-engine-version (string)
          Filters the list of option groups to only include groups  associated
          with  a specific database engine version. If specified, then Engine-
          Name must also be specified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe the available option groups

       The  following  describe-option-groups example lists the options groups
       for an Oracle Database 19c instance.

          aws rds describe-option-groups \
              --engine-name oracle-ee \
              --major-engine-version 19

       Output:

          {
              "OptionGroupsList": [
                  {
                      "OptionGroupName": "default:oracle-ee-19",
                      "OptionGroupDescription": "Default option group for oracle-ee 19",
                      "EngineName": "oracle-ee",
                      "MajorEngineVersion": "19",
                      "Options": [],
                      "AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships": true,
                      "OptionGroupArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-1:111122223333:og:default:oracle-ee-19"
                  }
              ]
          }

                        (structure)
                            This  data  type is used as a response element for
                            queries on VPC security group membership.

                            VpcSecurityGroupId -> (string)

                 Indicates  whether  this  option group can be applied to both
                 VPC and non-VPC instances. The value true indicates  the  op-
                 tion group can be applied to both VPC and non-VPC instances.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 If  AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships  is  false  ,  this
                 field is blank. If  AllowsVpcAndNonVpcInstanceMemberships  is
                 true  and  this field is blank, then this option group can be
                 applied to both VPC and non-VPC instances. If this field con-
                 tains  a value, then this option group can only be applied to
                 instances that are in the VPC indicated by this field.
