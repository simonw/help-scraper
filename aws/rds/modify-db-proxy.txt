OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-name (string)
          The identifier for the DBProxy to modify.

       --new-db-proxy-name (string)
          The new identifier for the DBProxy . An identifier must begin with a
          letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens;  it
          can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --auth (list)
          The new authentication settings for the DBProxy .

          (structure)
              Specifies  the  details of authentication used by a proxy to log
              in as a specific database user.

              Description -> (string)
                 A user-specified description about the authentication used by
                 a proxy to log in as a specific database user.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The name of the database user to which the proxy connects.

              AuthScheme -> (string)
                 The  type  of  authentication that the proxy uses for connec-
                 tions from the proxy to the underlying database.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) representing the  secret  that
                 the  proxy uses to authenticate to the RDS DB instance or Au-
                 rora DB cluster. These secrets are stored within  Amazon  Se-
                 crets Manager.

              IAMAuth -> (string)
                 Whether  to  require or disallow Amazon Web Services Identity
                 and Access Management (IAM) authentication for connections to
                 the proxy.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Description=string,UserName=string,AuthScheme=string,SecretArn=string,IAMAuth=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Description": "string",
              "UserName": "string",
              "AuthScheme": "SECRETS",
              "SecretArn": "string",
              "IAMAuth": "DISABLED"|"REQUIRED"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --require-tls | --no-require-tls (boolean)
          Whether  Transport  Layer  Security (TLS) encryption is required for
          connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can  enforce
          encrypted TLS connections to the proxy, even if the associated data-
          base doesn't use TLS.

       --idle-client-timeout (integer)
          The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive
          before  the  proxy  disconnects it. You can set this value higher or
          lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.

       --debug-logging | --no-debug-logging (boolean)
          Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements
          in  its  logs.  This information helps you to debug issues involving
          SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connec-
          tions.  The  debug  information  includes the text of SQL statements
          that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only  enable  this  setting
          when  needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures
          in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in  the
          logs.

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses
          to access secrets in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

       --security-groups (list)
          The new list of security groups for the DBProxy .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                     within Amazon Secrets Manager.

                 IAMAuth -> (string)
                     Whether  to require or disallow Amazon Web Services Iden-
                     tity and Access Management (IAM) authentication for  con-

              tivity before the proxy drops the client connection.  The  proxy
              keeps  the  underlying database connection open and puts it back
              into the connection pool for reuse by later connection requests.

              Default: 1800 (30 minutes)

              Constraints: 1 to 28,800

              proxy  connections.  The  debug information includes the text of
              SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only en-
              able  this  setting when needed for debugging, and only when you
              have security measures in place to safeguard any  sensitive  in-
              formation that appears in the logs.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the proxy was first created.

          UpdatedDate -> (timestamp)
