CREATE-DB-INSTANCE()                                      CREATE-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       create-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB instance.

       The  new  DB  instance can be an RDS DB instance, or it can be a DB in-
       stance in an Aurora DB cluster. For an Aurora DB cluster, you can  call
       this  operation  multiple times to add more than one DB instance to the
       cluster.

       For more information about creating an RDS DB instance, see Creating an
       Amazon RDS DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       For more information about creating a DB instance in an Aurora DB clus-
       ter, see Creating an Amazon Aurora DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User
       Guide .

       --nchar-character-set-name (string)
          The name of the NCHAR character set for the Oracle DB instance.

          This parameter doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB  in-
          stance  is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses. That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          Default: The default behavior varies depending on whether  DBSubnet-
          GroupName is specified.

          If  DBSubnetGroupName  isn't specified, and PubliclyAccessible isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If the default VPC in the target Region doesnt  have  an  internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If  the  default  VPC in the target Region has an internet gateway
            attached to it, the DB instance is public.

          If DBSubnetGroupName  is  specified,  and  PubliclyAccessible  isn't
          specified, the following applies:

          o If  the  subnets  are  part  of a VPC that doesnt have an internet
            gateway attached to it, the DB instance is private.

          o If the subnets are part of a VPC that has an internet gateway  at-
            tached to it, the DB instance is public.

       --tags (list)
          Tags to assign to the DB instance.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS  Resources  in  the
              Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 ':',    '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A value is the optional value of the tag.  The  string  value
                 can  be  from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length and can't
                 be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can  only  contain
                 only  the  set  of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',
                 '.',  ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java   regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB in-
          stance.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent Amazon Web Services account, specify the  key  ARN  or  alias
          ARN.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable.  The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is man-
          aged by the DB cluster. For more information, see CreateDBCluster .

          If StorageEncrypted is enabled, and you do not specify a  value  for
          the  KmsKeyId  parameter, then Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key.
          There is a default KMS key for your  Amazon  Web  Services  account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.
              Amazon RDS Custom

          A KMS key is required for RDS Custom instances.  For  most  RDS  en-
          gines,  if  you leave this parameter empty while enabling StorageEn-
          crypted , the engine uses the default KMS key. However,  RDS  Custom
          doesn't  use  the default key when this parameter is empty. You must
          explicitly specify a key.

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently,  only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB

          snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB clus-
          ter.  Setting  this value for an Aurora DB instance has no effect on
          the DB cluster setting.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The interval, in seconds, between points  when  Enhanced  Monitoring
          metrics  are collected for the DB instance. To disable collection of
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, then you must  set  MonitoringIn-
          terval to a value other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating

          Not applicable.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use  the  coreCount  feature
              name  for  the  Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
              per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the  Name  pa-
              rameter.

              You  can set the processor features of the DB instance class for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

          A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
          (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

          A  CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in your
          Outpost subnets through  your  on-premises  network.  For  some  use
          cases,  a  CoIP  can provide lower latency for connections to the DB
          instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your lo-
          cal network.

          For  more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  instance  profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 in-

          the following requirements:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions
            to assume.

          o The instance profile name and the associated IAM  role  name  must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

          Specifies where automated backups and manual snapshots are stored.

          Possible values are outposts (Amazon Web Services Outposts) and  re-
          gion (Amazon Web Services Region). The default is region .

          For more information, see Working with Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          Valid values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The network type is determined by the  DBSubnetGroup  specified  for
          the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

          This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

              DB  instance,  the  Aurora  MySQL DB cluster for the Aurora read
              replica is shown. This output doesn't contain information  about
              cross-Region Aurora read replicas.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one Aurora read

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.
