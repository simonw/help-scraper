NAME
       create-custom-db-engine-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  custom  DB  engine  version (CEV). A CEV is a binary volume
       snapshot of a database engine and specific AMI. The only supported  en-
       gine is Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition with the January 2021 or
       later RU/RUR.

       Amazon RDS, which is a fully managed service, supplies the  Amazon  Ma-
       chine  Image (AMI) and database software. The Amazon RDS database soft-
       ware is preinstalled, so you need only select a DB engine and  version,
       and create your database. With Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle, you upload
       your database installation files in Amazon S3.

       When you create a custom engine version, you specify  the  files  in  a
       JSON  document called a CEV manifest. This document describes installa-
       tion .zip files stored in Amazon S3. RDS Custom creates your  CEV  from
       the  installation files that you provided. This service model is called
       Bring Your Own Media (BYOM).

       Creation takes approximately two hours. If creation fails,  RDS  Custom
       issues  RDS-EVENT-0196  with the message Creation failed for custom en-
       gine version , and includes details about the failure. For example, the
       event prints missing files.

       After  you create the CEV, it is available for use. You can create mul-
       tiple CEVs, and create multiple RDS Custom instances from any CEV.  You
       can also change the status of a CEV to make it available or inactive.

       NOTE:
          The  MediaImport service that imports files from Amazon S3 to create
          CEVs isn't integrated with Amazon Web Services  CloudTrail.  If  you
          turn on data logging for Amazon RDS in CloudTrail, calls to the Cre-
          ateCustomDbEngineVersion event aren't logged. However, you might see
          calls  from  the  API  gateway  that accesses your Amazon S3 bucket.
          These calls originate from the MediaImport service for  the  Create-
          CustomDbEngineVersion event.

       For more information, see Creating a CEV in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for your custom engine version (CEV). The
          only supported value is custom-oracle-ee .

       --engine-version (string)
          The name of your CEV. The name format is 19.*customized_string* `` .
          For example, a valid name is ``19.my_cev1 . This setting is required
          for RDS Custom for Oracle, but optional for Amazon RDS. The combina-
          tion of Engine and EngineVersion is unique per customer per Region.

       --database-installation-files-s3-bucket-name (string)
          The  name of an Amazon S3 bucket that contains database installation
          files for your CEV. For example, a  valid  bucket  name  is  my-cus-
          tom-installation-files .

       --database-installation-files-s3-prefix (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  directory  that  contains the database installation
          files  for  your  CEV.  For  example,  a  valid   bucket   name   is
          123456789012/cev1  .  If  this setting isn't specified, no prefix is
          assumed.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for an encrypted  CEV.  A
          symmetric  KMS key is required for RDS Custom, but optional for Ama-
          zon RDS.

          If you have an existing symmetric KMS key in your account,  you  can
          use it with RDS Custom. No further action is necessary. If you don't
          already have a symmetric KMS key in your  account,  follow  the  in-
          structions in Creating symmetric KMS keys in the Amazon Web Services
          Key Management Service Developer Guide .

          You can choose the same symmetric key when you create a CEV and a DB
          instance, or choose different keys.

       --description (string)
          An optional description of your CEV.

       --manifest (string)
          The  CEV  manifest,  which is a JSON document that describes the in-
          stallation .zip files stored in Amazon S3.  Specify  the  name/value
          pairs  in  a file or a quoted string. RDS Custom applies the patches
          in the order in which they are listed.

          The following JSON fields are valid:
              MediaImportTemplateVersion

          Version of the CEV manifest. The date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD .
              databaseInstallationFileNames

          Ordered list of installation files for the CEV.
              opatchFileNames

          Ordered list of OPatch installers used for the Oracle DB engine.
              psuRuPatchFileNames

          The PSU and RU patches for this CEV.
              OtherPatchFileNames

          The patches that are not in the list of PSU and RU  patches.  Amazon
          RDS applies these patches after applying the PSU and RU patches.

          For  more  information,  see Creating the CEV manifest in the Amazon
          RDS User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags. For more information, see  Tagging  Amazon  RDS  Re-
          sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned  to  an  Amazon  RDS resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
