DELETE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUP()    DELETE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUP()



NAME
       delete-db-instance-automated-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  automated  backups using the DbiResourceId value of the source
       DB instance or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the automated backups.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-instance-automated-backup
          [--dbi-resource-id <value>]
          [--db-instance-automated-backups-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          The identifier for the source DB instance, which  can't  be  changed
          and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

       --db-instance-automated-backups-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the automated backups to delete,
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEX-
          AMPLE .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following delete-db-instance-automated-backup example  deletes  the
       automated backup with the specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN).
