NAME
       modify-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  manual  DB snapshot with a new engine version. The snapshot
       can be encrypted or unencrypted, but not shared or public.

       Amazon RDS supports upgrading DB snapshots for MySQL,  PostgreSQL,  and
       Oracle. This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

OPTIONS
       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB snapshot to modify.

       --engine-version (string)
          The engine version to upgrade the DB snapshot to.

          The  following are the database engines and engine versions that are
          available when you upgrade a DB snapshot.
              MySQL

          o 5.5.46 (supported for 5.1 DB snapshots)
              Oracle

          o 19.0.0.0.ru-2022-01.rur-2022-01.r1  (supported  for  12.2.0.1   DB
            snapshots)

          o 19.0.0.0.ru-2022-07.rur-2022-07.r1   (supported  for  12.1.0.2  DB
            snapshots)

          o 12.1.0.2.v8 (supported for 12.1.0.1 DB snapshots)

          o 11.2.0.4.v12 (supported for 11.2.0.2 DB snapshots)

          o 11.2.0.4.v11 (supported for 11.2.0.3 DB snapshots)
              PostgreSQL

          For the list of engine versions that are available for  upgrading  a
          DB snapshot, see Upgrading the PostgreSQL DB Engine for Amazon RDS .

       --option-group-name (string)
          The option group to identify with the upgraded DB snapshot.

          You  can  specify this parameter when you upgrade an Oracle DB snap-
          shot. The same option group considerations apply when upgrading a DB
          snapshot  as when upgrading a DB instance. For more information, see
          Option group considerations in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a DB snapshot

       The following modify-db-snapshot  example  upgrades  a  PostgeSQL  10.6
       snapshot named db5-snapshot-upg-test to PostgreSQL 11.7. The new DB en-
       gine version is shown after the snapshot has finished upgrading and its
       status is available.

          aws rds modify-db-snapshot \
              --db-snapshot-identifier db5-snapshot-upg-test \
              --engine-version 11.7

          ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
              The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per  core  for
              the  DB  instance  class of the DB instance when the DB snapshot
              was created.

              (structure)
                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                 o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 In  addition,  you  can  use the following actions for DB in-
                 stance class processor information:

                 o DescribeDBInstances

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

                 For more information, see Configuring the Processor of the DB
                 Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of the processor feature. Valid names are  core-
                     Count and threadsPerCore .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of a processor feature name.

          DbiResourceId -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  source  DB  instance,  which can't be
              changed and which is unique to an Amazon Web Services Region.

          TagList -> (list)
              A list of tags. For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Re-
              sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              (structure)
                 Metadata  assigned  to an Amazon RDS resource consisting of a
                 key-value pair.

                 For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Resources in the
                 Amazon RDS User Guide.

                 Key -> (string)
                     A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value
                     can be from 1 to 128 Unicode  characters  in  length  and
                     can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only
                     contain  only  the  set  of  Unicode   letters,   digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value is the optional value  of  the  tag.  The  string
                     value  can  be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length
                     and can't be prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string  can
                     only  contain  only  the  set of Unicode letters, digits,
                     white-space, '_', '.', ':', '/', '=', '+', '-', '@' (Java
                     regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

          OriginalSnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the time of the CreateDBSnapshot operation in Coordi-
              nated Universal Time (UTC). Doesn't change when the snapshot  is
              copied.

          SnapshotDatabaseTime -> (timestamp)
              The  timestamp  of  the  most  recent transaction applied to the
              database that you're backing up. Thus, if you  restore  a  snap-
              shot, SnapshotDatabaseTime is the most recent transaction in the
              restored DB instance.  In  contrast,  originalSnapshotCreateTime
              specifies the system time that the snapshot completed.

              If you back up a read replica, you can determine the replica lag
              by comparing SnapshotDatabaseTime  with  originalSnapshotCreate-
              Time.  For  example,  if originalSnapshotCreateTime is two hours
              later than SnapshotDatabaseTime, then the  replica  lag  is  two
              hours.

          SnapshotTarget -> (string)
              Specifies where manual snapshots are stored: Amazon Web Services
              Outposts or the Amazon Web Services Region.

          StorageThroughput -> (integer)
              Specifies the storage throughput for the DB snapshot.

          DBSystemId -> (string)
              The Oracle system identifier (SID), which is the name of the Or-
              acle database instance that manages your database files. The Or-
              acle SID is also the name of your CDB.
