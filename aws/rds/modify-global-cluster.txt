NAME
       modify-global-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify  a  setting  for an Amazon Aurora global cluster. You can change
       one or more database configuration parameters by specifying  these  pa-
       rameters  and  the  new  values in the request. For more information on
       Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in  the  Amazon  Aurora  User
       Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-global-cluster
          [--global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--new-global-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection]
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier  for the global cluster being modified.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing global database cluster.

       --new-global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The new cluster identifier for the global database cluster when mod-
          ifying  a  global database cluster. This value is stored as a lower-
          case string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens

          o The first character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          Example: my-cluster2

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          Indicates if the global database cluster has deletion protection en-
          abled.  The  global  database cluster can't be deleted when deletion
          protection is enabled.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the database engine to which you want  to  up-
          grade.  Changing  this parameter results in an outage. The change is
          applied during the next maintenance window  unless  ApplyImmediately
          is enabled.

          To  list  all of the available engine versions for aurora (for MySQL
          5.6-compatible Aurora), use the following command:
              aws  rds  describe-db-engine-versions  --engine  aurora  --query
              '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases == `true`].[EngineVersion]'

          To  list  all of the available engine versions for aurora-mysql (for
          MySQL 5.7-compatible and MySQL 8.0-compatible Aurora), use the  fol-
          lowing command:
              aws   rds   describe-db-engine-versions   --engine  aurora-mysql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

          To list all of the available engine versions for aurora-postgresql ,
          use the following command:
              aws rds describe-db-engine-versions  --engine  aurora-postgresql
              --query  '*[]|[?SupportsGlobalDatabases  ==  `true`].[EngineVer-
              sion]'

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether major version upgrades are allowed.

          Constraints: You must allow major version upgrades when specifying a
          value for the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major ver-
          sion than the DB cluster's current version.

          If  you  upgrade the major version of a global database, the cluster
          and DB instance parameter groups are set to  the  default  parameter
          groups  for the new version. Apply any custom parameter groups after
          completing the upgrade.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a global DB cluster

       The following modify-global-cluster example enables deletion protection
       for an Aurora MySQL-compatible global DB cluster.

          aws rds modify-global-cluster \
              --global-cluster-identifier myglobalcluster \
              --deletion-protection

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalCluster": {
                  "GlobalClusterIdentifier": "myglobalcluster",
                  "GlobalClusterResourceId": "cluster-f0e523bfe07aabb",
