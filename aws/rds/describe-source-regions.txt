DESCRIBE-SOURCE-REGIONS()                            DESCRIBE-SOURCE-REGIONS()



NAME
       describe-source-regions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the source Amazon Web Services Regions where the cur-
       rent Amazon Web Services Region can create a read replica,  copy  a  DB
       snapshot  from,  or  replicate  automated backups from. This API action
       supports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-source-regions is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: SourceRegions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-source-regions
          [--region-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --region-name (string)
          The source Amazon Web Services Region name. For example, us-east-1 .

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid Amazon Web Services Region name.

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe source Regions

       The  following  describe-source-regions example retrieves details about
       all of the source AWS Regions. It also shows that automated backups can
       be replicated only from US West (Oregon) to the destination AWS Region,
       US East (N. Virginia).

          aws rds describe-source-regions \
              --region us-east-1

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous request. If this
          parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records  beyond
          the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       SourceRegions -> (list)
          A  list  of  SourceRegion instances that contains each source Amazon
          Web Services Region that the current Amazon Web Services Region  can
          get a read replica or a DB snapshot from.

          (structure)
              Contains  an  Amazon Web Services Region name as the result of a
              successful call to the DescribeSourceRegions action.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The name of the source Amazon Web Services Region.

              Endpoint -> (string)
                 The endpoint for the source Amazon Web Services  Region  end-
                 point.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the source Amazon Web Services Region.

              SupportsDBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplication -> (boolean)
                 Whether the source Amazon Web Services Region supports repli-
                 cating automated backups to the current Amazon  Web  Services
                 Region.
