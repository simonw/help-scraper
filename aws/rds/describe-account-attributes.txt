DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()                    DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       describe-account-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all of the attributes for a customer account. The attributes in-
       clude Amazon RDS quotas for the account, such as the number of  DB  in-
       stances  allowed.  The description for a quota includes the quota name,
       current usage toward that quota, and the quota's maximum value.

       This command doesn't take any parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-attributes
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccountQuotas -> (list)
          A list of AccountQuota objects. Within this list, each quota  has  a
          name, a count of usage toward the quota maximum, and a maximum value
          for the quota.

          (structure)
              Describes a quota for an Amazon Web Services account.

              The following are account quotas:

              o AllocatedStorage - The total allocated storage per account, in
                GiB.  The used value is the total allocated storage in the ac-

                per DB security group. The used value is the highest number of
                ingress rules in a DB security group in the account. Other  DB
                security  groups  in  the account might have a lower number of
                ingress rules.

              o CustomEndpointsPerDBCluster - The number of  custom  endpoints
                per DB cluster. The used value is the highest number of custom
                endpoints in a DB clusters in the account. Other  DB  clusters
                in the account might have a lower number of custom endpoints.

              o DBClusterParameterGroups  - The number of DB cluster parameter
                groups per account, excluding default  parameter  groups.  The
                used  value  is  the  count of nondefault DB cluster parameter
                groups in the account.

              o DBClusterRoles - The number of associated Amazon Web  Services
                Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles per DB cluster. The
                used value is the highest number of associated IAM roles for a
                DB  cluster  in  the account. Other DB clusters in the account
                might have a lower number of associated IAM roles.

              o DBClusters - The number of DB clusters per account.  The  used
                value is the count of DB clusters in the account.

              o DBInstanceRoles  -  The  number of associated IAM roles per DB
                instance. The used value is the highest number  of  associated
                IAM roles for a DB instance in the account. Other DB instances
                in the account might have a lower  number  of  associated  IAM
                roles.

              o DBInstances - The number of DB instances per account. The used
                value is the count of the DB instances in the account.  Amazon
                RDS  DB  instances, Amazon Aurora DB instances, Amazon Neptune
                instances, and  Amazon  DocumentDB  instances  apply  to  this
                quota.

              o DBParameterGroups  - The number of DB parameter groups per ac-
                count, excluding default parameter groups. The used  value  is
                the count of nondefault DB parameter groups in the account.

              o DBSecurityGroups  -  The number of DB security groups (not VPC
                security groups) per account, excluding the  default  security
                group.  The  used value is the count of nondefault DB security
                groups in the account.

              o DBSubnetGroups - The number of DB subnet groups  per  account.
                The used value is the count of the DB subnet groups in the ac-
                count.

                stance.  The used value is the highest number of read replicas
                for a DB instance in the account. Other DB  instances  in  the
                account might have a lower number of read replicas.

              o ReservedDBInstances  - The number of reserved DB instances per
                account. The used value is the count of the active reserved DB
                instances in the account.

              o SubnetsPerDBSubnetGroup  - The number of subnets per DB subnet
                group. The used value is highest number of subnets  for  a  DB
                subnet group in the account. Other DB subnet groups in the ac-
                count might have a lower number of subnets.
