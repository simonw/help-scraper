MODIFY-DB-SUBNET-GROUP()                              MODIFY-DB-SUBNET-GROUP()



NAME
       modify-db-subnet-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  an existing DB subnet group. DB subnet groups must contain at
       least one subnet in at least two AZs in the Amazon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-subnet-group
          --db-subnet-group-name <value>
          [--db-subnet-group-description <value>]
          --subnet-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name for the DB subnet group. This value is stored as  a  lower-
          case string. You can't modify the default subnet group.

          Constraints:  Must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup. Must
          not be default.

          Example: mySubnetgroup

       --db-subnet-group-description (string)
          The description for the DB subnet group.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB subnet group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To modify a DB subnet group

       The  following modify-db-subnet-group example adds a subnet with the ID
       subnet-08e41f9e230222222 to the DB subnet group named mysubnetgroup. To
       keep  the  existing  subnets  in the subnet group, include their IDs as
       values in the --subnet-ids option. Make sure to have  subnets  with  at
       least two different Availability Zones in the DB subnet group.

          aws rds modify-db-subnet-group \
              --db-subnet-group-name mysubnetgroup \
              --subnet-ids '["subnet-0a1dc4e1a6f123456","subnet-070dd7ecb3aaaaaaa","subnet-00f5b198bc0abcdef","subnet-08e41f9e230222222"]'
