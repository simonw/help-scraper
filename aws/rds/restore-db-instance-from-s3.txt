NAME
       restore-db-instance-from-s3 -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Relational  Database  Service  (Amazon  RDS) supports importing
       MySQL databases by using backup files. You can create a backup of  your
       on-premises database, store it on Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon
       S3), and then restore the backup file onto a new Amazon RDS DB instance
       running  MySQL. For more information, see Importing Data into an Amazon
       RDS MySQL DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       This command doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          ble.

          When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address  from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB in-
          stance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses.  That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For  more information about this setting, including limitations that
          apply to it, see Managing capacity  automatically  with  Amazon  RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified for
          the DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4  protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the

              Contains one or more identifiers of Aurora DB clusters to  which
              the  RDS  DB instance is replicated as a read replica. For exam-
              ple, when you create an Aurora read replica of an RDS for  MySQL
              DB  instance,  the  Aurora  MySQL DB cluster for the Aurora read
              replica is shown. This output doesn't contain information  about
              cross-Region Aurora read replicas.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one Aurora read
                 replica.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

          AwsBackupRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point  in  Amazon
              Web Services Backup.

          ActivityStreamStatus -> (string)
              The status of the database activity stream.

          ActivityStreamKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier used for encrypting
              messages in the database activity stream. The  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  KMS  key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or
              alias name for the KMS key.

          ActivityStreamKinesisStreamName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream used for the database
              activity stream.

          ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
              The  mode  of the database activity stream. Database events such
              as a change or access generate an activity stream event. RDS for
              Oracle always handles these events asynchronously.

          ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether engine-native audit fields are included in the
              database activity stream.

          AutomationMode -> (string)
              The automation mode of the RDS Custom DB instance: full  or  all
              paused  . If full , the DB instance automates monitoring and in-
              stance recovery. If all paused , the instance pauses  automation
              for the duration set by --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes .

          ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
              The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time pe-
              riod ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value
              is 60 (default). The maximum value is 1,440.

          CustomIamInstanceProfile -> (string)
              The  instance  profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2
              instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must
              meet the following requirements:

              o The profile must exist in your account.

              o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permis-
                sions to assume.

              o The instance profile name and the  associated  IAM  role  name
                must start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

              For  the  list  of  permissions  required  for the IAM role, see
              Configure IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          BackupTarget -> (string)
              Specifies where  automated  backups  and  manual  snapshots  are
              stored:  Amazon Web Services Outposts or the Amazon Web Services
              Region.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              Valid values:

              o IPV4

              o DUAL

              The network type is determined by  the  DBSubnetGroup  specified
              for  the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              the  Amazon  RDS  User Guide and Working with a DB instance in a
              VPC in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.
