DESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPSDESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPS()



NAME
       describe-db-instance-automated-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  backups  for both current and deleted instances. For example,
       use this operation to find details about automated backups  for  previ-
       ously  deleted  instances.  Current  instances  with  retention periods
       greater than zero (0) are returned for both the DescribeDBInstanceAuto-
       matedBackups and DescribeDBInstances operations.

       All parameters are optional.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-instance-automated-backups is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: DBInstanceAutomatedBackups

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-instance-automated-backups
          [--dbi-resource-id <value>]
          [--db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--db-instance-automated-backups-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dbi-resource-id (string)
          The resource ID of the DB instance that is the source of  the  auto-
          mated backup. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          (Optional)  The user-supplied instance identifier. If this parameter
          is specified, it must match the identifier of  an  existing  DB  in-
          stance.  It returns information from the specific DB instance' auto-
          mated backup. This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies which resources to return based on status.

          Supported filters are the following:

          o status

            o active - automated backups for current instances

            o retained - automated backups for  deleted  instances  and  after
              backup replication is stopped

            o creating  - automated backups that are waiting for the first au-
              tomated snapshot to be available

          o db-instance-id - Accepts DB instance identifiers  and  Amazon  Re-
            source  Names  (ARNs).  The results list includes only information
            about the DB instance automated backups identified by these ARNs.

          o dbi-resource-id - Accepts DB resource identifiers and  Amazon  Re-
            source  Names  (ARNs).  The results list includes only information
            about the DB instance resources identified by these ARNs.

          Returns all resources by default. The status for  each  resource  is
          specified in the response.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-instance-automated-backups-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replicated automated backups,
          for                                                         example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:auto-backup:ab-L2IJCEXJP7XQ7HOJ4SIEX-
          AMPLE .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
