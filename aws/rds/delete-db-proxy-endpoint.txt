DELETE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()                          DELETE-DB-PROXY-ENDPOINT()



NAME
       delete-db-proxy-endpoint -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a DBProxyEndpoint . Doing so removes the ability to access the
       DB proxy using the endpoint that you defined.  The  endpoint  that  you
       delete might have provided capabilities such as read/write or read-only
       operations, or using a different VPC than the DB proxy's default VPC.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-proxy-endpoint
          --db-proxy-endpoint-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-proxy-endpoint-name (string)
          The name of the DB proxy endpoint to delete.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBProxyEndpoint -> (structure)
          The data structure representing the details of the DB proxy endpoint
          that you delete.

          DBProxyEndpointName -> (string)
              The name for the DB proxy endpoint.  An  identifier  must  begin
              with  a  letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and
              hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain  two  consecutive
              hyphens.

          DBProxyEndpointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB proxy endpoint.

          DBProxyName -> (string)
              The  identifier for the DB proxy that is associated with this DB
              proxy endpoint.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of this DB proxy endpoint. A status of avail-
              able  means the endpoint is ready to handle requests. Other val-
              ues indicate that you must wait for the endpoint to be ready, or
              take some action to resolve an issue.

          VpcId -> (string)
              Provides the VPC ID of the DB proxy endpoint.

          VpcSecurityGroupIds -> (list)
              Provides  a  list  of VPC security groups that the DB proxy end-
              point belongs to.

              (string)

          VpcSubnetIds -> (list)
              The EC2 subnet IDs for the DB proxy endpoint.

              (string)

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The endpoint that you can use to connect to the  DB  proxy.  You
              include  the endpoint value in the connection string for a data-
              base client application.

          CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the DB proxy endpoint was first created.

          TargetRole -> (string)
              A value that indicates whether the DB proxy endpoint can be used
              for read/write or read-only operations.

          IsDefault -> (boolean)
              A value that indicates whether this endpoint is the default end-
              point for the associated DB proxy. Default  DB  proxy  endpoints
              always  have read/write capability. Other endpoints that you as-
              sociate with the DB proxy can be either read/write or read-only.
