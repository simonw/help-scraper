NAME
       modify-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  settings  for a DB instance. You can change one or more data-
       base configuration parameters by specifying these  parameters  and  the
       new  values in the request. To learn what modifications you can make to
       your DB instance, call DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications before  you
       call ModifyDBInstance .

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance  identifier.  This  value is stored as a lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The new amount of storage in gibibytes (GiB) to allocate for the  DB
          instance.

          For  MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value supplied must
          be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values that are  not
          at  least 10% greater than the existing value are rounded up so that
          they are 10% greater than the current value.

          For the valid values for allocated storage for each engine, see Cre-
          ateDBInstance .

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The  new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example
          db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
          Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list
          of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB In-
          stance  Class  in  the  Amazon  RDS User Guide or Aurora DB instance
          classes in the Amazon Aurora User Guide . For RDS Custom, see DB in-
          stance class support for RDS Custom for Oracle and DB instance class
          support for RDS Custom for SQL Server .

          If you modify the DB instance class, an  outage  occurs  during  the
          change.  The  change  is applied during the next maintenance window,
          unless you specify ApplyImmediately in your request.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this param-
          eter  to  move  your  DB instance to a different VPC. If your DB in-
          stance isn't in a VPC, you can also use this parameter to move  your
          DB  instance into a VPC. For more information, see Working with a DB
          instance in a VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Changing the subnet group causes an outage during  the  change.  The
          change is applied during the next maintenance window, unless you en-
          able ApplyImmediately .

          This parameter doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints: If supplied, must match the name of an existing  DBSub-
          netGroup.

          Example: mydbsubnetgroup

       --db-security-groups (list)
          A  list  of  DB  security  groups  to authorize on this DB instance.
          Changing this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change  is
          asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing DBSecurityGroups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to authorize on this DB in-
          stance. This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The associated list of EC2 VPC  security  groups  is
          managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster
          .

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing VpcSecurityGroupIds.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the modifications in this request and
          any pending modifications are asynchronously applied as soon as pos-
          sible, regardless of the PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for  the
          DB instance. By default, this parameter is disabled.

          If  this  parameter  is disabled, changes to the DB instance are ap-
          plied during the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes can
          cause  an  outage  and  are applied on the next call to  RebootDBIn-
          stance , or the next failure reboot. Review the table of  parameters
          in  Modifying  a DB Instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide to see the
          impact of enabling or disabling ApplyImmediately for  each  modified
          parameter and to determine when the changes are applied.

       --master-user-password (string)
          The  new  password for the master user. The password can include any
          printable ASCII character except "/", """, or "@".

          Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage and  the  change
          is  asynchronously  applied as soon as possible. Between the time of
          the request and the completion of the request,  the  MasterUserPass-
          word  element exists in the PendingModifiedValues element of the op-
          eration response.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The password for the master user is managed  by  the
          DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster .

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints:  Can't  be  specified  if  ManageMasterUserPassword  is
          turned on.
              MariaDB

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              Microsoft SQL Server

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.
              MySQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 41 characters.
              Oracle

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 30 characters.
              PostgreSQL

          Constraints: Must contain from 8 to 128 characters.

          NOTE:
              Amazon RDS API operations never return the password, so this ac-
              tion  provides a way to regain access to a primary instance user
              if the password is lost. This includes restoring privileges that
              might have been accidentally revoked.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB parameter group to apply to the DB instance.

          Changing  this  setting  doesn't  result in an outage. The parameter
          group name itself is changed immediately, but the  actual  parameter
          changes  are  not  applied  until  you  reboot  the instance without
          failover. In this case, the DB  instance  isn't  rebooted  automati-
          cally,  and  the  parameter  changes  aren't applied during the next
          maintenance window. However, if you modify dynamic parameters in the
          newly associated DB parameter group, these changes are applied imme-
          diately without a reboot.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter
          group family as the DB instance.

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain automated backups. Setting this parame-
          ter to a positive number enables backups. Setting this parameter  to
          0 disables automated backups.

          NOTE:
              Enabling and disabling backups can result in a brief I/O suspen-
              sion that lasts from a few seconds to a few  minutes,  depending
              on the size and class of your DB instance.

          These  changes are applied during the next maintenance window unless
          the ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request.  If  you
          change  the  parameter  from  one non-zero value to another non-zero
          value, the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups  is  man-
          aged by the DB cluster. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster .

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints:

          o It  must  be  a value from 0 to 35. It can't be set to 0 if the DB
            instance is a source to read replicas. It can't be set to 0 for an
            RDS Custom for Oracle DB instance.

          o It can be specified for a MySQL read replica only if the source is
            running MySQL 5.6 or later.

          o It can be specified for a PostgreSQL  read  replica  only  if  the
            source is running PostgreSQL 9.3.5.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily  time range during which automated backups are created if
          automated backups are enabled, as determined by the BackupRetention-
          Period  parameter. Changing this parameter doesn't result in an out-
          age and the change is asynchronously applied as  soon  as  possible.
          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. For more informa-
          tion, see Backup window in the Amazon RDS User Guide.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not  applicable. The daily time range for creating automated backups
          is managed by the DB cluster. For more  information,  see  ModifyDB-
          Cluster .

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi

          o Must be in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window

          o Must be at least 30 minutes

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The  weekly  time range (in UTC) during which system maintenance can
          occur, which might result in  an  outage.  Changing  this  parameter
          doesn't  result in an outage, except in the following situation, and
          the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.  If  there
          are  pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance window
          is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter
          will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to the
          current time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the  current
          time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

          For  more information, see Amazon RDS Maintenance Window in the Ama-
          zon RDS User Guide.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deploy-
          ment.  Changing  this  parameter  doesn't  result  in an outage. The
          change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the  Ap-
          plyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version  number  of the database engine to upgrade to. Changing
          this parameter results in an outage and the change is applied during
          the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately parameter is
          enabled for this request.

          For major version upgrades, if a nondefault DB  parameter  group  is
          currently in use, a new DB parameter group in the DB parameter group
          family for the new engine version must be specified. The new DB  pa-
          rameter group can be the default for that DB parameter group family.

          If  you  specify only a major version, Amazon RDS will update the DB
          instance to the default minor version if the current  minor  version
          is  lower. For information about valid engine versions, see CreateD-
          BInstance , or call DescribeDBEngineVersions .

          In RDS Custom for Oracle,  this  parameter  is  supported  for  read
          replicas only if they are in the PATCH_DB_FAILURE lifecycle.

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether major version upgrades  are  allowed.
          Changing  this  parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change
          is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints: Major version upgrades must be allowed when  specifying
          a  value  for  the EngineVersion parameter that is a different major
          version than the DB instance's current version.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether minor version upgrades are applied
          automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance  window.  An
          outage occurs when all the following conditions are met:

          o The automatic upgrade is enabled for the maintenance window.

          o A newer minor version is available.

          o RDS has enabled automatic patching for the engine version.

          If any of the preceding conditions isn't met, RDS applies the change
          as soon as possible and doesn't cause an outage.

          For an RDS Custom DB instance, set AutoMinorVersionUpgrade to  false
          . Otherwise, the operation returns an error.

       --license-model (string)
          The license model for the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid  values:  license-included  |  bring-your-own-license  |  gen-
          eral-public-license

       --iops (integer)
          The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value  for  the
          RDS instance.

          Changing  this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
          applied during the next maintenance window unless  the  ApplyImmedi-
          ately  parameter  is  enabled for this request. If you are migrating
          from Provisioned IOPS to standard storage, set this value to 0.  The
          DB  instance will require a reboot for the change in storage type to
          take effect.

          If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard  stor-
          age to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to us-
          ing standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the
          migration  depends on several factors such as database load, storage
          size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS),  amount  of  IOPS
          provisioned  (if  any), and the number of prior scale storage opera-
          tions. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but  the  process
          can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the
          DB instance is available for use, but might  experience  performance
          degradation.  While  the  migration takes place, nightly backups for
          the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can  take
          place  for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting
          the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the
          instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

          Constraints:  For  MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, the value
          supplied must be at least 10% greater than the current value. Values
          that  are  not  at  least  10%  greater  than the existing value are
          rounded up so that they are 10% greater than the current value.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --option-group-name (string)
          A value that indicates the DB instance should be associated with the
          specified option group.

          Changing this parameter doesn't result in an outage, with one excep-
          tion. If the parameter change results in an option  group  that  en-
          ables  OEM, it can cause a brief period, lasting less than a second,
          during which new connections are rejected but  existing  connections
          aren't interrupted.

          The  change is applied during the next maintenance window unless the
          ApplyImmediately parameter is enabled for this request.

          Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced  Secu-
          rity  TDE,  can't  be  removed from an option group, and that option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance  after  it  is  associated
          with a DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --new-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  new  DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a
          DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance
          reboot  occurs  immediately if you enable ApplyImmediately , or will
          occur during the next maintenance window if you disable Apply  Imme-
          diately. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

          If  you  specify  Provisioned  IOPS  (io1 ), you must also include a
          value for the Iops parameter.

          If you choose to migrate your DB instance from using standard  stor-
          age to using Provisioned IOPS, or from using Provisioned IOPS to us-
          ing standard storage, the process can take time. The duration of the
          migration  depends on several factors such as database load, storage
          size, storage type (standard or Provisioned IOPS),  amount  of  IOPS
          provisioned  (if  any), and the number of prior scale storage opera-
          tions. Typical migration times are under 24 hours, but  the  process
          can take up to several days in some cases. During the migration, the
          DB instance is available for use, but might  experience  performance
          degradation.  While  the  migration takes place, nightly backups for
          the instance are suspended. No other Amazon RDS operations can  take
          place  for the instance, including modifying the instance, rebooting
          the instance, deleting the instance, creating a read replica for the
          instance, and creating a DB snapshot of the instance.

          Valid values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | standard

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2

       --tde-credential-arn (string)
          The  ARN from the key store with which to associate the instance for
          TDE encryption.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --tde-credential-password (string)
          The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access
          the device.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --ca-certificate-identifier (string)
          Specifies the certificate to associate with the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain (string)
          The  Active Directory directory ID to move the DB instance to. Spec-
          ify none to remove the instance from its current  domain.  You  must
          create  the  domain before this operation. Currently, you can create
          only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server,  Oracle,  and  PostgreSQL  DB  in-
          stances in an Active Directory Domain.

          For  more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB instance
          to snapshots of the DB instance. By default, tags are not copied.
              Amazon Aurora

          Not applicable. Copying tags to snapshots is managed by the DB clus-
          ter. Setting this value for an Aurora DB instance has no  effect  on
          the DB cluster setting. For more information, see ModifyDBCluster .

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting En-
          hanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0, which is the default.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, set MonitoringInterval to a value
          other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --db-port-number (integer)
          The port number on which the database accepts connections.

          The value of the DBPortNumber parameter must not match  any  of  the
          port values specified for options in the option group for the DB in-
          stance.

          If you change the DBPortNumber value, your database restarts regard-
          less of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly  accessi-
          ble.

          When  the  DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter  is  ultimately  controlled  by the security group it uses. That
          public access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to  the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.
              PubliclyAccessible only applies to DB instances in a VPC. The DB
              instance  must be part of a public subnet and PubliclyAccessible
              must be enabled for it to be publicly accessible.

          Changes to the PubliclyAccessible parameter are applied  immediately
          regardless of the value of the ApplyImmediately parameter.

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced monitor-
          ing   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch    Logs.    For    example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a monitoring role, see To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS Enhanced
          Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, supply a Moni-
          toringRoleArn value.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the  Direc-
          tory Service.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A  value that specifies the order in which an Aurora Replica is pro-
          moted to the primary instance after a failure of the  existing  pri-
          mary  instance. For more information, see Fault Tolerance for an Au-
          rora DB Cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: 1

          Valid Values: 0 - 15

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database  ac-
          counts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

          This setting doesn't apply to Amazon Aurora. Mapping Amazon Web Ser-
          vices IAM accounts to database accounts is managed by the  DB  clus-
          ter.

          For  more  information  about  IAM  database authentication, see IAM
          Database Authentication for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the  Amazon  RDS
          User Guide.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable  Performance  Insights  for
          the DB instance.

          For  more  information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your Amazon Web Services account. Your Amazon Web  Services  account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The  number of days to retain Performance Insights data. The default
          is 7 days. The following values are valid:

          o 7

          o month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23

          o 731

          For example, the following values are valid:

          o 93 (3 months * 31)

          o 341 (11 months * 31)

          o 589 (19 months * 31)

          o 731

          If you specify a retention period such as 94, which  isn't  a  valid
          value, RDS issues an error.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --cloudwatch-logs-export-configuration (structure)
          The configuration setting for the log types to be enabled for export
          to CloudWatch Logs for a specific DB instance.

          A change to the CloudwatchLogsExportConfiguration parameter  is  al-
          ways applied to the DB instance immediately. Therefore, the ApplyIm-
          mediately parameter has no effect.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          EnableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to enable.

              (string)

          DisableLogTypes -> (list)
              The list of log types to disable.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableLogTypes=string,string,DisableLogTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableLogTypes": ["string", ...],
            "DisableLogTypes": ["string", ...]
          }

       --processor-features (list)
          The number of CPU cores and the number of threads per core  for  the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To  specify  the  number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
              name for the Name parameter. To specify the  number  of  threads
              per  core,  use the threadsPerCore feature name for the Name pa-
              rameter.

              You can set the processor features of the DB instance class  for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You  can  view  the  valid processor values for a particular in-
              stance class by calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB  instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the  number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The  current  number CPU cores and threads is set to a non-de-
                fault value.

              For more information, see Configuring the Processor  of  the  DB
              Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the processor feature. Valid names are coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature name.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          ]

       --use-default-processor-features |  --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          A  value  that indicates whether the DB instance class of the DB in-
          stance uses its default processor features.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For  more
          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For more information about this setting, including limitations  that
          apply  to  it,  see  Managing capacity automatically with Amazon RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --certificate-rotation-restart   |    --no-certificate-rotation-restart
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance is restarted when you
          rotate your SSL/TLS certificate.

          By default, the DB  instance  is  restarted  when  you  rotate  your
          SSL/TLS certificate. The certificate is not updated until the DB in-
          stance is restarted.

          WARNING:
              Set this parameter only if you are not using SSL/TLS to  connect
              to the DB instance.

          If  you  are using SSL/TLS to connect to the DB instance, follow the
          appropriate instructions for your DB engine to rotate  your  SSL/TLS
          certificate:

          o For  more  information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for
            RDS DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS Certificate. in the Ama-
            zon RDS User Guide.

          o For  more  information about rotating your SSL/TLS certificate for
            Aurora DB engines, see Rotating Your SSL/TLS  Certificate  in  the
            Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --replica-mode (string)
          A  value  that  sets  the  open mode of a replica database to either
          mounted or read-only.

          NOTE:
              Currently, this parameter is only supported for  Oracle  DB  in-
              stances.

          Mounted  DB  replicas are included in Oracle Enterprise Edition. The
          main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region  disaster  recov-
          ery.  The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard to transmit
          information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't  accept  user
          connections, a mounted replica can't serve a read-only workload. For
          more information, see Working with Oracle Read Replicas  for  Amazon
          RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Possible values:

          o open-read-only

          o mounted

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
          (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

          A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in  your
          Outpost  subnets  through  your  on-premises  network.  For some use
          cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections  to  the  DB
          instance from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your lo-
          cal network.

          For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with  Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --aws-backup-recovery-point-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point in  Amazon  Web
          Services Backup.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --automation-mode (string)
          The  automation  mode  of  the  RDS  Custom DB instance: full or all
          paused . If full , the DB instance automates monitoring and instance
          recovery. If all paused , the instance pauses automation for the du-
          ration set by ResumeFullAutomationModeMinutes .

          Possible values:

          o full

          o all-paused

       --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes (integer)
          The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time  period
          ends,  RDS  Custom  resumes full automation. The minimum value is 60
          (default). The maximum value is 1,440 .

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          Valid values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The network type is determined by the  DBSubnetGroup  specified  for
          the  DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol
          or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --storage-throughput (integer)
          Specifies the storage throughput value for the DB instance.

          This setting applies only to the gp3 storage type.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.

       --manage-master-user-password | --no-manage-master-user-password (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether to manage the  master  user  password
          with Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager.

          If  the DB cluster doesn't manage the master user password with Ama-
          zon Web Services Secrets Manager, you can turn on  this  management.
          In this case, you can't specify MasterUserPassword .

          If the DB cluster already manages the master user password with Ama-
          zon Web Services Secrets Manager, and you specify  that  the  master
          user  password  is not managed with Amazon Web Services Secrets Man-
          ager, then you must specify MasterUserPassword . In this  case,  RDS
          deletes  the  secret  and  uses the new password for the master user
          specified by MasterUserPassword .

          For more information, see Password management with Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Can't manage the master user password with Amazon Web Services Se-
            crets Manager if MasterUserPassword is specified.

       --rotate-master-user-password | --no-rotate-master-user-password (bool-
       ean)
          A  value that indicates whether to rotate the secret managed by Ama-
          zon Web Services Secrets Manager for the master user password.

          This setting is valid only if the master user password is managed by
          RDS  in  Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager for the DB cluster. The
          secret value contains the updated password.

          For more information, see Password management with Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o You  must  apply  the  change immediately when rotating the master
            user password.

       --master-user-secret-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier to encrypt a secret  that
          is  automatically  generated  and managed in Amazon Web Services Se-
          crets Manager.

          This setting is valid only if both of the following  conditions  are
          met:

          o The  DB instance doesn't manage the master user password in Amazon
            Web Services Secrets Manager. If the DB instance  already  manages
            the  master  user password in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager,
            you can't change the KMS key used to encrypt the secret.

          o You are turning on ManageMasterUserPassword to manage  the  master
            user  password  in Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. If you are
            turning on ManageMasterUserPassword and don't specify  MasterUser-
            SecretKmsKeyId  ,  then  the aws/secretsmanager KMS key is used to
            encrypt the secret. If the secret is in  a  different  Amazon  Web
            Services  account,  then  you can't use the aws/secretsmanager KMS
            key to encrypt the secret, and you must use a customer managed KMS
            key.

          The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key. To use a KMS key in a dif-
          ferent  Amazon  Web  Services  account, specify the key ARN or alias
          ARN.

          There is a default KMS key for your  Amazon  Web  Services  account.
          Your Amazon Web Services account has a different default KMS key for
          each Amazon Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a DB instance

       The following modify-db-instance example associates an option group and
       a  parameter  group with a compatible Microsoft SQL Server DB instance.
       The --apply-immediately  parameter  causes  the  option  and  parameter
       groups  to be associated immediately, instead of waiting until the next
       maintenance window.

          aws rds modify-db-instance \
              --db-instance-identifier database-2 \
              --option-group-name test-se-2017 \

                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              for the duration set by --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes .

          ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
              The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time pe-
              riod ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value
              is 60 (default). The maximum value is 1,440.

          CustomIamInstanceProfile -> (string)
              The instance profile associated with the underlying  Amazon  EC2
              instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must

              The network type of the DB instance.

              Valid values:

              o IPV4

              o DUAL

              The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified
              for the DB instance. A DBSubnetGroup can support only  the  IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the Amazon RDS User Guide and Working with a DB  instance  in  a

              Services Secrets Manager in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              SecretStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the secret.

                 The possible status values include the following:

                 o creating - The secret is being created.

                 o active  -  The secret is available for normal use and rota-
                   tion.

                 o rotating - The secret is being rotated.

                 o impaired - The secret can be used to access  database  cre-
                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier that  is  used  to
                 encrypt the secret.
