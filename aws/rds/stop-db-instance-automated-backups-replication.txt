STOP-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACSTOP-DB-INSTANCE-AUTOMATED-BACKUPS-REPLICATION()



NAME
       stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication -

DESCRIPTION
       Stops automated backup replication for a DB instance.

       This  command  doesn't  apply  to  RDS Custom, Aurora MySQL, and Aurora
       PostgreSQL.

       For more information, see Replicating Automated Backups to Another Ama-
       zon Web Services Region in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication
          --source-db-instance-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-db-instance-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the source DB instance for which
          to   stop    replicating    automated    backups,    for    example,
          arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:mydatabase .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To stop replicating automated backups

       The   following   stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication   ends
       replication of automated backups to the US West (Oregon) Region. Repli-
       cated backups are retained according to the set  backup  retention  pe-
       riod.

          aws rds stop-db-instance-automated-backups-replication \
              --region us-west-2 \
              --source-db-instance-arn "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:new-orcl-db"
