          The  DB  cluster identifier for the cluster being modified. This pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints: This identifier must match the identifier of an  exist-
          ing DB cluster.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --new-db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  new DB cluster identifier for the DB cluster when renaming a DB
          cluster. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          MinCapacity -> (integer)
              The  minimum  capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              For  Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 , 16
              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The minimum capacity must be less than or equal to  the  maximum
              capacity.

          MaxCapacity -> (integer)
              The  maximum  capacity for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB
              engine mode.

              For Aurora MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
              32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

              , 32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

              The maximum capacity must be greater than or equal to the  mini-
              mum capacity.

          AutoPause -> (boolean)
              A  value  that  indicates whether to allow or disallow automatic
              pause for an Aurora DB cluster in serverless DB engine  mode.  A
              DB  cluster can be paused only when it's idle (it has no connec-
              tions).

              NOTE:
                 If a DB cluster is paused for more than seven  days,  the  DB
                 cluster might be backed up with a snapshot. In this case, the
                 DB cluster is restored when there is a request to connect  to
                 it.

          SecondsUntilAutoPause -> (integer)
              The  time, in seconds, before an Aurora DB cluster in serverless
              mode is paused.

              Specify a value between 300 and 86,400 seconds.

          TimeoutAction -> (string)
              The action to take when the timeout is reached, either  ForceAp-
              plyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
                 ForceApplyCapacityChange  sets  the capacity to the specified
                 value as soon as possible.

                 RollbackCapacityChange , the default,  ignores  the  capacity
                 change if a scaling point isn't found in the timeout period.

              WARNING:
                 If  you  specify  ForceApplyCapacityChange , connections that
                 prevent Aurora Serverless v1 from  finding  a  scaling  point
                 might be dropped.

              For  more  information, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless v1
              in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
              The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless v1  tries
              to  find  a scaling point to perform seamless scaling before en-
              forcing the timeout action. The default is 300.

              Specify a value between 60 and 600 seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=integer,MaxCapacity=integer,AutoPause=boolean,SecondsUntilAutoPause=integer,TimeoutAction=string,SecondsBeforeTimeout=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinCapacity": integer,
            "MaxCapacity": integer,
            "AutoPause": true|false,
            "SecondsUntilAutoPause": integer,
            "TimeoutAction": "string",
            "SecondsBeforeTimeout": integer
          }

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --enable-http-endpoint | --no-enable-http-endpoint (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable the HTTP  endpoint  for  an
          Aurora  Serverless  v1  DB cluster. By default, the HTTP endpoint is
          disabled.

          When enabled, the HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless  web  ser-
          vice  API  for  running  SQL  queries on the Aurora Serverless v1 DB
          cluster. You can also query your database from inside the  RDS  con-
          sole with the query editor.

          For  more  information, see Using the Data API for Aurora Serverless
          v1 in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to copy all tags from the DB  cluster
          to snapshots of the DB cluster. The default is not to copy them.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB clusters

       --enable-global-write-forwarding  | --no-enable-global-write-forwarding
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable this DB cluster to  forward
          write operations to the primary cluster of an Aurora global database
          ( GlobalCluster ). By default, write operations are not  allowed  on
          Aurora  DB  clusters that are secondary clusters in an Aurora global
          database.

          You can set this value only on Aurora DB clusters that  are  members
          of  an  Aurora  global database. With this parameter enabled, a sec-
          ondary cluster can forward writes to the current primary cluster and
          the  resulting  changes are replicated back to this cluster. For the
          primary DB cluster of an Aurora global database, this value is  used
          immediately  if the primary is demoted by the  FailoverGlobalCluster
          API operation, but it does nothing until then.

          Valid for: Aurora DB clusters only

       --db-cluster-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of each DB instance in the  Multi-AZ
          DB  cluster, for example db.m6gd.xlarge. Not all DB instance classes

          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If  you don't specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your  Amazon  Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a DB cluster

       The  following  modify-db-cluster example changes the master user pass-
       word for the DB cluster named cluster-2 and sets the  backup  retention
       period to 14 days. The --apply-immediately parameter causes the changes
       to be made immediately, instead of waiting until the  next  maintenance
       window.

          aws rds modify-db-cluster \
              --db-cluster-identifier cluster-2 \
              --backup-retention-period 14 \
              --master-user-password newpassword99 \

OUTPUT
       DBCluster -> (structure)
          Contains the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or  Multi-AZ  DB
          cluster.

          For  an  Amazon  Aurora  DB cluster, this data type is used as a re-
          sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBCluster ,
          DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster  ,  ModifyDBCluster  , Pro-
          moteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3  ,  RestoreDBClus-
          terFromSnapshot  ,  RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime , StartDBCluster ,
          and StopDBCluster .

          For a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response ele-
          ment  in  the  operations  CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster , De-
          scribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster  ,  RebootDB-
          Cluster  ,  RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and RestoreDBClusterTo-
          PointInTime .

          For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is  Ama-
          zon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

          For  more  information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deploy-
          ments with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS  User
          Guide.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              For  all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStorage
              specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes (GiB). For Au-
              rora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora DB clus-
              ter storage size isn't fixed, but instead automatically  adjusts
              as needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances in
              the DB cluster can be created.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              If  present,  specifies  the name of the character set that this
              cluster is associated with.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          AutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when a stopped DB cluster is restarted automatically.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              The  earliest  time  to  which  a  database can be restored with
              point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora  Repli-
              cas  that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new
              connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distributes the  con-
              nection  requests  among  the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.
              This functionality can help balance your  read  workload  across
              multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover occurs, and the Aurora Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          CustomEndpoints -> (list)
              Identifies all custom endpoints associated with the cluster.

              (string)

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  DB  cluster  has  instances in multiple
              Availability Zones.

          Engine -> (string)
              The name of the database engine to be used for this DB cluster.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Indicates the database engine version.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the latest time to which a database  can  be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

          MasterUsername -> (string)
              Contains the master username for the DB cluster.

          DBClusterOptionGroupMemberships -> (list)
              Provides  the list of option group memberships for this DB clus-
              ter.

              (structure)
                 Contains status information for a DB cluster option group.

                 DBClusterOptionGroupName -> (string)
                     Specifies the name of the DB cluster option group.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Specifies the status of the DB cluster option group.

          PreferredBackupWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the daily time range during  which  automated  backups
              are  created  if automated backups are enabled, as determined by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which system  maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

              Serverless v1 DB cluster is enabled.

              When  enabled,  the  HTTP endpoint provides a connectionless web
              service API for running SQL queries on the Aurora Serverless  v1
              DB cluster. You can also query your database from inside the RDS
              console with the query editor.

          PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
              Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

              When  the  DB  instance  is publicly accessible, its Domain Name
              System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private  IP  address  from
              within  the  DB  instance's  virtual private cloud (VPC). It re-
              solves to the public IP address  from  outside  of  the  DB  in-
              stance's VPC. Access to the DB instance is ultimately controlled
              by the security group it uses. That public access is not permit-
              ted  if  the  security group assigned to the DB instance doesn't
              permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

              For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              A value that indicates that minor version  patches  are  applied
              automatically.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringInterval -> (integer)
              The  interval, in seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitor-
              ing metrics are collected for the DB cluster.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          MonitoringRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send Enhanced Moni-
              toring metrics to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsEnabled -> (boolean)
              True  if Performance Insights is enabled for the DB cluster, and
              otherwise false.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services KMS key  identifier  for  encryption  of
              Performance Insights data.

              The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN, key
              ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          PerformanceInsightsRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. The  de-
              fault is 7 days. The following values are valid:

              o 7

              o month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23

              o 731

              For example, the following values are valid:

              o 93 (3 months * 31)

              o 341 (11 months * 31)

              o 589 (19 months * 31)

              o 731

              This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          ServerlessV2ScalingConfiguration -> (structure)
              Shows  the  scaling configuration for an Aurora Serverless v2 DB
              cluster.

              For more information, see Using Amazon Aurora Serverless  v2  in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

              MinCapacity -> (double)
                 The  minimum  number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for a DB
                 instance in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can  specify
                 ACU values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so
                 on. The smallest value that you can use is 0.5.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The maximum number of Aurora capacity units (ACUs) for  a  DB
                 instance  in an Aurora Serverless v2 cluster. You can specify
                 ACU values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and
                 so on. The largest value that you can use is 128.

          NetworkType -> (string)
              The network type of the DB instance.

              Valid values:

              o IPV4

              o DUAL

              The  network  type  is determined by the DBSubnetGroup specified
              for the DB cluster. A DBSubnetGroup can support  only  the  IPv4
              protocol or the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

              For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in
              the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              This setting is only for Aurora DB clusters.

          DBSystemId -> (string)
              Reserved for future use.
