RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-FROM-DB-SNAPSHOT()  RESTORE-DB-INSTANCE-FROM-DB-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  DB instance from a DB snapshot. The target database is
       created from the  source  database  restore  point  with  most  of  the
       source's  original  configuration, including the default security group
       and DB parameter group. By default, the new DB instance is created as a
       Single-AZ deployment, except when the instance is a SQL Server instance
       that has an option group associated with mirroring. In this  case,  the
       instance becomes a Multi-AZ deployment, not a Single-AZ deployment.

       If you want to replace your original DB instance with the new, restored
       DB instance, then rename your original DB instance before you call  the
       RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot operation. RDS doesn't allow two DB in-
       stances with the same name. After you have renamed your original DB in-
       stance with a different identifier, then you can pass the original name
       of the DB instance as the DBInstanceIdentifier in the call to  the  Re-
       storeDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot operation. The result is that you replace
       the original DB instance with the DB instance created  from  the  snap-
       shot.

       If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DBSnapshotI-
       dentifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

       NOTE:
          This command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL  and  Aurora  PostgreSQL.
          For Aurora, use RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot .

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The name of the DB instance to create from the DB snapshot. This pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 numbers, letters, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-snapshot-id

       --db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the DB snapshot to restore from.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DB snapshot.

          o Can't be specified when DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier is specified.

          o Must be specified when  DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier  isn't  speci-
            fied.

          o If you are restoring from a shared manual DB snapshot, the DBSnap-
            shotIdentifier must be the ARN of the shared DB snapshot.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of the Amazon RDS DB  instance,  for
          example  db.m4.large.  Not  all DB instance classes are available in
          all Amazon Web Services Regions, or for all  database  engines.  For
          the  full list of DB instance classes, and availability for your en-
          gine, see DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Default: The same DBInstanceClass as the original DB instance.

       --port (integer)
          The port number on which the database accepts connections.

          Default: The same port as the original DB instance

          Constraints: Value must be 1150-65535

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the DB instance will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone.

          Constraint: You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if  the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

          Example: us-east-1a

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB subnet group to use for the new instance.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing DB subnet group.

          Example: mydbsubnetgroup

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Constraint:  You can't specify the AvailabilityZone parameter if the
          DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment.

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance is publicly accessible.

          When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public IP
          address  from outside of the DB instance's VPC. Access to the DB in-
          stance is ultimately controlled by the security group it uses.  That
          public access is not permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB instance doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to automatically apply minor version  upgrades  to
          the DB instance during the maintenance window.

          If  you restore an RDS Custom DB instance, you must disable this pa-
          rameter.

       --license-model (string)
          License model information for the restored DB instance.

          NOTE:
              License models for RDS for Db2 require additional configuration.
              The Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model requires a custom param-
              eter group. The Db2 license through Amazon Web Services  Market-
              place  model  requires  an  Amazon Web Services Marketplace sub-
              scription. For more information, see RDS for Db2  licensing  op-
              tions in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This  setting  doesn't  apply  to Amazon Aurora or RDS Custom DB in-
          stances.

          Valid Values:

          o RDS for Db2 - bring-your-own-license | marketplace-license

          o RDS for MariaDB - general-public-license

          o RDS for Microsoft SQL Server - license-included

          o RDS for MySQL - general-public-license

          o RDS for Oracle - bring-your-own-license | license-included

          o RDS for PostgreSQL - postgresql-license

          Default: Same as the source.

       --db-name (string)
          The name of the database for the restored DB instance.

          This parameter only applies to RDS for Oracle and RDS for SQL Server
          DB instances. It doesn't apply to the other engines or to RDS Custom
          DB instances.

       --engine (string)
          The database engine to use for the new instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: The same as source

          Constraint: Must be compatible with the engine of  the  source.  For
          example, you can restore a MariaDB 10.1 DB instance from a MySQL 5.6
          snapshot.

          Valid Values:

          o db2-ae

          o db2-se

          o mariadb

          o mysql

          o oracle-ee

          o oracle-ee-cdb

          o oracle-se2

          o oracle-se2-cdb

          o postgres

          o sqlserver-ee

          o sqlserver-se

          o sqlserver-ex

       --iops (integer)
          Specifies the amount of provisioned IOPS for the  DB  instance,  ex-
          pressed in I/O operations per second. If this parameter isn't speci-
          fied, the IOPS value is taken from the backup. If this parameter  is
          set to 0, the new instance is converted to a non-PIOPS instance. The
          conversion takes additional time, though your DB instance is  avail-
          able for connections before the conversion starts.

          The  provisioned  IOPS  value  must follow the requirements for your
          database engine. For more information, see  Amazon  RDS  Provisioned
          IOPS storage in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints: Must be an integer greater than 1000.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  option  group to be used for the restored DB in-
          stance.

          Permanent options, such as the TDE option for Oracle Advanced  Secu-
          rity  TDE,  can't  be  removed from an option group, and that option
          group can't be removed from a DB instance  after  it  is  associated
          with a DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags.

          For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS resources in the Amazon

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          Specifies  whether to copy all tags from the restored DB instance to
          snapshots of the DB instance.

          In most cases, tags aren't copied by default. However, when you  re-
          store a DB instance from a DB snapshot, RDS checks whether you spec-
          ify new tags. If yes, the new tags are added to the restored DB  in-
          stance.  If  there  are no new tags, RDS looks for the tags from the
          source DB instance for the DB snapshot, and then adds those tags  to
          the restored DB instance.

          For  more  information, see Copying tags to DB instance snapshots in
          the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM role to use when making API calls to the  Direc-

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          Specifies whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web Services  Identity
          and  Access  Management  (IAM) accounts to database accounts. By de-
          fault, mapping is disabled.

          For more information about  IAM  database  authentication,  see  IAM
          Database  Authentication  for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the Amazon RDS
          User Guide.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of logs for the restored DB instance to  export  to  Cloud-
          Watch Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine. For more
          information, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon CloudWatch  Logs
          in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --processor-features (list)
          The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use  the  coreCount  feature
              name  for  the  Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
              per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the  Name  pa-
              rameter.

              You  can set the processor features of the DB instance class for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You can view the valid processor values  for  a  particular  in-
              stance  class  by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In  addition,  you can use the following actions for DB instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number

          certificate.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom DB instances.

          For more information, see Using SSL/TLS to encrypt a connection to a
          DB instance in the Amazon RDS User Guide and Using  SSL/TLS  to  en-
          crypt a connection to a DB cluster in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       --engine-lifecycle-support (string)
          The life cycle type for this DB instance.

          NOTE:
              By  default,  this value is set to open-source-rds-extended-sup-
              port , which enrolls your DB instance into Amazon  RDS  Extended
              Support.  At  the end of standard support, you can avoid charges
              for Extended Support by setting the value to open-source-rds-ex-
              tended-support-disabled  .  In  this case, RDS automatically up-
              grades your restored DB instance to a higher engine version,  if
              the  major  engine  version  is past its end of standard support
              date.

          You can use this setting to enroll your DB instance into Amazon  RDS
          Extended  Support.  With  RDS  Extended Support, you can run the se-
          lected major engine version on your DB  instance  past  the  end  of
          standard  support for that engine version. For more information, see
          Using Amazon RDS Extended Support in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting applies only to RDS for MySQL and RDS  for  PostgreSQL.
          For  Amazon  Aurora  DB instances, the life cycle type is managed by
          the DB cluster.

          Valid Values: open-source-rds-extended-support | open-source-rds-ex-
          tended-support-disabled

          Default: open-source-rds-extended-support

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       To restore a DB instance from a DB snapshot

       The  following  restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot  example creates a
       new DB instance named db7-new-instance with the db.t3.small DB instance
       class from the specified DB snapshot. The source DB instance from which
       the snapshot was taken uses a deprecated  DB  instance  class,  so  you
       can't upgrade it.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB instance is publicly accessible and you connect from
              outside  of  the  DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC), its
              Domain Name System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the public IP  ad-
              dress.  When  you connect from within the same VPC as the DB in-
              stance, the endpoint resolves to the private IP address.  Access
              to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the security group
              it uses. That public access  isn't  permitted  if  the  security
              group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an inter-
              nal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP
              address.

                 You  can view the valid processor values for a particular in-
                 stance class by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions  action and specifying the instance class for the DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.
