MODIFY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT-ATTRIBUTE()  MODIFY-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT-ATTRIBUTE()



NAME
       modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  an  attribute  and  values to, or removes an attribute and values
       from, a manual DB cluster snapshot.

       To share a manual DB cluster snapshot with other  Amazon  Web  Services
       accounts,  specify restore as the AttributeName and use the ValuesToAdd
       parameter to add a list of IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts that
       are authorized to restore the manual DB cluster snapshot. Use the value
       all to make the manual DB cluster snapshot public, which means that  it
       can be copied or restored by all Amazon Web Services accounts.

       NOTE:
          Don't  add  the  all  value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that
          contain private information that you don't  want  available  to  all
          Amazon Web Services accounts.

       If  a  manual  DB  cluster snapshot is encrypted, it can be shared, but
       only by specifying a list of authorized Amazon Web Services account IDs
       for  the  ValuesToAdd  parameter. You can't use all as a value for that
       parameter in this case.

       To view which Amazon Web Services accounts have access to copy  or  re-
       store  a  manual  DB  cluster  snapshot, or whether a manual DB cluster
       snapshot is public or private,  use  the   DescribeDBClusterSnapshotAt-
       tributes API operation. The accounts are returned as values for the re-
       store attribute.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute
          --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          --attribute-name <value>
          [--values-to-add <value>]
          [--values-to-remove <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier for the DB cluster snapshot to modify the  attributes
          for.

       --attribute-name (string)
          The name of the DB cluster snapshot attribute to modify.

          To  manage  authorization  for other Amazon Web Services accounts to
          copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, set this value to  re-
          store .

          NOTE:
              To view the list of attributes available to modify, use the  De-
              scribeDBClusterSnapshotAttributes API operation.

       --values-to-add (list)
          A list of DB cluster snapshot attributes to  add  to  the  attribute
          specified by AttributeName .

          To authorize other Amazon Web Services accounts to copy or restore a
          manual DB cluster snapshot, set this list to  include  one  or  more
          Amazon  Web Services account IDs, or all to make the manual DB clus-
          ter snapshot restorable by any Amazon Web Services account.  Do  not
          add  the  all value for any manual DB cluster snapshots that contain
          private information that you don't want available to all Amazon  Web
          Services accounts.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --values-to-remove (list)
          A  list  of DB cluster snapshot attributes to remove from the attri-
          bute specified by AttributeName .

          To remove authorization for other Amazon Web  Services  accounts  to
          copy  or  restore a manual DB cluster snapshot, set this list to in-
          clude one or more Amazon Web Services account identifiers, or all to
          remove  authorization for any Amazon Web Services account to copy or
          restore the DB cluster snapshot. If you specify all , an Amazon  Web
          Services account whose account ID is explicitly added to the restore
          attribute can still copy or restore a manual DB cluster snapshot.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To modify a DB cluster snapshot attribute

       The  following   modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute   example   makes
       changes to the specified DB cluster snapshot attribute.

          aws rds modify-db-cluster-snapshot-attribute \
              --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier myclustersnapshot \
              --attribute-name restore \
              --values-to-add 123456789012

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterSnapshotAttributesResult": {
                  "DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier": "myclustersnapshot",
                  "DBClusterSnapshotAttributes": [
                      {
                          "AttributeName": "restore",
                          "AttributeValues": [
                              "123456789012"
                          ]
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       DBClusterSnapshotAttributesResult -> (structure)
          Contains the results of a successful call to the  DescribeDBCluster-
          SnapshotAttributes API action.

          Manual  DB  cluster  snapshot attributes are used to authorize other
          Amazon Web Services accounts to copy or restore a manual DB  cluster
          snapshot.  For  more information, see the ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAt-
          tribute API action.

          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              The identifier of the manual DB cluster snapshot  that  the  at-
              tributes apply to.

          DBClusterSnapshotAttributes -> (list)
              The  list  of  attributes  and  values for the manual DB cluster
              snapshot.

              (structure)
                 Contains the name and values of a manual DB cluster  snapshot
                 attribute.

                 Manual  DB  cluster snapshot attributes are used to authorize
                 other Amazon Web Services accounts to  restore  a  manual  DB
                 cluster snapshot. For more information, see the ModifyDBClus-
                 terSnapshotAttribute API action.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the manual DB cluster snapshot attribute.

                     The attribute named restore refers to the list of  Amazon
                     Web Services accounts that have permission to copy or re-
                     store the manual DB cluster snapshot. For  more  informa-
                     tion,  see  the  ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API ac-
                     tion.

                 AttributeValues -> (list)
                     The value(s) for the manual DB  cluster  snapshot  attri-
                     bute.

                     If  the AttributeName field is set to restore , then this
                     element returns a list of IDs of the Amazon Web  Services
                     accounts  that are authorized to copy or restore the man-
                     ual DB cluster snapshot. If a value  of  all  is  in  the
                     list,  then  the manual DB cluster snapshot is public and
                     available for any Amazon Web Services account to copy  or
                     restore.
