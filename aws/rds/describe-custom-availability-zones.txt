NAME
       describe-custom-availability-zones -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about custom Availability Zones (AZs).

       A  custom  AZ  is  an  on-premises  AZ that is integrated with a VMware
       vSphere cluster.

       For more information about RDS on VMware, see the RDS  on  VMware  User
       Guide.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-custom-availability-zones  is  a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: CustomAvailabilityZones

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-availability-zones
          [--custom-availability-zone-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --custom-availability-zone-id (string)
          The custom AZ identifier. If this parameter is  specified,  informa-
          tion from only the specific custom AZ is returned.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more custom AZs to describe.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional pagination token provided by a previous DescribeCustom-
          AvailabilityZones request. If this parameter is specified,  the  re-
          sponse  includes  only  records  beyond  the marker, up to the value
          specified by MaxRecords .

       CustomAvailabilityZones -> (list)
          The list of  CustomAvailabilityZone objects for the Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices account.

          (structure)
              A custom Availability Zone (AZ) is an on-premises AZ that is in-
              tegrated with a VMware vSphere cluster.

                 site.

                 VpnId -> (string)
                     The ID of the VPN.

                 VpnTunnelOriginatorIP -> (string)

                     The  IP  address  of network traffic from Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices to your on-premises data center.

                 VpnPSK -> (string)
                     The preshared key (PSK) for the VPN.

                 VpnName -> (string)
                     The name of the VPN.
