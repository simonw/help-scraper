DESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCES()                                DESCRIBE-DB-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-db-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about provisioned RDS instances. This API supports
       pagination.

       NOTE:
          This operation can also return information for Amazon Neptune DB in-
          stances and Amazon DocumentDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-instances  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DBInstances

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-instances
          [--db-instance-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied instance identifier. If this parameter  is  speci-
          fied,  information  from  only the specific DB instance is returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB instances to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only includes informa-
            tion about the DB instances associated with the DB clusters  iden-
            tified by these ARNs.

          o db-instance-id  -  Accepts DB instance identifiers and DB instance
            Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list only  includes  in-
            formation about the DB instances identified by these ARNs.

          o dbi-resource-id  -  Accepts  DB instance resource identifiers. The
            results list will only include information about the DB  instances
            identified by these DB instance resource identifiers.

          o domain  - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list
            only includes information about the DB instances  associated  with
            these domains.

          o engine  - Accepts engine names. The results list only includes in-
            formation about the DB instances for these engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        class.

                        To specify the number of CPU cores, use the  coreCount
                        feature  name  for  the Name parameter. To specify the
                        number of threads per  core,  use  the  threadsPerCore
                        feature name for the Name parameter.

                        You  can set the processor features of the DB instance
                        class for a DB instance when you call one of the  fol-
                        lowing actions:

                        o CreateDBInstance

                        o ModifyDBInstance

                        o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                        You can view the valid processor values for a particu-
                        lar instance class by calling the  DescribeOrderableD-
                        BInstanceOptions  action  and  specifying the instance
                        class for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                        In addition, you can use the following actions for  DB
                        instance class processor information:

                        o DescribeDBInstances

                        o DescribeDBSnapshots

                        o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                        If you call DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature re-
                        turns non-null values only if the following conditions
                        are met:

                        o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                        o Your  Oracle  DB instance class supports configuring
                          the number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                        o The current number CPU cores and threads is set to a
                          non-default value.

                 ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
                     The  number  of minutes to pause the automation. When the
                     time period ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The
                     minimum  value  is  60  (default).  The  maximum value is
                     1,440.

              LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the latest time to which a database can be restored

                 Contains  one  or  more  identifiers of Aurora DB clusters to
                 which the RDS DB instance is replicated as  a  read  replica.
                 For example, when you create an Aurora read replica of an RDS
                 for MySQL DB instance, the Aurora MySQL DB  cluster  for  the
                 Aurora read replica is shown. This output doesn't contain in-
                 formation about cross-Region Aurora read replicas.

                 NOTE:
                     Currently, each RDS DB instance can have only one  Aurora
                     read replica.

                 Zone for a DB instance with multi-AZ support.

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

                 When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its  Domain  Name
                 System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from
                 within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC).  It  re-
                 solves  to the public IP address from outside of the DB clus-
                 ter's VPC. Access to the DB cluster is ultimately  controlled
                 by  the security group it uses. That public access isn't per-
                 mitted if the security  group  assigned  to  the  DB  cluster
                 doesn't permit it.

                 When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an in-
                 ternal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private
                 IP address.

                        ing  normally, or false if the instance is in an error
                        state.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Status of the DB instance. For a  StatusType  of  read
                        replica,  the  values  can be replicating, replication
                        stop point set, replication stop point reached, error,

              ProcessorFeatures -> (list)
                 The number of CPU cores and the number of  threads  per  core
                 for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.
