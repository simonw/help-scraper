DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()                                  DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-db-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  Amazon  Aurora DB clusters and Multi-AZ DB
       clusters. This API supports pagination.

       For more information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What  is  Amazon
       Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

       For  more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

       NOTE:
          The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview  and  is  subject  to
          change.

       This  operation  can  also return information for Amazon Neptune DB in-
       stances and Amazon DocumentDB instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DBClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-clusters
          [--db-cluster-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--include-shared | --no-include-shared]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The user-supplied DB cluster identifier. If this parameter is speci-
          fied, information from only the specific  DB  cluster  is  returned.
          This parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match an existing DBClusterIdentifier.

       --filters (list)
          A filter that specifies one or more DB clusters to describe.

          Supported filters:

          o clone-group-id - Accepts clone group identifiers. The results list
            will only include information about  the  DB  clusters  associated
            with these clone groups.

          o db-cluster-id - Accepts DB cluster identifiers and DB cluster Ama-
            zon Resource Names (ARNs). The results list will only include  in-
            formation about the DB clusters identified by these ARNs.

          o domain  - Accepts Active Directory directory IDs. The results list
            will only include information about  the  DB  clusters  associated
            with these domains.

          o engine  - Accepts engine names. The results list will only include
            information about the DB clusters for these engines.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          Optional Boolean parameter that specifies  whether  the  output  in-
          cludes  information about clusters shared from other Amazon Web Ser-
          vices accounts.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list certain attributes of all DB clusters

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier, Endpoint, and ReaderEndpoint attributes of all  your  DB
       clusters in the current AWS Region.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Endpoint:Endpoint,ReaderEndpoint:ReaderEndpoint}'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-2270"
              },
              {
                  "Endpoint": "cluster-57-2020-05-01-4615.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",

              },
              {
                  "Endpoint": "pg2-cluster.cluster-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
                  "ReaderEndpoint": "pg2-cluster.cluster-ro-cnpexample.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",

              },
              ...output omitted...
              }
          ]

       Example 3: To list DB clusters with a specific attribute

       The  following  describe-db-clusters example retrieves only the DBClus-
       terIdentifier and Engine attributes of your DB clusters  that  use  the
       aurora-postgresql DB engine.

          aws rds describe-db-clusters \
              --query 'DBClusters[].{DBClusterIdentifier:DBClusterIdentifier,Engine:Engine} | [?Engine == `aurora-postgresql`]'

       Output:

          [
              {
                  "Engine": "aurora-postgresql",
                  "DBClusterIdentifier": "pg2-cluster"
              }
          ]

       For  more  information, see Amazon Aurora DB Clusters in the Amazon Au-
       rora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in  a  later  DescribeDBClusters
          request.

       DBClusters -> (list)
          Contains a list of DB clusters for the user.

          (structure)
              Contains  the details of an Amazon Aurora DB cluster or Multi-AZ
              DB cluster.

              For an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, this data type is used as a re-
              sponse element in the operations CreateDBCluster , DeleteDBClus-
              ter , DescribeDBClusters , FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster ,
              PromoteReadReplicaDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromS3 , RestoreD-
              BClusterFromSnapshot , RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime ,  StartDB-
              Cluster , and StopDBCluster .

              For  a Multi-AZ DB cluster, this data type is used as a response
              element in the operations CreateDBCluster  ,  DeleteDBCluster  ,
              DescribeDBClusters  ,  FailoverDBCluster , ModifyDBCluster , Re-
              bootDBCluster , RestoreDBClusterFromSnapshot  ,  and  RestoreDB-
              ClusterToPointInTime .

              For  more  information on Amazon Aurora DB clusters, see What is
              Amazon Aurora? in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

              For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see  Multi-AZ  de-
              ployments  with  two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon
              RDS User Guide.

              NOTE:
                 The Multi-AZ DB clusters feature is in preview and is subject
                 to change.

              AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
                 For all database engines except Amazon Aurora, AllocatedStor-
                 age specifies the allocated storage size in gibibytes  (GiB).
                 For Aurora, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because Aurora
                 DB cluster storage size isn't fixed,  but  instead  automati-
                 cally adjusts as needed.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of Availability Zones (AZs) where instances
                 in the DB cluster can be created.

                 (string)

              BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
                 Specifies the number of days for which automatic DB snapshots
                 are retained.

              CharacterSetName -> (string)
                 If present, specifies the name of the character set that this
                 cluster is associated with.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 Contains the name of the initial database of this DB  cluster
                 that  was  provided at create time, if one was specified when
                 the DB cluster was created. This same name  is  returned  for
                 the life of the DB cluster.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for  the
                 DB cluster.

              DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
                 Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the
                 DB cluster, including the name, description, and  subnets  in

                 for  a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Aurora
                 Replicas that are available in a DB cluster. As  clients  re-
                 quest new connections to the reader endpoint, Aurora distrib-
                 utes the connection requests among the Aurora Replicas in the
                 DB  cluster.  This  functionality  can help balance your read
                 workload across multiple Aurora Replicas in your DB cluster.

                 If a failover occurs, and the Aurora  Replica  that  you  are
                 connected  to  is  promoted  to be the primary instance, your
                 connection is dropped. To continue sending your read workload
                 to  other Aurora Replicas in the cluster, you can then recon-
                 nect to the reader endpoint.

                 Specifies whether you have requested to enable write forward-
                 ing for a secondary cluster in an Aurora global database. Be-
                 cause write forwarding takes time to enable, check the  value
                 of  GlobalWriteForwardingStatus  to  confirm that the request
                 has completed before using the write forwarding  feature  for
                 this cluster.

                        vated. After they are  deactivated,  these  log  types
                        aren't exported to CloudWatch Logs.

                        (string)

                     LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                        Log  types  that  are in the process of being enabled.
                        After they are enabled, these log types  are  exported
                        to CloudWatch Logs.

                 EngineVersion -> (string)
                     The database engine version.

              DBClusterInstanceClass -> (string)
                 The  name  of the compute and memory capacity class of the DB
                 instance.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              StorageType -> (string)
                 The storage type associated with the DB cluster.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value.

                 This setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

              PubliclyAccessible -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the accessibility options for the DB instance.

                 When the DB instance is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name
                 System (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from
                 within the DB instance's virtual private cloud (VPC). It  re-
                 solves  to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB in-
                 stance's VPC. Access to the DB instance  is  ultimately  con-
                 trolled  by the security group it uses. That public access is
                 not permitted if the security group assigned to  the  DB  in-
                 stance doesn't permit it.

                 When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an in-
                 ternal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private
                 IP address.

              PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of
                 Performance Insights data.

                 The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is  the  key  ARN,
                 key ID, alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.
