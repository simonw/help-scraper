DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()                      DELETE-DB-CLUSTER-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       delete-db-cluster-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  DB  cluster  snapshot. If the snapshot is being copied, the
       copy operation is terminated.

       NOTE:
          The DB cluster snapshot  must  be  in  the  available  state  to  be
          deleted.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       For more information on Multi-AZ DB clusters, see Multi-AZ  deployments
       with two readable standby DB instances in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-cluster-snapshot
          --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to delete.

          Constraints:  Must be the name of an existing DB cluster snapshot in
          the available state.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To delete a DB cluster snapshot

       The following delete-db-cluster-snapshot example deletes the  specified
       DB cluster snapshot.

          aws rds delete-db-cluster-snapshot \
              --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier mydbclustersnapshot
