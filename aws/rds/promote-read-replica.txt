PROMOTE-READ-REPLICA()                                  PROMOTE-READ-REPLICA()



NAME
       promote-read-replica -

DESCRIPTION
       Promotes a read replica DB instance to a standalone DB instance.

       NOTE:

          o Backup  duration  is  a  function  of the amount of changes to the
            database since the previous backup. If you plan to promote a  read
            replica  to  a  standalone  instance, we recommend that you enable
            backups and complete at least one backup prior  to  promotion.  In
            addition,  a  read  replica cannot be promoted to a standalone in-
            stance when it is in the backing-up status. If  you  have  enabled
            backups  on your read replica, configure the automated backup win-
            dow so that daily backups do not interfere with read replica  pro-
            motion.

          o This  command doesn't apply to Aurora MySQL, Aurora PostgreSQL, or
            RDS Custom.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            promote-read-replica
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          [--backup-retention-period <value>]
          [--preferred-backup-window <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The DB instance identifier. This value  is  stored  as  a  lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing read replica DB instance.

          Example: mydbinstance

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days for which automated backups are retained. Setting
          this parameter to a positive number enables  backups.  Setting  this
          parameter to 0 disables automated backups.

          Default: 1

          Constraints:

          o Must be a value from 0 to 35.

          o Can't be set to 0 if the DB instance is a source to read replicas.

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily  time range during which automated backups are created if
          automated backups are enabled, using the  BackupRetentionPeriod  pa-
          rameter.

          The  default is a 30-minute window selected at random from an 8-hour
          block of time for each Amazon Web Services Region. To see  the  time
          blocks  available, see Adjusting the Preferred Maintenance Window in
          the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi .

          o Must be in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window.

          o Must be at least 30 minutes.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 The number of CPU cores and the number of  threads  per  core
                 for the DB instance class of the DB instance.

                 (structure)
                     Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                     To  specify  the  number  of CPU cores, use the coreCount
                     feature name for the Name parameter. To specify the  num-
                     ber  of  threads per core, use the threadsPerCore feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You can set the processor features  of  the  DB  instance
                     class  for a DB instance when you call one of the follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                     o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

                     o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

                     You can view the valid processor values for a  particular
                     instance  class  by  calling  the  DescribeOrderableDBIn-
                     stanceOptions action and specifying  the  instance  class
                     for the DBInstanceClass parameter.

                     In addition, you can use the following actions for DB in-
                     stance class processor information:

                     o DescribeDBInstances

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  re-
                     turns  non-null  values  only if the following conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring  the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The  current  number  CPU cores and threads is set to a
                       non-default value.

                     For more information, see Configuring  the  Processor  of
                     the DB Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  processor feature. Valid names are

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem  (DNS)  endpoint  resolves  to  the  private IP address from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to  the  public IP address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC.
              Access to the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by  the  secu-
              rity  group  it  uses. That public access isn't permitted if the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an  inter-
              nal  DB  instance  with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP
              address.

          DBInstanceAutomatedBackupsReplications -> (list)
              The list of replicated automated backups associated with the  DB
              instance.

              (structure)
                 Automated backups of a DB instance replicated to another Ama-
                 zon Web Services Region.  They  consist  of  system  backups,
                 transaction logs, and database instance properties.

                 DBInstanceAutomatedBackupsArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the replicated auto-
                     mated backups.

          CustomerOwnedIpEnabled -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether a customer-owned IP address (CoIP) is  enabled
              for an RDS on Outposts DB instance.

              A  CoIP  provides local or external connectivity to resources in
              your Outpost subnets through your on-premises network. For  some
              use  cases,  a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to
              the DB instance from outside of its virtual private cloud  (VPC)
              on your local network.

              For  more  information  about  RDS on Outposts, see Working with
              Amazon RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts  in  the  Amazon  RDS
              User Guide .

              For  more  information  about  CoIPs,  see Customer-owned IP ad-
              dresses in the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

          AwsBackupRecoveryPointArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recovery point  in  Amazon
              Web Services Backup.

          ActivityStreamStatus -> (string)
              The status of the database activity stream.

          ActivityStreamKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Web Services KMS key identifier used for encrypting
              messages in the database activity stream. The  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  KMS  key identifier is the key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or
              alias name for the KMS key.

          ActivityStreamKinesisStreamName -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon Kinesis data stream used for the database
              activity stream.

          ActivityStreamMode -> (string)
              The  mode  of the database activity stream. Database events such
              as a change or access generate an activity stream event. RDS for
              Oracle always handles these events asynchronously.

          ActivityStreamEngineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether engine-native audit fields are included in the
              database activity stream.

          AutomationMode -> (string)
              The automation mode of the RDS Custom DB instance: full  or  all
              paused  . If full , the DB instance automates monitoring and in-
              stance recovery. If all paused , the instance pauses  automation
              for the duration set by --resume-full-automation-mode-minutes .

          ResumeFullAutomationModeTime -> (timestamp)
              The number of minutes to pause the automation. When the time pe-
              riod ends, RDS Custom resumes full automation. The minimum value
              is 60 (default). The maximum value is 1,440.

          CustomIamInstanceProfile -> (string)
              The  instance  profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2
              instance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must
              meet the following requirements:

              o The profile must exist in your account.

              o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permis-
                sions to assume.

              o The instance profile name and the  associated  IAM  role  name
                must start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

              For  the  list  of  permissions  required  for the IAM role, see
              Configure IAM and your VPC in  the  Amazon  Relational  Database
              Service User Guide .

          BackupTarget -> (string)
              Specifies  where  automated  backups  and  manual  snapshots are
              stored: Amazon Web Services Outposts or the Amazon Web  Services
