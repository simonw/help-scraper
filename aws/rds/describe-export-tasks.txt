DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()                                DESCRIBE-EXPORT-TASKS()



NAME
       describe-export-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a snapshot export to Amazon S3. This API op-
       eration supports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-export-tasks is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ExportTasks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-export-tasks
          [--export-task-identifier <value>]
          [--source-arn <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-task-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the snapshot export task to be described.

       --source-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the snapshot exported to Amazon
          S3.

       --filters (list)
          Filters specify one or more snapshot exports to describe.  The  fil-
          ters  are  specified as name-value pairs that define what to include
          in the output. Filter names and values are case-sensitive.

          Supported filters include the following:

          o export-task-identifier - An identifier  for  the  snapshot  export
            task.

          o s3-bucket - The Amazon S3 bucket the snapshot is exported to.

          o source-arn  -  The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the snapshot ex-
            ported to Amazon S3

          o status - The status of the export task. Must be  lowercase.  Valid
            statuses are the following:

            o canceled

            o canceling

            o complete

            o failed

            o in_progress

            o starting

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a  later  DescribeExportTasks
          request. A marker is used for pagination to identify the location to
          begin output for the next response of DescribeExportTasks .

                 o database.table   table-name  -  Export a table of the snap-
                   shot. This format is valid only for RDS for MySQL, RDS  for
                   MariaDB, and Aurora MySQL.

                 o database.schema   schema-name - Export a database schema of

                 (string)

              SnapshotTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the snapshot was created.

                 the exported snapshot.

              IamRoleArn -> (string)
                 The name of the IAM role that is used to write to  Amazon  S3

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The key identifier of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is
                 used to encrypt the snapshot when it's exported to Amazon S3.
                 The  KMS key identifier is its key ARN, key ID, alias ARN, or
                 alias name. The IAM role used for the  snapshot  export  must
                 have  encryption  and  decryption permissions to use this KMS
