MODIFY-CURRENT-DB-CLUSTER-CAPACITY()      MODIFY-CURRENT-DB-CLUSTER-CAPACITY()



NAME
       modify-current-db-cluster-capacity -

DESCRIPTION
       Set  the  capacity  of  an  Aurora  Serverless DB cluster to a specific
       value.

       Aurora Serverless scales seamlessly based on the  workload  on  the  DB
       cluster.  In  some  cases,  the capacity might not scale fast enough to
       meet a sudden change in workload, such as a large number of new  trans-
       actions.  Call  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity  to set the capacity ex-
       plicitly.

       After this call sets the DB cluster capacity, Aurora Serverless can au-
       tomatically scale the DB cluster based on the cooldown period for scal-
       ing up and the cooldown period for scaling down.

       For more information about Aurora Serverless, see Using  Amazon  Aurora
       Serverless in the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       WARNING:
          If  you  call  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity with the default Time-
          outAction , connections that prevent Aurora Serverless from  finding
          a scaling point might be dropped. For more information about scaling
          points, see Autoscaling for Aurora Serverless in the  Amazon  Aurora
          User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora Serverless DB clusters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-current-db-cluster-capacity
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--capacity <value>]
          [--seconds-before-timeout <value>]
          [--timeout-action <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster identifier for the cluster being modified. This pa-
          rameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DB cluster.

       --capacity (integer)
          The DB cluster capacity.

          When you change the capacity of a paused Aurora Serverless DB  clus-
          ter, it automatically resumes.

          Constraints:

          o For  Aurora  MySQL, valid capacity values are 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ,
            32 , 64 , 128 , and 256 .

          o For Aurora PostgreSQL, valid capacity values are 2 , 4 , 8 , 16  ,
            32 , 64 , 192 , and 384 .

       --seconds-before-timeout (integer)
          The amount of time, in seconds, that Aurora Serverless tries to find
          a scaling point to perform seamless  scaling  before  enforcing  the
          timeout action. The default is 300.

          Specify a value between 10 and 600 seconds.

       --timeout-action (string)
          The action to take when the timeout is reached, either ForceApplyCa-
          pacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
              ForceApplyCapacityChange , the default, sets the capacity to the
              specified value as soon as possible.

              RollbackCapacityChange  ignores the capacity change if a scaling
              point isn't found in the timeout period.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To scale the capacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster

       The following modify-current-db-cluster-capacity example scales the ca-
       pacity of an Aurora Serverless DB cluster to 8.

          aws rds modify-current-db-cluster-capacity \
              --db-cluster-identifier mydbcluster \
              --capacity 8

       Output:

          {
              "DBClusterIdentifier": "mydbcluster",
              "PendingCapacity": 8,
              "CurrentCapacity": 1,
              "SecondsBeforeTimeout": 300,
              "TimeoutAction": "ForceApplyCapacityChange"
          }

       For  more  information, see Scaling Aurora Serverless v1 DB cluster ca-
       pacity manually in the Amazon Aurora User Guide.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          A user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier is the unique
          key that identifies a DB cluster.

       PendingCapacity -> (integer)
          A  value  that  specifies the capacity that the DB cluster scales to
          next.

       CurrentCapacity -> (integer)
          The current capacity of the DB cluster.

       SecondsBeforeTimeout -> (integer)
          The number of seconds before a call to  ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapac-
          ity times out.

       TimeoutAction -> (string)
          The timeout action of a call to ModifyCurrentDBClusterCapacity , ei-
          ther ForceApplyCapacityChange or RollbackCapacityChange .
