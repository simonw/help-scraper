DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to  DB  instances,  DB clusters, DB parameter
       groups, DB security groups, DB snapshots, DB cluster snapshots, and RDS
       Proxies  for  the  past 14 days. Events specific to a particular DB in-
       stance, DB cluster, DB parameter group, DB security group, DB snapshot,
       DB  cluster  snapshot  group, or RDS Proxy can be obtained by providing
       the name as a parameter.

       NOTE:
          By default, RDS returns events that were generated in the past hour.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, then all sources are included in the response.

          Constraints:

          o If SourceIdentifier is supplied, SourceType must also be provided.

            supplied.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --source-type (string)
          The  event  source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o db-instance

          o db-parameter-group

          o db-security-group

          o db-snapshot

          o db-cluster

          o db-cluster-snapshot

          o custom-engine-version

          o db-proxy

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in  ISO  8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in  ISO  8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes to retrieve events for.

          Default: 60

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories that trigger notifications  for  a  event
          notification subscription.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          This parameter isn't currently supported.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results from a describe operation. Filters can  be
              used  to  match a set of resources by specific criteria, such as
              IDs. The filters supported by a  describe  operation  are  docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe events

       The following describe-events example retrieves details for the  events
       that have occurred for the specified DB instance.

                          "backup"
                      ],
                      "Message": "Finished DB Instance backup",
                      "Date": "2018-07-31T23:15:13.049Z",
                      "SourceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:test-instance"
                  }
