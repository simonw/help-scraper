DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()              DESCRIBE-DB-CLUSTER-BACKTRACKS()



NAME
       describe-db-cluster-backtracks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about backtracks for a DB cluster.

       For  more  information  on Amazon Aurora, see What is Amazon Aurora? in
       the Amazon Aurora User Guide .

       NOTE:
          This action only applies to Aurora MySQL DB clusters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-db-cluster-backtracks is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterBacktracks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-db-cluster-backtracks
          --db-cluster-identifier <value>
          [--backtrack-identifier <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  DB  cluster  identifier of the DB cluster to be described. This
          parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 alphanumeric characters or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster1

       --backtrack-identifier (string)
          If specified, this value is the backtrack identifier  of  the  back-
          track to be described.

          Constraints:

          o Must  contain  a  valid  universally unique identifier (UUID). For
            more information about UUIDs, see A Universally Unique  Identifier
            (UUID) URN Namespace .

          Example: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000

       --filters (list)
          A  filter  that  specifies one or more DB clusters to describe. Sup-
          ported filters include the following:

          o db-cluster-backtrack-id - Accepts backtrack identifiers.  The  re-
            sults  list includes information about only the backtracks identi-
            fied by these identifiers.

          o db-cluster-backtrack-status - Accepts any of the  following  back-
            track status values:

            o applying

            o completed

            o failed

            o pending

          The  results  list  includes  information  about only the backtracks
          identified by these values.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific  list of results from a describe operation. Filters can be
              used to match a set of resources by specific criteria,  such  as
              IDs.  The  filters  supported  by a describe operation are docu-
              mented with the describe operation.

              NOTE:
                 Currently, wildcards are not supported in filters.

              The following actions can be filtered:

              o DescribeDBClusterBacktracks

              o DescribeDBClusterEndpoints

              o DescribeDBClusters

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribePendingMaintenanceActions

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter. Filter names are case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 One or more filter values. Filter values are case-sensitive.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in  a  later  DescribeDBCluster-
          Backtracks request.

       DBClusterBacktracks -> (list)
          Contains a list of backtracks for the user.

          (structure)
              This  data type is used as a response element in the DescribeDB-
              ClusterBacktracks action.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identi-
                 fier is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

              BacktrackIdentifier -> (string)
                 Contains the backtrack identifier.

              BacktrackTo -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of the time to which the DB cluster was back-
                 tracked.

              BacktrackedFrom -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the time from which the DB cluster was back-
                 tracked.

              BacktrackRequestCreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  timestamp  of  the  time  at which the backtrack was re-
                 quested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the backtrack. This property returns one of the
                 following values:

                 o applying  -  The backtrack is currently being applied to or
                   rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o completed - The backtrack has successfully been applied  to
                   or rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o failed  - An error occurred while the backtrack was applied
                   to or rolled back from the DB cluster.

                 o pending - The backtrack is currently pending application to
                   or rollback from the DB cluster.
