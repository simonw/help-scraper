NAME
       create-db-instance-read-replica -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new DB instance that acts as a read replica for an existing
       source DB instance. You can create a read replica  for  a  DB  instance
       running MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server. For more in-
       formation, see Working with Read Replicas in the Amazon RDS User  Guide
       .

       Amazon Aurora doesn't support this operation. Call the CreateDBInstance
       operation to create a DB instance for an Aurora DB cluster.

       All read replica DB instances are created with  backups  disabled.  All
       other  DB  instance attributes (including DB security groups and DB pa-
       rameter groups) are inherited from the source DB  instance,  except  as
       specified.

       WARNING:
          Your source DB instance must have backup retention enabled.

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance identifier of the read replica. This identifier is
          the unique key that identifies a  DB  instance.  This  parameter  is
          stored as a lowercase string.

       --source-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  identifier  of  the DB instance that will act as the source for
          the read replica. Each DB instance can have up to five  read  repli-
          cas.

          Constraints:

          o Must  be  the  identifier  of  an existing MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle,
            PostgreSQL, or SQL Server DB instance.

          o Can specify a DB instance that is a MySQL read replica only if the
            source is running MySQL 5.6 or later.

          o For the limitations of Oracle read replicas, see Read Replica Lim-
            itations with Oracle in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          o For the limitations of SQL Server read replicas, see Read  Replica
            Limitations with Microsoft SQL Server in the Amazon RDS User Guide
            .

          o Can specify a PostgreSQL DB instance only if the source is running
            PostgreSQL  9.3.5  or  later  (9.4.7  and  higher for cross-Region
            replication).

          o The specified DB instance must  have  automatic  backups  enabled,
            that is, its backup retention period must be greater than 0.

          o If  the  source DB instance is in the same Amazon Web Services Re-
            gion as the read replica, specify a valid DB instance identifier.

          o If the source DB instance is in a different  Amazon  Web  Services
            Region from the read replica, specify a valid DB instance ARN. For
            more information, see Constructing an ARN for Amazon  RDS  in  the
            Amazon  RDS  User  Guide . This doesn't apply to SQL Server or RDS
            Custom, which don't support cross-Region replicas.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The compute and memory capacity of the  read  replica,  for  example
          db.m4.large. Not all DB instance classes are available in all Amazon
          Web Services Regions, or for all database engines. For the full list
          of DB instance classes, and availability for your engine, see DB In-
          stance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance.

       --availability-zone (string)
          The Availability Zone (AZ) where the read replica will be created.

          Default: A random, system-chosen Availability Zone in the endpoint's
          Amazon Web Services Region.

          Example: us-east-1d

       --port (integer)
          The port number that the DB instance uses for connections.

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance

          Valid Values: 1150-65535

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the read replica is in a Multi-AZ de-
          ployment.

          You can create a read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance. RDS creates
          a  standby of your replica in another Availability Zone for failover
          support for the replica. Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB
          instance is independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ
          DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade  (bool-
       ean)
          A value that indicates whether minor engine upgrades are applied au-
          tomatically to the read replica during the maintenance window.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default: Inherits from the source DB instance

       --iops (integer)
          The amount of Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per  second)
          to be initially allocated for the DB instance.

       --option-group-name (string)
          The option group the DB instance is associated with. If omitted, the
          option group associated with the source instance is used.

          NOTE:
              For SQL Server, you must use the option  group  associated  with
              the source instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  DB parameter group to associate with this DB in-
          stance.

          If you do not specify a value for DBParameterGroupName , then Amazon
          RDS  uses  the DBParameterGroup of source DB instance for a same Re-
          gion read replica, or the default DBParameterGroup for the specified
          DB engine for a cross-Region read replica.

          Specifying  a  parameter  group for this operation is only supported
          for MySQL and Oracle DB instances. It isn't supported for  RDS  Cus-
          tom.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

       --publicly-accessible | --no-publicly-accessible (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance is publicly accessi-
          ble.

          When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain  Name  System
          (DNS) endpoint resolves to the private IP address from within the DB
          cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves to the public  IP
          address from outside of the DB cluster's VPC. Access to the DB clus-
          ter is ultimately controlled by the security  group  it  uses.  That
          public  access isn't permitted if the security group assigned to the
          DB cluster doesn't permit it.

          When the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an internal DB
          instance with a DNS name that resolves to a private IP address.

          For more information, see  CreateDBInstance .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags.  For more information, see Tagging Amazon RDS Re-
          sources in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon  RDS  resource  consisting  of  a
              key-value pair.

              For  more  information,  see Tagging Amazon RDS Resources in the
              Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain only
                 the  set  of  Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_', '.',
                 ':',   '/',    '=',    '+',    '-',    '@'    (Java    regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 only the set of Unicode letters,  digits,  white-space,  '_',
                 '.',   ':',   '/',   '=',   '+',   '-',   '@'   (Java  regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-@]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          Specifies a DB subnet group for the DB instance. The new DB instance
          is  created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If no DB
          subnet group is specified, then the new DB instance isn't created in
          a VPC.

          Constraints:

          o Can  only be specified if the source DB instance identifier speci-
            fies a DB instance in another Amazon Web Services Region.

          o If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSubnetGroup.

          o The specified DB subnet group must be in the same Amazon Web  Ser-
            vices Region in which the operation is running.

          o All  read replicas in one Amazon Web Services Region that are cre-
            ated from the same source DB instance must either:>

            o Specify DB subnet groups from  the  same  VPC.  All  these  read
              replicas are created in the same VPC.

            o Not  specify a DB subnet group. All these read replicas are cre-
              ated outside of any VPC.

          Example: mydbsubnetgroup

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of Amazon EC2 VPC security groups to associate with the  read
          replica.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Default:  The  default  EC2  VPC  security  group  for the DB subnet
          group's VPC.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the read replica.

          Valid values: gp2 | gp3 | io1 | standard

          If you specify io1 or gp3 , you must also include a  value  for  the
          Iops parameter.

          Default: io1 if the Iops parameter is specified, otherwise gp2

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          A  value  that  indicates  whether  to  copy  all tags from the read
          replica to snapshots of the read replica. By default, tags  are  not
          copied.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the read replica.  To  disable  collecting
          Enhanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If  MonitoringRoleArn  is  specified,  then  you must also set Moni-
          toringInterval to a value other than 0.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The ARN for the IAM role that permits RDS to send enhanced  monitor-
          ing    metrics    to    Amazon   CloudWatch   Logs.   For   example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess . For information on creating
          a  monitoring  role,  go to To create an IAM role for Amazon RDS En-
          hanced Monitoring in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          If MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you  must
          supply a MonitoringRoleArn value.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  KMS key identifier for an encrypted read
          replica.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If  you create an encrypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region as the source DB instance, then do not specify a  value
          for  this  parameter. A read replica in the same Amazon Web Services
          Region is always encrypted with the same KMS key as  the  source  DB
          instance.

          If  you  create  an encrypted read replica in a different Amazon Web
          Services Region, then you must specify a KMS key identifier for  the
          destination Amazon Web Services Region. KMS keys are specific to the
          Amazon Web Services Region that they are created in, and  you  can't
          use  KMS  keys from one Amazon Web Services Region in another Amazon
          Web Services Region.

          You can't create an encrypted read replica from  an  unencrypted  DB
          instance.

          This  setting  doesn't  apply to RDS Custom, which uses the same KMS
          key as the primary replica.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          When you are creating a read replica from one  Amazon  Web  Services
          GovCloud  (US)  Region  to another or from one China Amazon Web Ser-
          vices Region to another, the URL that contains a Signature Version 4
          signed  request for the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica API operation in
          the source Amazon Web Services Region that contains  the  source  DB
          instance.

          This  setting  applies only to Amazon Web Services GovCloud (US) Re-
          gions and China Amazon Web Services Regions. It's ignored  in  other
          Amazon Web Services Regions.

          You  must  specify  this parameter when you create an encrypted read
          replica from another Amazon Web Services Region by using the  Amazon
          RDS  API.  Don't  specify  PreSignedUrl when you are creating an en-
          crypted read replica in the same Amazon Web Services Region.

          The presigned URL must  be  a  valid  request  for  the  CreateDBIn-
          stanceReadReplica  API  operation  that can run in the source Amazon
          Web Services Region that contains the encrypted source DB  instance.
          The  presigned URL request must contain the following parameter val-
          ues:

          o DestinationRegion - The Amazon Web Services Region  that  the  en-
            crypted  read  replica is created in. This Amazon Web Services Re-
            gion is the same one where the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica  opera-
            tion  is  called that contains this presigned URL. For example, if
            you create an encrypted DB instance in the  us-west-1  Amazon  Web
            Services Region, from a source DB instance in the us-east-2 Amazon
            Web Services Region, then you call the CreateDBInstanceReadReplica
            operation  in the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region and provide
            a presigned URL that contains a call to the  CreateDBInstanceRead-
            Replica operation in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Services Region. For
            this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL  must  be
            set to the us-east-1 Amazon Web Services Region.

          o KmsKeyId  -  The  KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt
            the read replica in the destination Amazon  Web  Services  Region.
            This  is  the  same  identifier for both the CreateDBInstanceRead-
            Replica operation that is called in  the  destination  Amazon  Web
            Services Region, and the operation contained in the presigned URL.

          o SourceDBInstanceIdentifier  -  The  DB instance identifier for the
            encrypted DB instance to be replicated. This identifier must be in
            the  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) format for the source Amazon Web
            Services Region. For example, if you  are  creating  an  encrypted
            read  replica  from a DB instance in the us-west-2 Amazon Web Ser-
            vices Region, then your SourceDBInstanceIdentifier looks like  the
            following      example:     arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:in-
            stance:mysql-instance1-20161115 .

          To learn how to generate a Signature Version 4 signed  request,  see
          Authenticating Requests: Using Query Parameters (Amazon Web Services
          Signature Version 4) and Signature Version 4 Signing Process .

          NOTE:
              If you are using an Amazon Web Services SDK tool or the CLI, you
              can  specify  SourceRegion  (or --source-region for the CLI) in-
              stead of specifying PreSignedUrl manually. Specifying  SourceRe-
              gion  autogenerates  a presigned URL that is a valid request for
              the operation that can run in the source Amazon Web Services Re-
              gion.
                 SourceRegion  isn't  supported for SQL Server, because Amazon
                 RDS for SQL Server doesn't support cross-Region  read  repli-
                 cas.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable mapping of Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices  Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
          counts. By default, mapping isn't enabled.

          For more information about  IAM  database  authentication,  see  IAM
          Database  Authentication  for MySQL and PostgreSQL in the Amazon RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          A  value  that  indicates whether to enable Performance Insights for
          the read replica.

          For more information, see Using Amazon Performance Insights  in  the

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier for encryption of Perfor-
          mance Insights data.

          The Amazon Web Services KMS key identifier is the key ARN,  key  ID,
          alias ARN, or alias name for the KMS key.

          If you do not specify a value for PerformanceInsightsKMSKeyId , then
          Amazon RDS uses your default KMS key. There is a default KMS key for
          your  Amazon  Web Services account. Your Amazon Web Services account
          has a different default KMS key for each Amazon Web Services Region.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --performance-insights-retention-period (integer)
          The number of days to retain Performance Insights data. The  default
          is 7 days. The following values are valid:

          o 7

          o month * 31, where month is a number of months from 1-23

          o 731

          For example, the following values are valid:

          o 93 (3 months * 31)

          o 341 (11 months * 31)

          o 589 (19 months * 31)

          o 731

          If  you  specify  a retention period such as 94, which isn't a valid
          value, RDS issues an error.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of logs that the new DB instance is to export to CloudWatch
          Logs. The values in the list depend on the DB engine being used. For
          more information, see Publishing Database Logs to Amazon  CloudWatch
          Logs in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --processor-features (list)
          The  number  of CPU cores and the number of threads per core for the
          DB instance class of the DB instance.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

          (structure)
              Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

              To specify the number of CPU cores, use  the  coreCount  feature
              name  for  the  Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
              per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name for the  Name  pa-
              rameter.

              You  can set the processor features of the DB instance class for
              a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

              o CreateDBInstance

              o ModifyDBInstance

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

              o RestoreDBInstanceFromS3

              o RestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime

              You can view the valid processor values  for  a  particular  in-
              stance  class  by calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOptions
              action and specifying the instance class for the DBInstanceClass
              parameter.

              In  addition,  you can use the following actions for DB instance
              class processor information:

              o DescribeDBInstances

              o DescribeDBSnapshots

              o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

              If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
              non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

              o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

              o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the number
                of CPU cores and threads per core.

              o The current number CPU cores and threads is set to  a  non-de-
                fault value.

              For  more  information,  see Configuring the Processor of the DB
              Instance Class in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the processor feature. Valid names are  coreCount
                 and threadsPerCore .

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of a processor feature name.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --use-default-processor-features  | --no-use-default-processor-features
       (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance class of the  DB  in-
          stance uses its default processor features.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A  value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is  enabled. By default, deletion protection isn't enabled. For more
          information, see Deleting a DB Instance .

       --domain (string)
          The Active Directory directory ID to create the DB instance in. Cur-
          rently,  only MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB
          instances can be created in an Active Directory Domain.

          For more information, see Kerberos Authentication in the Amazon  RDS
          User Guide .

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to
          the Directory Service.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom.

       --replica-mode (string)
          The open mode of the replica database: mounted or read-only.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is only supported for Oracle DB instances.

          Mounted DB replicas are included in Oracle Database Enterprise  Edi-
          tion.  The main use case for mounted replicas is cross-Region disas-
          ter recovery. The primary database doesn't use Active Data Guard  to
          transmit  information to the mounted replica. Because it doesn't ac-
          cept user connections, a mounted replica  can't  serve  a  read-only
          workload.

          You  can  create  a combination of mounted and read-only DB replicas
          for the same primary DB instance. For more information, see  Working
          with  Oracle  Read  Replicas  for  Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User
          Guide .

          For RDS Custom, you must  specify  this  parameter  and  set  it  to
          mounted . The value won't be set by default. After replica creation,
          you can manage the open mode manually.

          Possible values:

          o open-read-only

          o mounted

       --max-allocated-storage (integer)
          The upper limit in gibibytes (GiB) to which Amazon RDS can automati-
          cally scale the storage of the DB instance.

          For  more information about this setting, including limitations that
          apply to it, see Managing capacity  automatically  with  Amazon  RDS
          storage autoscaling in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

       --custom-iam-instance-profile (string)
          The  instance  profile associated with the underlying Amazon EC2 in-
          stance of an RDS Custom DB instance. The instance profile must  meet
          the following requirements:

          o The profile must exist in your account.

          o The  profile must have an IAM role that Amazon EC2 has permissions
            to assume.

          o The instance profile name and the associated IAM  role  name  must
            start with the prefix AWSRDSCustom .

          For the list of permissions required for the IAM role, see Configure
          IAM and your VPC in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          This setting is required for RDS Custom.

       --network-type (string)
          The network type of the DB instance.

          Valid values:

          o IPV4

          o DUAL

          The network type is determined by the  DBSubnetGroup  specified  for
          read  replica. A DBSubnetGroup can support only the IPv4 protocol or
          the IPv4 and the IPv6 protocols (DUAL ).

          For more information, see Working with a DB instance in a VPC in the
          Amazon RDS User Guide.

       --storage-throughput (integer)
          Specifies the storage throughput value for the read replica.

          This setting doesn't apply to RDS Custom or Amazon Aurora.

       --enable-customer-owned-ip | --no-enable-customer-owned-ip (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether to enable a customer-owned IP address
          (CoIP) for an RDS on Outposts read replica.

          A CoIP provides local or external connectivity to resources in  your
          Outpost  subnets  through  your  on-premises  network.  For some use
          cases, a CoIP can provide lower latency for connections to the  read
          replica  from outside of its virtual private cloud (VPC) on your lo-
          cal network.

          For more information about RDS on Outposts, see Working with  Amazon
          RDS on Amazon Web Services Outposts in the Amazon RDS User Guide .

          For more information about CoIPs, see Customer-owned IP addresses in
          the Amazon Web Services Outposts User Guide .

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          The amount of storage (in gibibytes) to allocate initially  for  the
          read  replica.  Follow the allocation rules specified in CreateDBIn-
          stance .

          NOTE:
              Be sure to allocate enough memory for your read replica so  that
              the  create  operation  can succeed. You can also allocate addi-
              tional memory for future growth.

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the read replica.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

                     ber of threads per core, use the  threadsPerCore  feature
                     name for the Name parameter.

                     You  can  set  the  processor features of the DB instance
                     class for a DB instance when you call one of the  follow-
                     ing actions:

                     o CreateDBInstance

                     o ModifyDBInstance

                     o DescribeDBSnapshots

                     o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                     If  you  call  DescribeDBInstances , ProcessorFeature re-
                     turns non-null values only if  the  following  conditions
                     are met:

                     o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                     o Your  Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the
                       number of CPU cores and threads per core.

                     o The current number CPU cores and threads is  set  to  a
                       non-default value.

              When the DB cluster is publicly accessible, its Domain Name Sys-
              tem (DNS) endpoint resolves  to  the  private  IP  address  from
              within the DB cluster's virtual private cloud (VPC). It resolves
              to the public IP address from outside of the DB  cluster's  VPC.
              Access  to  the DB cluster is ultimately controlled by the secu-
              rity group it uses. That public access isn't  permitted  if  the
              security group assigned to the DB cluster doesn't permit it.

              When  the DB instance isn't publicly accessible, it is an inter-
              nal DB instance with a DNS name that resolves to  a  private  IP
              address.

                 Contains the processor features of a DB instance class.

                 To specify the number of CPU cores, use the coreCount feature
                 name for the Name parameter. To specify the number of threads
                 per core, use the threadsPerCore feature name  for  the  Name
                 parameter.

                 You  can  set the processor features of the DB instance class
                 for a DB instance when you call one of the following actions:

                 o CreateDBInstance

                 o ModifyDBInstance

                 o RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot

                 You can view the valid processor values for a particular  in-
                 stance  class  by  calling the DescribeOrderableDBInstanceOp-
                 tions action and specifying the instance class for the  DBIn-
                 stanceClass parameter.

                 o DescribeDBSnapshots

                 o DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications

                 If you call DescribeDBInstances  ,  ProcessorFeature  returns
                 non-null values only if the following conditions are met:

                 o You are accessing an Oracle DB instance.

                 o Your Oracle DB instance class supports configuring the num-
                   ber of CPU cores and threads per core.

                 o The current number CPU  cores  and  threads  is  set  to  a
                   non-default value.

                   dentials, but it can't be rotated. A secret might have this
                   status if, for example, permissions are changed so that RDS
                   can  no  longer access either the secret or the KMS key for
                   the secret. When a secret has this status, you can  correct
                   the condition that caused the status. Alternatively, modify
                   the DB instance to turn off automatic management  of  data-
                   base  credentials, and then modify the DB instance again to
                   turn on automatic management of database credentials.
