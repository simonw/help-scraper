GET-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()                                GET-ENROLLMENT-STATUS()



NAME
       get-enrollment-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the enrollment (opt in) status of an account to the Compute Op-
       timizer service.

       If the account is the management account of an organization,  this  ac-
       tion  also confirms the enrollment status of member accounts of the or-
       ganization. Use the  GetEnrollmentStatusesForOrganization action to get
       detailed  information about the enrollment status of member accounts of
       an organization.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-enrollment-status
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       status -> (string)
          The enrollment status of the account.

       statusReason -> (string)
          The reason for the enrollment status of the account.

          For  example, an account might show a status of Pending because mem-
          ber accounts of an organization require more time to be enrolled  in
          the service.

       memberAccountsEnrolled -> (boolean)
          Confirms  the  enrollment status of member accounts of the organiza-
          tion, if the account is a management account of an organization.

       lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, of when the account enrollment
          status was last updated.

       numberOfMemberAccountsOptedIn -> (integer)
          The  count  of organization member accounts that are opted in to the
          service, if your account is an organization management account.
