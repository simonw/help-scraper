SYNOPSIS
            get-lambda-function-recommendations
          [--function-arns <value>]
          [--account-ids <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --function-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the functions for which to return
          recommendations.

          You can specify a qualified or unqualified ARN. If  you  specify  an
          unqualified ARN without a function version suffix, Compute Optimizer
          will return recommendations for the latest ($LATEST ) version of the
          function. If you specify a qualified ARN with a version suffix, Com-
          pute Optimizer will return recommendations for the  specified  func-
          tion  version.  For  more information about using function versions,
          see Using versions in the Lambda Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --account-ids (list)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return  func-
          tion recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          return function recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of function recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list  of  Lambda
              function  recommendations.  Use this filter with the  GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action.

              You can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations  ac-
              tion,  JobFilter  with the  DescribeRecommendationExportJobs ac-
              tion, and Filter  with  the   GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
              and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

                 Specify FindingReasonCode to return  recommendations  with  a
                 specific  finding reason code (for example, MemoryUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o Specify  Optimized  ,  NotOptimized , or Unavailable if you
                   specify the name parameter as Finding .

                 o Specify MemoryOverprovisioned  ,  MemoryUnderprovisioned  ,
                   InsufficientData  , or Inconclusive if you specify the name
                   parameter as FindingReasonCode .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Finding"|"FindingReasonCode",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of function recommendations.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of function recommendations to return with a sin-
          gle request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to advance to the next page of function recommenda-
          tions.

          mendations to return.

       lambdaFunctionRecommendations -> (list)

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the utilization metric.

                        The following utilization metrics are available:

                        o Duration - The amount of  time  that  your  function

                        The  Compute  Optimizer  API,  Command  Line Interface
                        (CLI), and SDKs return utilization metrics using  only
                        the  Maximum statistic, which is the highest value ob-
                        served during the specified period.

                        The Compute Optimizer console displays graphs for some
                        utilization metrics using the Average statistic, which
                        is the value of Sum / SampleCount during the specified

                        recommendations in the Compute Optimizer User Guide  .
                        You  can also get averaged utilization metric data for
                        your resources using Amazon CloudWatch. For  more  in-
                        formation, see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                 generated.

              finding -> (string)
                 The finding classification of the function.

                 Findings for functions include:

                 o

                   **
                   Optimized  **  The function is correctly provisioned to run
                   your workload based on its current  configuration  and  its
                   utilization  history.  This finding classification does not
                   include finding reason codes.

                 o

                   **
                   NotOptimized **  The function is  performing  at  a  higher
                   level  (over-provisioned) or at a lower level (under-provi-
                   sioned) than required for your workload because its current
                   configuration  is  not  optimal. Over-provisioned resources
                   might lead to  unnecessary  infrastructure  cost,  and  un-
                   der-provisioned  resources  might  lead to poor application
                   performance. This finding classification  can  include  the
                   MemoryUnderprovisioned  and  MemoryUnderprovisioned finding
                   reason codes.

                   Unavailable **  Compute Optimizer was unable to generate  a
                   recommendation  for the function. This could be because the
                   function has not accumulated sufficient metric data, or the
                   function  does not qualify for a recommendation. This find-
                   ing classification can include the InsufficientData and In-
                   conclusive finding reason codes.

                 NOTE:
                     Functions  with a finding of unavailable are not returned
                     unless you specify the filter parameter with a  value  of
                     Unavailable  in your GetLambdaFunctionRecommendations re-
                     quest.

              findingReasonCodes -> (list)
                 The reason for the finding classification of the function.

                 NOTE:
                     Functions that have a finding classification of Optimized
                     don't have a finding reason code.

                   MemoryOverprovisioned  **  The function is over-provisioned
                   when its memory configuration can be sized down while still
                   meeting  the  performance requirements of your workload. An
                   over-provisioned function might lead to unnecessary  infra-
                   structure cost. This finding reason code is part of the No-
