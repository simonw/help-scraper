NAME
       get-lambda-function-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns Lambda function recommendations.

       Compute  Optimizer  generates recommendations for functions that meet a
       specific set of requirements. For more information, see  the  Supported
       resources and requirements in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-lambda-function-recommendations  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: lambdaFunctionRecommendations

OPTIONS
       --function-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the functions for which to  return
          recommendations.

          You  can  specify  a qualified or unqualified ARN. If you specify an
          unqualified ARN without a function version suffix, Compute Optimizer
          will return recommendations for the latest ($LATEST ) version of the
          function. If you specify a qualified ARN with a version suffix, Com-
          pute  Optimizer  will return recommendations for the specified func-
          tion version. For more information about  using  function  versions,
          see Using versions in the Lambda Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --account-ids (list)
          The  ID of the Amazon Web Services account for which to return func-
          tion recommendations.

          If your account is the management account of  an  organization,  use
          this  parameter  to specify the member account for which you want to
          return function recommendations.

          Only one account ID can be specified per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of function recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Lambda
              function recommendations. Use this filter with  the   GetLambda-
              FunctionRecommendations action.

              You  can use EBSFilter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations ac-
              tion, JobFilter with the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  ac-
              tion,  and  Filter  with the  GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations
              and  GetEC2InstanceRecommendations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Finding to return  recommendations  with  a  specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

                 Specify  FindingReasonCode  to  return recommendations with a
                 specific finding reason code (for example,  MemoryUnderprovi-
                 sioned ).

                 You  can  filter  your  Lambda  function  recommendations  by
                 tag:key and tag-key tags.

                 A tag:key is a key and value combination of a tag assigned to
                 your  Lambda function recommendations. Use the tag key in the
                 filter name and the tag value as the filter value. For  exam-
                 ple,  to find all Lambda function recommendations that have a
                 tag with the key of Owner and the value of  TeamA  ,  specify
                 tag:Owner for the filter name and TeamA for the filter value.

                 A  tag-key  is the key of a tag assigned to your Lambda func-
                 tion recommendations. Use this filter to  find  all  of  your
                 Lambda  function  recommendations that have a tag with a spe-
                 cific key. This doesnt consider the tag value.  For  example,
                 you  can find your Lambda function recommendations with a tag
                 key value of Owner or without any tag keys assigned.

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values for this parameter are as follows, depending
                 on what you specify for the name parameter:

                 o Specify  Optimized  ,  NotOptimized , or Unavailable if you
                   specify the name parameter as Finding .

                 o Specify MemoryOverprovisioned  ,  MemoryUnderprovisioned  ,
                   InsufficientData  , or Inconclusive if you specify the name
                   parameter as FindingReasonCode .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Finding"|"FindingReasonCode",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              finding -> (string)
                 The finding classification of the function.

                 Findings for functions include:

                 o

                   **
                   Optimized **  The function is correctly provisioned to  run
                   your  workload  based  on its current configuration and its
                   utilization history. This finding classification  does  not
                   include finding reason codes.

                        tion.

                        (structure)
                            Describes  a  projected  utilization  metric of an
                            Lambda function recommendation option.

                            name -> (string)
                               The name of the projected utilization metric.

                            statistic -> (string)
                               The statistic of the projected utilization met-
                               ric.

                            value -> (double)
                               The  values  of  the projected utilization met-
                               rics.

                     savingsOpportunity -> (structure)
                        An object that describes the savings  opportunity  for
                        the Lambda function recommendation option. Savings op-
                        portunity  includes  the  estimated  monthly   savings
                        amount and percentage.

                        savingsOpportunityPercentage -> (double)
                            The  estimated  monthly savings possible as a per-
                            centage of monthly cost by adopting Compute  Opti-
                            mizer recommendations for a given resource.

                        estimatedMonthlySavings -> (structure)
                            An  object  that  describes  the estimated monthly
                            savings amount possible by adopting Compute  Opti-
                            mizer  recommendations  for a given resource. This
                            is based on the On-Demand instance pricing..

                            currency -> (string)
                               The currency of the estimated monthly savings.

                            value -> (double)
                               The value of the estimated monthly savings.

              currentPerformanceRisk -> (string)
                 The risk of the current Lambda function not meeting the  per-
                 formance  needs  of  its  workloads. The higher the risk, the
                 more likely the current Lambda function requires more memory.

              tags -> (list)
                 A list of tags assigned to your Lambda  function  recommenda-
                 tions.

                 (structure)
                     A list of tag key and value pairs that you define.

                     key -> (string)
                        One  part  of  a key-value pair that makes up a tag. A
                        key is a general label that acts like a  category  for
                        more specific tag values.

                     value -> (string)
                        One  part  of  a  key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                        value acts as  a  descriptor  within  a  tag  category
                        (key). The value can be empty or null.
