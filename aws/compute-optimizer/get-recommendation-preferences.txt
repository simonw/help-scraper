DESCRIPTION
       Returns  existing  recommendation  preferences, such as enhanced infra-
       structure metrics.

       Use the scope parameter to specify which preferences to return. You can
       specify  to  return preferences for an organization, a specific account
       ID, or a specific EC2 instance or Auto Scaling  group  Amazon  Resource
       Name (ARN).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-recommendation-preferences
          --resource-type <value>
          [--scope <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The target resource type of the recommendation preference for  which
          to return preferences.

          The  Ec2Instance  option  encompasses  standalone  instances and in-
          stances that are part of Auto Scaling groups.  The  AutoScalingGroup
          option  encompasses  only instances that are part of an Auto Scaling
          group.

          Possible values:

          o Ec2Instance

          o AutoScalingGroup

          o EbsVolume

          o LambdaFunction

          o NotApplicable

       --scope (structure)
          An object that describes the scope of the recommendation  preference
          to return.

          You  can  return  recommendation preferences that are created at the
          organization level  (for  management  accounts  of  an  organization
          only),  account level, and resource level. For more information, see
          Activating enhanced infrastructure metrics in the Compute  Optimizer
          User Guide .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the scope.

              The following scopes are possible:

              o Organization  -  Specifies  that the recommendation preference
                applies at the organization level, for all member accounts  of
                an organization.

              o AccountId  -  Specifies that the recommendation preference ap-
                plies at the account level, for all resources of a  given  re-
                source type in an account.

              o ResourceArn - Specifies that the recommendation preference ap-
                plies at the individual resource level.

          value -> (string)
              The value of the scope.

              If you specified the name of the scope as:

              o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

              o AccountId - The value must be a 12-digit Amazon  Web  Services
                account ID.

              o ResourceArn - The value must be the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

              Only EC2 instance and Auto Scaling group ARNs are currently sup-
              ported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "Organization"|"AccountId"|"ResourceArn",
            "value": "string"
          }

       --next-token (string)
          The token to advance to the next page of recommendation preferences.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of recommendation preferences to return with a
          single request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to advance to the next page of recommendation pref-
          erences.

          This value is null when there are no more  pages  of  recommendation
          preferences to return.

       recommendationPreferencesDetails -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe recommendation preferences.

          (structure)
              Describes a recommendation preference.

              scope -> (structure)
                 An  object  that  describes  the  scope of the recommendation
                 preference.

                 Recommendation preferences can be created at the organization
                 level  (for management accounts of an organization only), ac-
                 count level, and resource level. For  more  information,  see

                     o AccountId - Specifies that the  recommendation  prefer-
                       ence applies at the account level, for all resources of
                       a given resource type in an account.

                     o ResourceArn - Specifies that the recommendation prefer-

                 value -> (string)
                     The value of the scope.

                     If you specified the name of the scope as:

                     o Organization - The value must be ALL_ACCOUNTS .

                       Name (ARN) of an EC2 instance or an Auto Scaling group.

                     Only  EC2  instance  and Auto Scaling group ARNs are cur-

                 The target resource type of the recommendation preference  to
                 create.

                 The  Ec2Instance  option encompasses standalone instances and
                 instances that are part of Auto Scaling groups. The AutoScal-
                 ingGroup  option  encompasses only instances that are part of
                 an Auto Scaling group.

              enhancedInfrastructureMetrics -> (string)
                 The status of the enhanced infrastructure metrics recommenda-
                 tion preference.

                 A status of Active confirms that the preference is applied in
                 the latest recommendation refresh, and a status  of  Inactive
                 confirms that it's not yet applied to recommendations.

                 For  more information, see Enhanced infrastructure metrics in
                 the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

              inferredWorkloadTypes -> (string)

                 firms that it's not yet applied to recommendations.
