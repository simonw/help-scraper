NAME
       export-ebs-volume-recommendations -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports optimization recommendations for Amazon EBS volumes.

       Recommendations  are  exported in a comma-separated values (.csv) file,
       and its metadata in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  (.json)  file,
       to  an  existing  Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that
       you specify. For more information, see Exporting Recommendations in the
       Compute Optimizer User Guide .

       You can have only one Amazon EBS volume export job in progress per Ama-
       zon Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          The IDs of the Amazon Web Services accounts for which to export Ama-
          zon EBS volume recommendations.

          If  your  account  is the management account of an organization, use
          this parameter to specify the member account for which you  want  to
          export recommendations.

          This  parameter cannot be specified together with the include member
          accounts parameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if  this  parameter,  or  the  include member accounts parameter, is
          omitted.

          You can specify multiple account IDs per request.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that exports a more specific
          set of Amazon EBS volume recommendations.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter that returns a more specific list of Amazon
              Elastic Block Store (Amazon  EBS)  volume  recommendations.  Use
              this filter with the  GetEBSVolumeRecommendations action.

              You  can  use  LambdaFunctionRecommendationFilter with the  Get-
              LambdaFunctionRecommendations action, JobFilter  with  the   De-
              scribeRecommendationExportJobs   action,  and  Filter  with  the
              GetAutoScalingGroupRecommendations and   GetEC2InstanceRecommen-
              dations actions.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Finding  to  return  recommendations with a specific
                 finding classification (for example, NotOptimized ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Optimized , or NotOptimized .

          ]

       --fields-to-export (list)
          The recommendations data to include in the export file. For more in-
          formation  about the fields that can be exported, see Exported files

       --s3-destination-config (structure)
          Describes the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
          bucket name and key prefix for a recommendations export job.

          You  must create the destination Amazon S3 bucket for your recommen-
          dations export before you create the export job.  Compute  Optimizer
          does  not  create  the  S3  bucket  for you. After you create the S3
          bucket, ensure that it has the required permission policy  to  allow
          Compute  Optimizer  to  write  the export file to it. If you plan to
          specify an object prefix when you create the export  job,  you  must
          include  the  object  prefix  in  the  policy that you add to the S3
          bucket. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Policy  for  Com-
          pute Optimizer in the Compute Optimizer User Guide .

          bucket -> (string)
              The  name  of the Amazon S3 bucket to use as the destination for
              an export job.

          keyPrefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix for an export job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          bucket=string,keyPrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "bucket": "string",
            "keyPrefix": "string"
          }

       --file-format (string)
          The format of the export file.

          The only export file format currently supported is Csv .

          Possible values:

          o Csv

       --include-member-accounts | --no-include-member-accounts (boolean)
          Indicates whether to include recommendations for  resources  in  all
          member  accounts  of the organization if your account is the manage-
          ment account of an organization.

          The member accounts must also be opted in to Compute Optimizer,  and
          trusted  access for Compute Optimizer must be enabled in the organi-
          zation account. For more information, see Compute Optimizer and Ama-
          zon  Web  Services Organizations trusted access in the Compute Opti-
          mizer User Guide .

          Recommendations for member accounts of the organization are not  in-
          cluded in the export file if this parameter is omitted.

          This parameter cannot be specified together with the account IDs pa-
          rameter. The parameters are mutually exclusive.

          Recommendations for member accounts are not included in  the  export
          if this parameter, or the account IDs parameter, is omitted.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobId -> (string)
          The identification number of the export job.

          Use  the   DescribeRecommendationExportJobs  action, and specify the
          job ID to view the status of an export job.

       s3Destination -> (structure)
          Describes the destination Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
          bucket  name  and  object keys of a recommendations export file, and
          its associated metadata file.

          bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket used as the destination  of  an
              export file.

          key -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of an export file.

              The  key  uniquely identifies the object, or export file, in the
              S3 bucket.

          metadataKey -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket key of a metadata file.

              The key uniquely identifies the object, or metadata file, in the
              S3 bucket.
