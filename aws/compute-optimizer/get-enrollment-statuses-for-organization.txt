GET-ENROLLMENT-STATUSES-FOR-ORGANIZAGET-ENROLLMENT-STATUSES-FOR-ORGANIZATION()



NAME
       get-enrollment-statuses-for-organization -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  Compute Optimizer enrollment (opt-in) status of organiza-
       tion member accounts, if your account is an organization management ac-
       count.

       To  get  the  enrollment status of standalone accounts, use the  GetEn-
       rollmentStatus action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       get-enrollment-statuses-for-organization is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: accountEnrollmentStatuses

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of account enrollment statuses.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter that returns a more specific list of  account
              enrollment statuses. Use this filter with the  GetEnrollmentSta-
              tusesForOrganization action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify Status to return accounts with a specific  enrollment
                 status (for example, Active ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Active , Inactive , Pending , and Failed
                 .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Status",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       o on

       o off

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       accountEnrollmentStatuses -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the enrollment statuses of organi-
          zation member accounts.

          (structure)
              Describes  the enrollment status of an organization's member ac-
              counts in Compute Optimizer.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

              status -> (string)
                 The account enrollment status.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the account enrollment status.

                 For example, an account might show a status  of  Pending  be-
                 cause member accounts of an organization require more time to
                 be enrolled in the service.

              lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, of when the account en-
                 rollment status was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to use to advance to the next page of account enrollment
          statuses.

          This value is null when there are no more pages of  account  enroll-
          ment statuses to return.
