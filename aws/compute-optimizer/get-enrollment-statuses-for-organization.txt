SYNOPSIS
            get-enrollment-statuses-for-organization
          [--filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of objects to specify a filter that returns a more specific
          list of account enrollment statuses.

          (structure)
              Describes  a filter that returns a more specific list of account
              enrollment statuses. Use this filter with the  GetEnrollmentSta-
              tusesForOrganization action.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 Specify  Status to return accounts with a specific enrollment
                 status (for example, Active ).

              values -> (list)
                 The value of the filter.

                 The valid values are Active , Inactive , Pending , and Failed
                 .

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "Status",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  to  advance  to the next page of account enrollment sta-
          tuses.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of account enrollment statuses to return  with  a
          single  request.  You  can specify up to 100 statuses to return with
          each request.

          To retrieve the remaining results, make another request with the re-
          turned nextToken value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       accountEnrollmentStatuses -> (list)
          An array of objects that describe the enrollment statuses of organi-
          zation member accounts.

          (structure)
              Describes  the enrollment status of an organization's member ac-
              counts in Compute Optimizer.

              accountId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services account ID.

              status -> (string)
                 The account enrollment status.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the account enrollment status.

                 For example, an account might show a status  of  Pending  be-
                 cause member accounts of an organization require more time to
                 be enrolled in the service.

              lastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The Unix epoch timestamp, in seconds, of when the account en-
                 rollment status was last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to use to advance to the next page of account enrollment
          statuses.

          This value is null when there are no more pages of  account  enroll-
          ment statuses to return.
