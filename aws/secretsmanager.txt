          Logging API Requests

       Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services Cloud-
       Trail,  a  service  that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your
       Amazon Web Services account and delivers log  files  to  an  Amazon  S3
       bucket.  By  using  information that's collected by Amazon Web Services
       CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets
       Manager,  who  made  the request, when it was made, and so on. For more
