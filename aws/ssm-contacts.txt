DESCRIPTION
       Systems  Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console de-
       signed to help users mitigate  and  recover  from  incidents  affecting
       their  Amazon  Web Services-hosted applications. An incident is any un-
       planned interruption or reduction in quality of services.

       Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying  responders
       of  impact,  highlighting  relevant troubleshooting data, and providing
       collaboration tools to get services back up and running. To achieve the
       primary  goal of reducing the time-to-resolution of critical incidents,
       Incident Manager automates response plans and  enables  responder  team
       escalation.
