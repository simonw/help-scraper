DESCRIBE-LIMITS()                                            DESCRIBE-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  current  provisioned-capacity  quotas for your Amazon Web
       Services account in a Region, both for the Region as a  whole  and  for
       any one DynamoDB table that you create there.

       When you establish an Amazon Web Services account, the account has ini-
       tial quotas on the maximum read capacity units and write capacity units
       that  you  can  provision across all of your DynamoDB tables in a given
       Region. Also, there are per-table quotas that apply when you  create  a
       table there. For more information, see Service, Account, and Table Quo-
       tas page in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       Although you can increase these quotas by filing a case at  Amazon  Web
       Services  Support Center , obtaining the increase is not instantaneous.
       The DescribeLimits action lets you write code to compare  the  capacity
       you are currently using to those quotas imposed by your account so that
       you have enough time to apply for an increase before you hit a quota.

       For example, you could use one of the Amazon Web Services  SDKs  to  do
       the following:

       o Call  DescribeLimits  for  a particular Region to obtain your current
         account quotas on provisioned capacity there.

       o Create a variable to hold the aggregate read  capacity  units  provi-
         sioned for all your tables in that Region, and one to hold the aggre-
         gate write capacity units. Zero them both.

       o Call ListTables to obtain a list of all your DynamoDB tables.

       o For each table name listed by ListTables , do the following:

         o Call DescribeTable with the table name.

         o Use the data returned by DescribeTable to  add  the  read  capacity
           units  and write capacity units provisioned for the table itself to
           your variables.

         o If the table has one or more global secondary indexes (GSIs),  loop
           over  these  GSIs and add their provisioned capacity values to your
           variables as well.

       o Report the account quotas for that Region returned by  DescribeLimits
         ,  along  with the total current provisioned capacity levels you have
         calculated.

       This will let you see  whether  you  are  getting  close  to  your  ac-
       count-level quotas.

       The per-table quotas apply only when you are creating a new table. They
       restrict the sum of the provisioned capacity of the  new  table  itself
       and all its global secondary indexes.

       For  existing  tables and their GSIs, DynamoDB doesn't let you increase
       provisioned capacity extremely rapidly, but the only quota that applies
       is  that  the  aggregate  provisioned capacity over all your tables and
       GSIs cannot exceed either of the per-account quotas.

       NOTE:
          DescribeLimits should only be called periodically.  You  can  expect
          throttling errors if you call it more than once in a minute.

       The DescribeLimits Request element has no content.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-limits
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]
          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
