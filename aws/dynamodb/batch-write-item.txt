BATCH-WRITE-ITEM()                                          BATCH-WRITE-ITEM()



NAME
       batch-write-item -

DESCRIPTION
       The  BatchWriteItem  operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or
       more tables. A single call to BatchWriteItem can transmit up to 16MB of
       data over the network, consisting of up to 25 item put or delete opera-
       tions. While individual items can be up to 400 KB once stored, it's im-
       portant  to  note  that  an item's representation might be greater than
       400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call.  For
       more details on this distinction, see Naming Rules and Data Types .

       NOTE:
          BatchWriteItem  cannot  update  items.  To update items, use the Up-
          dateItem action.

       The individual PutItem and DeleteItem operations  specified  in  Batch-
       WriteItem  are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as a whole is not. If any
       requested operations fail because the table's provisioned throughput is
       exceeded  or  an  internal processing failure occurs, the failed opera-
       tions are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You  can
       investigate  and  optionally  resend the requests. Typically, you would
       call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each iteration would  check  for  unpro-
       cessed  items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with those unpro-
       cessed items until all items have been processed.

       If none of the items can be processed due to  insufficient  provisioned
       throughput on all of the tables in the request, then BatchWriteItem re-
       turns a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException .

       WARNING:
          If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed  items,  you  should  retry  the
          batch  operation on those items. However, we strongly recommend that
          you use an exponential backoff algorithm . If you  retry  the  batch
          operation  immediately,  the  underlying  read or write requests can
          still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you  delay
          the  batch  operation  using exponential backoff, the individual re-
          quests in the batch are much more likely to succeed.

          For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in the
          Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       With BatchWriteItem , you can efficiently write or delete large amounts
       of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data  from  another  database
       into  DynamoDB.  In order to improve performance with these large-scale
       operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as  individ-
       ual PutItem and DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify
       conditions on individual put and delete  requests,  and  BatchWriteItem
       does not return deleted items in the response.

       If  you  use  a programming language that supports concurrency, you can
       use threads to write items in parallel. Your application  must  include
       the  necessary  logic  to manage the threads. With languages that don't
       support threading, you must update or delete the specified items one at
       a  time.  In both situations, BatchWriteItem performs the specified put
       and delete operations in parallel, giving you the power of  the  thread
       pool approach without having to introduce complexity into your applica-
       tion.

       Parallel processing reduces latency, but each specified put and  delete
       request  consumes the same number of write capacity units whether it is
       processed in parallel or not. Delete operations  on  nonexistent  items
       consume one write capacity unit.

       If  one  or  more of the following is true, DynamoDB rejects the entire
       batch write operation:

       o One or more tables specified in the BatchWriteItem request  does  not
         exist.

       o Primary  key  attributes  specified  on an item in the request do not
         match those in the corresponding table's primary key schema.

       o You try to perform multiple operations on the same item in  the  same
         BatchWriteItem  request.  For  example, you cannot put and delete the
         same item in the same BatchWriteItem request.

       o Your request contains at least two  items  with  identical  hash  and
         range keys (which essentially is two put operations).

       o There are more than 25 requests in the batch.

       o Any individual item in a batch exceeds 400 KB.

       o The total request size exceeds 16 MB.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-write-item
          --request-items <value>
          [--return-consumed-capacity <value>]
          [--return-item-collection-metrics <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --request-items (map)
          A  map of one or more table names and, for each table, a list of op-
          erations to be performed (DeleteRequest or PutRequest ).  Each  ele-
          ment in the map consists of the following:

          o DeleteRequest  -  Perform  a DeleteItem operation on the specified
            item. The item to be deleted is identified by a Key subelement:

            o Key - A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely  iden-
              tify  the  item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute
              name and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must pro-
              vide  all of the key attributes. For example, with a simple pri-
              mary key, you only need to provide a  value  for  the  partition
              key.  For  a  composite primary key, you must provide values for
              both the partition key and the sort key.

          o PutRequest - Perform a PutItem operation on  the  specified  item.
            The item to be put is identified by an Item subelement:

            o Item  - A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in this
              map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attri-
              bute  values must not be null; string and binary type attributes
              must have lengths greater than zero;  and  set  type  attributes
              must  not  be  empty. Requests that contain empty values are re-
              jected with a ValidationException exception. If you specify  any
              attributes  that  are  part of an index key, then the data types
              for those attributes must match those of the schema in  the  ta-
              ble's attribute definition.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Represents  an  operation  to  perform - either DeleteItem or
                 PutItem . You can only request one of these  operations,  not
                 both,  in  a  single WriteRequest . If you do need to perform
                 both of these operations, you need to  provide  two  separate
                 WriteRequest objects.

                 PutRequest -> (structure)
                     A request to perform a PutItem operation.

                     Item -> (map)
                        A  map  of  attribute name to attribute values, repre-
                        senting the primary key of an item to be processed  by
                        PutItem  .  All  of the table's primary key attributes
                        must be specified, and their  data  types  must  match
                        those of the table's key schema. If any attributes are
                        present in the item that are  part  of  an  index  key
                        schema for the table, their types must match the index
                        key schema.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

                            DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                            S -> (string)
                               An attribute of type String. For example:
                                   "S": "Hello"

                            N -> (string)
                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                                   "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                            SS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                                   "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                               (string)

                            NS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                                   "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB

                            BS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                                   "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                               (blob)

                            M -> (map)
                               An attribute of type Map. For example:
                                   "M":  {"Name":  {"S":  "Joe"}, "Age": {"N":
                                   "35"}}

                               value -> (structure)
                                   Represents the data for an attribute.

                                   Each attribute  value  is  described  as  a
                                   name-value pair. The name is the data type,
                                   and the value is the data itself.

                                   Represents the data for an attribute.

                                   Each attribute  value  is  described  as  a
                                   name-value pair. The name is the data type,
                                   and the value is the data itself.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the operation, together with ConsumedCapacity for each  table  and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these  cases, specifying INDEXES will only return ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate  ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --return-item-collection-metrics (string)
          Determines  whether  item collection metrics are returned. If set to
          SIZE , the response includes statistics about item  collections,  if
          any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the re-
          sponse. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SIZE

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following batch-write-item example adds three new items to the Mus-
       icCollection table using a batch of three PutItem requests. It also re-
       quests information about the number of write capacity units consumed by
       the operation and any item collections modified by the operation.

OUTPUT
       UnprocessedItems -> (map)
          A map of tables and requests against those tables that were not pro-
          cessed. The UnprocessedItems value  is  in  the  same  form  as  Re-
          questItems  , so you can provide this value directly to a subsequent
          BatchGetItem operation. For more information,  see  RequestItems  in
          the Request Parameters section.

          Each  UnprocessedItems  entry consists of a table name and, for that
          table, a list of operations to perform (DeleteRequest or  PutRequest
          ).

          o DeleteRequest  -  Perform  a DeleteItem operation on the specified
            item. The item to be deleted is identified by a Key subelement:

            o Key - A map of primary key attribute values that uniquely  iden-
              tify  the  item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute
              name and an attribute value.

          o PutRequest - Perform a PutItem operation on  the  specified  item.
            The item to be put is identified by an Item subelement:

            o Item  - A map of attributes and their values. Each entry in this
              map consists of an attribute name and an attribute value. Attri-
              bute  values must not be null; string and binary type attributes
              must have lengths greater than zero;  and  set  type  attributes
              must  not  be  empty. Requests that contain empty values will be
              rejected with a ValidationException exception.  If  you  specify
              any  attributes  that  are  part  of an index key, then the data
              types for those attributes must match those of the schema in the
              table's attribute definition.

          If  there  are no unprocessed items remaining, the response contains
          an empty UnprocessedItems map.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Represents an operation to perform  -  either  DeleteItem  or
                 PutItem  .  You can only request one of these operations, not
                 both, in a single WriteRequest . If you do  need  to  perform
                 both  of  these  operations, you need to provide two separate
                 WriteRequest objects.

                 PutRequest -> (structure)
                     A request to perform a PutItem operation.

                     Item -> (map)
                        A map of attribute name to  attribute  values,  repre-
                        senting  the primary key of an item to be processed by
                        PutItem . All of the table's  primary  key  attributes
                        must  be  specified,  and  their data types must match
                        those of the table's key schema. If any attributes are
                        present  in  the  item  that  are part of an index key
                        schema for the table, their types must match the index
                        key schema.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is
                            the data itself.

                               An attribute of type String. For example:
                                   "S": "Hello"

                            N -> (string)
                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as  strings,  to  maximize compatibility across
                               languages  and  libraries.  However,   DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                               (string)

                            NS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                                   "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

       ItemCollectionMetrics -> (map)
          A list of tables that were processed by BatchWriteItem and, for each
          table, information about any item collections that were affected  by
          individual DeleteItem or PutItem operations.

          Each entry consists of the following subelements:

          o ItemCollectionKey  -  The  partition key value of the item collec-
            tion. This is the same as the partition key value of the item.

          o SizeEstimateRangeGB - An estimate of  item  collection  size,  ex-
            pressed  in  GB.  This  is  a two-element array containing a lower
            bound and an upper bound for the estimate. The  estimate  includes
            the  size  of all the items in the table, plus the size of all at-
            tributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on  the
            table.  Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary in-
            dex is approaching its size limit.  The  estimate  is  subject  to
            change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accu-
            racy of the estimate.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Information about item collections, if  any,  that  were  af-
                 fected  by  the  operation. ItemCollectionMetrics is only re-
                 turned if the request asked for it. If  the  table  does  not
                 have any local secondary indexes, this information is not re-
                 turned in the response.

                 ItemCollectionKey -> (map)
                     The partition key value  of  the  item  collection.  This
                     value is the same as the partition key value of the item.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                 SizeEstimateRangeGB -> (list)
                     An  estimate  of item collection size, in gigabytes. This
                     value is a two-element array containing a lower bound and
                     an  upper  bound  for the estimate. The estimate includes
                     the size of all the items in the table, plus the size  of
                     all  attributes projected into all of the local secondary
                     indexes on that  table.  Use  this  estimate  to  measure
                     whether  a  local secondary index is approaching its size
                     limit.

                     The estimate is subject to change over  time;  therefore,
                     do not rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
