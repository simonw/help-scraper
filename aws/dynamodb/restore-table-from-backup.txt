NAME
       restore-table-from-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  table from an existing backup. Any number of users can
       execute up to 50 concurrent restores (any type of restore) in  a  given
       account.

       You  can  call RestoreTableFromBackup at a maximum rate of 10 times per
       second.

       You must manually set up the following on the restored table:

       o Auto scaling policies

       o IAM policies

       o Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms

       o Tags

       o Stream settings

       o Time to Live (TTL) settings

OPTIONS
       --target-table-name (string)
          The name of the new table to which the backup must be restored.

       --backup-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the backup.

       --billing-mode-override (string)
          The billing mode of the restored table.

          Possible values:

          o PROVISIONED

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST

       --global-secondary-index-override (list)
          List of global secondary indexes for the restored table. The indexes
          provided  should match existing secondary indexes. You can choose to
          exclude some or all of the indexes at the time of restore.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the global secondary  index.  The  name  must  be
                 unique among all other indexes on this table.

              KeySchema -> (list)
                 The  complete  key schema for a global secondary index, which
                 consists of one or more pairs  of  attribute  names  and  key
                 types:

                 o HASH - partition key

                 o RANGE - sort key

                 NOTE:
                     The  partition  key  of an item is also known as its hash
                     attribute . The term "hash attribute"  derives  from  Dy-
                     namoDB's  usage  of  an  internal hash function to evenly
                     distribute data items across partitions, based  on  their
                     partition key values.

                     The sort key of an item is also known as its range attri-
                     bute . The term "range attribute" derives  from  the  way
                     DynamoDB  stores items with the same partition key physi-
                     cally close together, in sorted order  by  the  sort  key
                     value.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema
                     specifies the attributes that make up the primary key  of
                     a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                     A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of
                     the primary key. For example, a simple primary key  would
                     be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition
                     key).  A  composite  primary  key   would   require   one
                     KeySchemaElement  for  the  partition  key,  and  another
                     KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                     A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attribute
                     (not  a  nested  attribute). The data type must be one of
                     String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested
                     within a List or a Map.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of a key attribute.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The role that this key attribute will assume:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The  partition key of an item is also known as its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"  derives
                            from  the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

              Projection -> (structure)
                 Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from the
                 table into the global secondary index. These are in  addition
                 to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which
                 are automatically projected.

                 ProjectionType -> (string)
                     The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                     o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary  keys  are  pro-
                       jected into the index.

                     o INCLUDE  -  In  addition to the attributes described in
                       KEYS_ONLY , the  secondary  index  will  include  other
                       non-key attributes that you specify.

                     o ALL  -  All  of the table attributes are projected into
                       the index.

                     When using the DynamoDB console, ALL is selected  by  de-
                     fault.

                 NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                     Represents the non-key attribute names which will be pro-
                     jected into the index.

                     For local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAt-
                     tributes  summed  across  all  of the local secondary in-
                     dexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same  at-
                     tribute  into  two  different indexes, this counts as two
                     distinct attributes when determining the total.

                     (string)

              ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                 Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the speci-
                 fied global secondary index.

                 For  current  minimum and maximum provisioned throughput val-
                 ues, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon Dy-
                 namoDB Developer Guide .

                 ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The  maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed
                     per second before DynamoDB returns a  ThrottlingException
                     . For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Re-
                     quirements in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the  value
                     is set to 0.

                 WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second before
                     DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . For more  infor-
                     mation, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the  value
                     is set to 0.

              OnDemandThroughput -> (structure)
                 The  maximum number of read and write units for the specified
                 global secondary index. If you use this parameter,  you  must
                 specify MaxReadRequestUnits , MaxWriteRequestUnits , or both.

                 MaxReadRequestUnits -> (long)
                     Maximum  number  of  read request units for the specified
                     table.

                     To specify a maximum OnDemandThroughput  on  your  table,
                     set  the  value of MaxReadRequestUnits as greater than or
                     equal to 1. To remove the maximum OnDemandThroughput that
                     is currently set on your table, set the value of MaxRead-
                     RequestUnits to -1.

                 MaxWriteRequestUnits -> (long)
                     Maximum number of write request units for  the  specified
                     table.

                     To  specify  a  maximum OnDemandThroughput on your table,
                     set the value of MaxWriteRequestUnits as greater than  or
                     equal to 1. To remove the maximum OnDemandThroughput that
                     is  currently  set  on  your  table,  set  the  value  of
                     MaxWriteRequestUnits to -1.

              WarmThroughput -> (structure)
                 Represents  the warm throughput value (in read units per sec-
                 ond and write units per second) for the  specified  secondary
                 index.  If  you  use  this  parameter, you must specify Read-
                 UnitsPerSecond , WriteUnitsPerSecond , or both.

                 ReadUnitsPerSecond -> (long)
                     Represents the number of read operations your base  table
                     can instantaneously support.

                 WriteUnitsPerSecond -> (long)
                     Represents the number of write operations your base table
                     can instantaneously support.

       --local-secondary-index-override (list)
          List of local secondary indexes for the restored table. The  indexes
          provided  should match existing secondary indexes. You can choose to
          exclude some or all of the indexes at the time of restore.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the local  secondary  index.  The  name  must  be
                 unique among all other indexes on this table.

              KeySchema -> (list)
                 The  complete  key schema for the local secondary index, con-
                 sisting of one or more  pairs  of  attribute  names  and  key
                 types:

                 o HASH - partition key

                 o RANGE - sort key

                 NOTE:
                     The  partition  key  of an item is also known as its hash
                     attribute . The term "hash attribute"  derives  from  Dy-
                     namoDB's  usage  of  an  internal hash function to evenly
                     distribute data items across partitions, based  on  their

                     The sort key of an item is also known as its range attri-
                     bute . The term "range attribute" derives  from  the  way
                     DynamoDB  stores items with the same partition key physi-
                     cally close together, in sorted order  by  the  sort  key
                     value.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema
                     specifies the attributes that make up the primary key  of
                     a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                     A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of
                     the primary key. For example, a simple primary key  would
                     be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition
                     key).  A  composite  primary  key   would   require   one
                     KeySchemaElement  for  the  partition  key,  and  another
                     KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                     A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attribute
                     (not  a  nested  attribute). The data type must be one of
                     String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested
                     within a List or a Map.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of a key attribute.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The role that this key attribute will assume:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The  partition key of an item is also known as its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"  derives
                            from  the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same

                            order by the sort key value.

              Projection -> (structure)
                 Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from the
                 table into the local secondary index. These are  in  addition
                 to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which
                 are automatically projected.

                 ProjectionType -> (string)
                     The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                     o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary  keys  are  pro-
                       jected into the index.

                     o INCLUDE  -  In  addition to the attributes described in
                       KEYS_ONLY , the  secondary  index  will  include  other
                       non-key attributes that you specify.

                     o ALL  -  All  of the table attributes are projected into
                       the index.

                     When using the DynamoDB console, ALL is selected  by  de-
                     fault.

                 NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                     Represents the non-key attribute names which will be pro-
                     jected into the index.

                     For local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAt-
                     tributes  summed  across  all  of the local secondary in-
                     dexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same  at-
                     tribute  into  two  different indexes, this counts as two
                     distinct attributes when determining the total.

       --sse-specification-override (structure)
          The new server-side encryption settings for the restored table.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon
              Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If
              enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to KMS and an
              Amazon  Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply). If
              disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set
              to Amazon Web Services owned key.

          SSEType -> (string)
              Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

              o KMS - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service.
                The key is stored in your account and is managed by  KMS  (KMS
                charges apply).

          KMSMasterKeyId -> (string)
              The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To spec-
              ify a key, use its key ID, Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN),  alias
              name,  or  alias ARN. Note that you should only provide this pa-
              rameter if the key is different from the  default  DynamoDB  key
              alias/aws/dynamodb .

            "KMSMasterKeyId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

OUTPUT
       TableDescription -> (structure)
          The description of the table created from an existing backup.

          AttributeDefinitions -> (list)
              An array of AttributeDefinition objects. Each of  these  objects
              describes one attribute in the table and index key schema.

              Each AttributeDefinition object in this array is composed of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o AttributeType - The data type for the attribute.

              (structure)
                 Represents an attribute for describing the schema for the ta-
                 ble and indexes.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     A name for the attribute.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type for the attribute, where:

                     o S - the attribute is of type String

                     o N - the attribute is of type Number

                     o B - the attribute is of type Binary

          TableName -> (string)
              The name of the table.

          KeySchema -> (list)
              The primary key structure for the table.  Each  KeySchemaElement
              consists of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o KeyType - The role of the attribute:

                o HASH - partition key

                o RANGE - sort key

              NOTE:
                 The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attri-
                 bute . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's  us-
                 age  of  an  internal hash function to evenly distribute data
                 items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                 The sort key of an item is also known as its range  attribute
                 .  The  term  "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB
                 stores items with the same partition key physically close to-
                 gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              For  more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              (structure)
                 Represents a single element of a key  schema.  A  key  schema
                 specifies  the  attributes  that make up the primary key of a
                 table, or the key attributes of an index.

                 A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one  attribute  of  the
                 primary  key. For example, a simple primary key would be rep-
                 resented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition  key).  A
                 composite  primary key would require one KeySchemaElement for
                 the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the  sort
                 key.

                 A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not
                 a nested attribute). The data type must  be  one  of  String,
                 Number,  or  Binary.  The attribute cannot be nested within a
                 List or a Map.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of a key attribute.

                 KeyType -> (string)
                     The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

          TableStatus -> (string)
              The current state of the table:

              o CREATING - The table is being created.

              o UPDATING - The table/index configuration is being updated. The
                table/index  remains available for data operations when UPDAT-
                ING .

              o DELETING - The table is being deleted.

              o ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

              o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key used to  en-
                crypt the table in inaccessible. Table operations may fail due
                to failure to use the KMS key. DynamoDB will initiate the  ta-
                ble archival process when a table's KMS key remains inaccessi-
                ble for more than seven days.

              o ARCHIVING - The table is being archived.  Operations  are  not
                allowed until archival is complete.

              o ARCHIVED - The table has been archived. See the ArchivalReason
                for more information.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the table was created, in UNIX epoch time
              format.

          ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
              The provisioned throughput settings for the table, consisting of
              read and write capacity units, along with data  about  increases
              and decreases.

              LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase
                 for this table.

              LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease
                 for this table.

              NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                 The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table
                 during this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on  provi-
                 sioned  throughput decreases, see Service, Account, and Table
                 Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed  per
                 second  before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . Even-
                 tually consistent reads require  less  effort  than  strongly
                 consistent  reads,  so  a setting of 50 ReadCapacityUnits per
                 second provides 100 eventually  consistent  ReadCapacityUnits
                 per second.

              WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second before Dy-
                 namoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

          TableSizeBytes -> (long)
              The total size of the specified table, in  bytes.  DynamoDB  up-
              dates  this  value approximately every six hours. Recent changes
              might not be reflected in this value.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The number of items in the  specified  table.  DynamoDB  updates
              this  value  approximately every six hours. Recent changes might
              not be reflected in this value.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the  ta-
              ble.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique  identifier  for  the table for which the backup was cre-
              ated.

          BillingModeSummary -> (structure)
              Contains the details for the read/write capacity mode.

              BillingMode -> (string)
                 Controls how you are charged for read  and  write  throughput
                 and  how  you  manage  capacity.  This setting can be changed
                 later.

                 o PROVISIONED - Sets the read/write capacity mode  to  PROVI-
                   SIONED  .  We  recommend  using PROVISIONED for predictable
                   workloads.

                 o PAY_PER_REQUEST - Sets  the  read/write  capacity  mode  to
                   PAY_PER_REQUEST  .  We  recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for
                   unpredictable workloads.

              LastUpdateToPayPerRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Represents the time when PAY_PER_REQUEST was last set as  the
                 read/write capacity mode.

          LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              Represents  one  or  more  local secondary indexes on the table.
              Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. Tables with
              one  or more local secondary indexes are subject to an item col-
              lection size limit, where the amount of data within a given item
              collection cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:

              o IndexName - The name of the local secondary index.

              o KeySchema  -  Specifies the complete index key schema. The at-
                tribute names in the key schema must  be  between  1  and  255
                characters  (inclusive).  The  key  schema must begin with the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied  (projected)
                from  the  table  into the index. These are in addition to the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically  projected.  Each  attribute specification is com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are  projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE  -  Only  the  specified table attributes are pro-
                    jected into the index. The list of projected attributes is
                    in NonKeyAttributes .

                  o ALL  -  All of the table attributes are projected into the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more  non-key  attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count of attributes provided in  NonKeyAttributes  ,  summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you project the same attribute into two  different  indexes,
                  this  counts as two distinct attributes when determining the
                  total.

              o IndexSizeBytes - Represents the total size of  the  index,  in
                bytes.  DynamoDB  updates  this  value approximately every six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o ItemCount - Represents the number of items in the  index.  Dy-
                namoDB  updates  this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              If the table is in the DELETING state, no information about  in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     Represents the name of the local secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The  complete  key  schema for the local secondary index,
                     consisting of one or more pairs of  attribute  names  and
                     key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's  usage of an internal hash function to evenly
                        distribute data  items  across  partitions,  based  on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute . The term "range attribute" derives from  the
                        way  DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key
                        schema specifies the attributes that make up the  pri-
                        mary  key  of a table, or the key attributes of an in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the  primary  key.  For  example, a simple primary key
                        would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for  the
                        partition  key). A composite primary key would require
                        one KeySchemaElement for the partition  key,  and  an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A  KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attri-
                        bute (not a nested attribute). The data type  must  be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The partition key of an item is also  known  as
                               its  hash attribute . The term "hash attribute"
                               derives from DynamoDB's usage  of  an  internal
                               hash  function  to evenly distribute data items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The  sort  key  of an item is also known as its
                               range attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the same partition  key  physically  close  to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from
                     the table into the global secondary index. These  are  in
                     addition  to the primary key attributes and index key at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The set of attributes that are projected into the  in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY  ,  the secondary index will include other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                        When  using  the  DynamoDB console, ALL is selected by
                        default.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents the non-key attribute names which  will  be
                        projected into the index.

                        For  local  secondary indexes, the total count of Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes,  must not exceed 100. If you project the same
                        attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The  number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB up-
                     dates this value approximately every  six  hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies
                     the index.

          GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table.  Each  index
              is  scoped  to a given partition key value. Each element is com-
              posed of:

              o Backfilling - If true, then the  index  is  currently  in  the
                backfilling  phase.  Backfilling occurs only when a new global
                secondary index is added to the table. It is  the  process  by
                which  DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the ta-
                ble. (This attribute does not appear  for  indexes  that  were
                created  during  a  CreateTable operation.)  You can delete an
                index that is being created during the Backfilling phase  when
                IndexStatus  is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is true. You
                can't delete the index that is being created when  IndexStatus
                is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is false. (This attribute
                does not appear for indexes that were created  during  a  Cre-
                ateTable operation.)

              o IndexName - The name of the global secondary index.

              o IndexSizeBytes - The total size of the global secondary index,
                in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every  six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o IndexStatus  -  The current status of the global secondary in-
                dex:

                o CREATING - The index is being created.

                o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

              o ItemCount - The number of items in the global secondary index.
                DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema.  The  at-
                tribute  names  in  the  key  schema must be between 1 and 255
                characters (inclusive). The key schema  must  begin  with  the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection  - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
                from the table into the index. These are in  addition  to  the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically projected. Each attribute  specification  is  com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE - In  addition  to  the  attributes  described  in
                    KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will include other non-key
                    attributes that you specify.

                  o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected  into  the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes  -  A list of one or more non-key attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count  of  attributes  provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you  project  the same attribute into two different indexes,
                  this counts as two distinct attributes when determining  the
                  total.

              o ProvisionedThroughput  -  The  provisioned throughput settings
                for the global secondary index, consisting of read  and  write
                capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.

              If  the table is in the DELETING state, no information about in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The complete key schema for  a  global  secondary  index,
                     which  consists  of  one or more pairs of attribute names
                     and key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a single element of a  key  schema.  A  key
                        schema  specifies the attributes that make up the pri-
                        mary key of a table, or the key attributes of  an  in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the primary key. For example,  a  simple  primary  key
                        would  be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the
                        partition key). A composite primary key would  require
                        one  KeySchemaElement  for  the partition key, and an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attri-
                        bute  (not  a nested attribute). The data type must be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The  partition  key of an item is also known as
                               its hash attribute . The term "hash  attribute"
                               derives  from  DynamoDB's  usage of an internal
                               hash function to evenly distribute  data  items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The sort key of an item is also  known  as  its
                               range  attribute  .  The term "range attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the  same  partition  key  physically close to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents attributes that are  copied  (projected)  from
                     the  table  into the global secondary index. These are in
                     addition to the primary key attributes and index key  at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The  set of attributes that are projected into the in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will  include  other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                        When using the DynamoDB console, ALL  is  selected  by
                        default.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents  the  non-key attribute names which will be
                        projected into the index.

                        For local secondary indexes, the total count  of  Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same
                        attribute  into  two different indexes, this counts as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the global secondary index:

                     o CREATING - The index is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

                 Backfilling -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the  index  is  currently  backfilling.
                     Backfilling  is the process of reading items from the ta-
                     ble and determining whether they can be added to the  in-
                     dex.  (Not  all items will qualify: For example, a parti-
                     tion key cannot have any duplicate values.)  If  an  item
                     can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all
                     items have been processed, the backfilling  operation  is
                     complete and Backfilling is false.

                     You  can delete an index that is being created during the
                     Backfilling phase when IndexStatus is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling  is  true. You can't delete the index that is
                     being created when IndexStatus is  set  to  CREATING  and
                     Backfilling is false.

                     NOTE:
                        For indexes that were created during a CreateTable op-
                        eration, the Backfilling attribute does not appear  in
                        the DescribeTable output.

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents  the  provisioned  throughput settings for the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For current minimum and  maximum  provisioned  throughput
                     values,  see  Service,  Account,  and Table Quotas in the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time of the last  provisioned  throughput
                        increase for this table.

                     LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time of the last provisioned throughput
                        decrease for this table.

                     NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                        The number of  provisioned  throughput  decreases  for
                        this  table  during this UTC calendar day. For current
                        maximums  on  provisioned  throughput  decreases,  see
                        Service,  Account,  and Table Quotas in the Amazon Dy-
                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The maximum number of strongly consistent  reads  con-
                        sumed  per  second  before  DynamoDB  returns a Throt-
                        tlingException . Eventually consistent  reads  require
                        less  effort than strongly consistent reads, so a set-
                        ting of 50 ReadCapacityUnits per second  provides  100
                        eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second be-
                        fore DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates  this value approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB  up-
                     dates  this  value  approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  uniquely  identifies
                     the index.

                 OnDemandThroughput -> (structure)
                     The maximum number of read and write units for the speci-
                     fied global secondary index. If you use  this  parameter,
                     you  must specify MaxReadRequestUnits , MaxWriteRequestU-
                     nits , or both.

                     MaxReadRequestUnits -> (long)
                        Maximum number of read request units for the specified
                        table.

                        To specify a maximum OnDemandThroughput on your table,
                        set the value of MaxReadRequestUnits as  greater  than
                        or  equal to 1. To remove the maximum OnDemandThrough-
                        put that is currently set on your table, set the value
                        of MaxReadRequestUnits to -1.

                     MaxWriteRequestUnits -> (long)
                        Maximum  number  of write request units for the speci-
                        fied table.

                        To specify a maximum OnDemandThroughput on your table,
                        set  the value of MaxWriteRequestUnits as greater than
                        or equal to 1. To remove the maximum  OnDemandThrough-
                        put that is currently set on your table, set the value
                        of MaxWriteRequestUnits to -1.

                 WarmThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents the warm throughput value (in read  units  per
                     second and write units per second) for the specified sec-
                     ondary index.

                     ReadUnitsPerSecond -> (long)
                        Represents warm throughput read units per second value
                        for a global secondary index.

                     WriteUnitsPerSecond -> (long)
                        Represents  warm  throughput  write  units  per second
                        value for a global secondary index.

                     Status -> (string)
                        Represents the warm throughput status being created or
                        updated  on  a  global secondary index. The status can
                        only be UPDATING or ACTIVE .

          StreamSpecification -> (structure)
              The current DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.

              StreamEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or  dis-
                 abled (false) on the table.

              StreamViewType -> (string)
                 When  an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType deter-
                 mines what information is written to the stream for this  ta-
                 ble. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

                 o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only  the key attributes of the modified item
                   are written to the stream.

                 o NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it  appears  after  it  was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o OLD_IMAGE  -  The entire item, as it appeared before it was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old  item  images
                   of the item are written to the stream.

          LatestStreamLabel -> (string)
              A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

              Note  that  LatestStreamLabel is not a unique identifier for the
              stream, because it is possible that a stream from another  table
              might  have  the same timestamp. However, the combination of the
              following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

              o Amazon Web Services customer ID

              o Table name

              o StreamLabel

          LatestStreamArn -> (string)

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED - The replica is  inaccessible  because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for more than 20  hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this
                        replica  from  the replication group. The replica will
                        not be deleted and replication will stop from  and  to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If the KMS key remains inaccessible for more  than  20
                        hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this  replica from the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 ReplicaStatusDescription -> (string)

                multi-Region eventual consistency.

              o STRONG : Indicates that the global  table  is  configured  for
                multi-Region strong consistency (preview).

              NOTE:
                 Multi-Region  strong  consistency  (MRSC)  is  a new DynamoDB
