LIST-BACKUPS()                                                  LIST-BACKUPS()



NAME
       list-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       List  backups  associated  with an Amazon Web Services account. To list
       backups for a given table, specify TableName .  ListBackups  returns  a
       paginated  list  of results with at most 1 MB worth of items in a page.
       You can also specify a maximum number of entries to be  returned  in  a
       page.

       In  the  request,  start  time is inclusive, but end time is exclusive.
       Note that these boundaries are for  the  time  at  which  the  original
       backup was requested.

       You can call ListBackups a maximum of five times per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-backups is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: BackupSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-backups
          [--table-name <value>]
          [--time-range-lower-bound <value>]
          [--time-range-upper-bound <value>]
          [--backup-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The backups from the table specified by TableName are listed.

       --time-range-lower-bound (timestamp)
          Only backups created after this time are listed. TimeRangeLowerBound
          is inclusive.

       --time-range-upper-bound (timestamp)
          Only  backups  created  before this time are listed. TimeRangeUpper-
          Bound is exclusive.

       --backup-type (string)
          The backups from the table specified by BackupType are listed.

          Where BackupType can be:

          o USER - On-demand backup created by you.

          o SYSTEM - On-demand backup automatically created by DynamoDB.

          o ALL - All types of on-demand backups (USER and SYSTEM).

          Possible values:

          o USER

          o SYSTEM

          o AWS_BACKUP

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all existing DynamoDB backups

       The following list-backups example lists all of your existing backups.

          aws dynamodb list-backups

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",

                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  },
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",

                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 400
                  }
              ]
          }

       For  more information, see On-Demand Backup and Restore for DynamoDB in
       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 2: To list user-created backups in a specific time range

       The following example lists only backups of the  MusicCollection  table
       that  were  created by the user (not those automatically created by Dy-
       namoDB) with a creation date between January 1, 2020 and March 1, 2020.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --time-range-lower-bound 1577836800 \
              --time-range-upper-bound 1583020800 \
              --backup-type USER

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 3: To limit page size

       The  following  example returns a list of all existing backups, but re-
       trieves only one item in each call, performing multiple calls if neces-
       sary to get the entire list. Limiting the page size is useful when run-
       ning list commands on a large number of resources, which can result  in
       a "timed out" error when using the default page size of 1000.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --page-size 1

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  },
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-b2abc345",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup2",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-06-26T11:08:35.431000-07:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 400
                  }
              ]
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 4: To limit the number of items returned

       The following example limits the number of items returned to 1. The re-
       sponse  includes a NextToken value with which to retrieve the next page
       of results.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --max-items 1

       Output:

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                      "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection",
                      "BackupArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/MusicCollection/backup/01234567890123-a1bcd234",
                      "BackupName": "MusicCollectionBackup1",
                      "BackupCreationDateTime": "2020-02-12T14:41:51.617000-08:00",
                      "BackupStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "BackupType": "USER",
                      "BackupSizeBytes": 170
                  }
              ],
              "NextToken": "abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9"
          }

       the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

       Example 5: To retrieve the next page of results

       The  following command uses the NextToken value from a previous call to
       the list-backups command to retrieve another page of results. Since the
       response  in this case does not include a NextToken value, we know that
       we have reached the end of the results.

          aws dynamodb list-backups \
              --starting-token abCDeFGhiJKlmnOPqrSTuvwxYZ1aBCdEFghijK7LM51nOpqRSTuv3WxY3ZabC5dEFGhI2Jk3LmnoPQ6RST9

       Output

          {
              "BackupSummaries": [
                  {
                      "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                      "TableId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

              BackupCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time at which the backup was created.

              BackupExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  at  which the automatic on-demand backup created by Dy-
                 namoDB will expire. This SYSTEM on-demand backup expires  au-
                 tomatically 35 days after its creation.

              BackupStatus -> (string)
                 Backup  can  be in one of the following states: CREATING, AC-
                 TIVE, DELETED.

              BackupType -> (string)
                 BackupType:

                 o USER - You create and  manage  these  using  the  on-demand
                   backup feature.

                 o SYSTEM  - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery
                   enabled, a SYSTEM backup is automatically  created  and  is
                   retained  for 35 days (at no additional cost). System back-
                   ups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state  it
                   was in just before the point of deletion.

                 o AWS_BACKUP  -  On-demand  backup created by you from Backup
                   service.

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 Size of the backup in bytes.

       LastEvaluatedBackupArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the backup last evaluated when the current  page  of  re-
          sults  was  returned, inclusive of the current page of results. This
          value may be specified as the ExclusiveStartBackupArn of a new List-
          Backups operation in order to fetch the next page of results.

          If  LastEvaluatedBackupArn  is  empty, then the last page of results
          has been processed and there are no more results to be retrieved.

          If LastEvaluatedBackupArn is not empty, this may or may not indicate
          that  there  is more data to be returned. All results are guaranteed
          to have been returned if and only if no value for LastEvaluatedBack-
          upArn is returned.



                                                                LIST-BACKUPS()
