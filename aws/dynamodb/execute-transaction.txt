EXECUTE-TRANSACTION()                                    EXECUTE-TRANSACTION()



NAME
       execute-transaction -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation  allows you to perform transactional reads or writes on
       data stored in DynamoDB, using PartiQL.

       NOTE:
          The entire transaction must consist of  either  read  statements  or
          write statements, you cannot mix both in one transaction. The EXISTS
          function is an exception and can be used to check the  condition  of
          specific  attributes  of  the  item  in  a  similar manner to Condi-
          tionCheck in the TransactWriteItems API.

OPTIONS
       --transact-statements (list)
          The list of PartiQL statements representing the transaction to run.

          (structure)
              Represents a PartiQL statement that uses parameters.

              Statement -> (string)
                 A PartiQL statement that uses parameters.

              Parameters -> (list)
                 The parameter values.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

                     namoDB Developer Guide .

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                            "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is
                            the data itself.

       --client-request-token (string)
          Set  this  value to get remaining results, if NextToken was returned
          in the statement response.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput  consumption  that  is returned in the response. For more
          information, see TransactGetItems and TransactWriteItems .

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

OUTPUT
       Responses -> (list)
          The response to a PartiQL transaction.

          (structure)
              Details for the requested item.

              Item -> (map)
                 Map  of attribute data consisting of the data type and attri-
                 bute value.

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

              tion. ConsumedCapacity is only returned if the request asked for
              it.  For  more information, see Provisioned capacity mode in the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                 in the input, you'll see the table ARN in the response.

                        The total number of read capacity units consumed on  a
                        table or an index.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (double)
                        The total number of write capacity units consumed on a
