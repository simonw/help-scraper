UPDATE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()                        UPDATE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()



NAME
       update-continuous-backups -

DESCRIPTION
          UpdateContinuousBackups  enables  or disables point in time recovery
          for the specified table. A successful  UpdateContinuousBackups  call
          returns  the current ContinuousBackupsDescription . Continuous back-
          ups are ENABLED on all tables at table creation. If  point  in  time
          recovery  is  enabled,  PointInTimeRecoveryStatus will be set to EN-
          ABLED.

       Once continuous backups and point in time recovery are enabled, you can
       restore to any point in time within EarliestRestorableDateTime and Lat-
       estRestorableDateTime .
          LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5 minutes before  the  current
          time.  You  can  restore  your table to any point in time during the
          last 35 days.

SYNOPSIS
            update-continuous-backups
          --table-name <value>
          --point-in-time-recovery-specification <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table.

       --point-in-time-recovery-specification (structure)
          Represents the settings used to enable point in time recovery.

          PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether point in time recovery is  enabled  (true)  or
              disabled (false) on the table.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update continuous backup settings for a DynamoDB table

       The  following  update-continuous-backups example enables point-in-time
       recovery for the MusicCollection table.

          aws dynamodb update-continuous-backups \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --point-in-time-recovery-specification PointInTimeRecoveryEnabled=true

       Output:

          {
              "ContinuousBackupsDescription": {
                  "ContinuousBackupsStatus": "ENABLED",
                  "PointInTimeRecoveryDescription": {
                      "PointInTimeRecoveryStatus": "ENABLED",
                      "EarliestRestorableDateTime": 1576622404.0,
                      "LatestRestorableDateTime": 1576622404.0
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       ContinuousBackupsDescription -> (structure)
          Represents  the  continuous  backups and point in time recovery set-
          tings on the table.

          ContinuousBackupsStatus -> (string)
              ContinuousBackupsStatus can be one of the following states:  EN-
              ABLED, DISABLED

          PointInTimeRecoveryDescription -> (structure)
              The  description  of the point in time recovery settings applied
              to the table.

              PointInTimeRecoveryStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of point in time recovery:

                 o ENABLED - Point in time recovery is enabled.

                 o DISABLED - Point in time recovery is disabled.

              EarliestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the earliest point in time you can restore your ta-
                 ble  to. You can restore your table to any point in time dur-
                 ing the last 35 days.

              LatestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5  minutes  before  the
                 current time.
