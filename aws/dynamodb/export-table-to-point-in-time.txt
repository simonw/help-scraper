EXPORT-TABLE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()                EXPORT-TABLE-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       export-table-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Exports  table  data to an S3 bucket. The table must have point in time
       recovery enabled, and you can export data  from  any  time  within  the
       point in time recovery window.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            export-table-to-point-in-time
          --table-arn <value>
          [--export-time <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --s3-bucket <value>
          [--s3-bucket-owner <value>]
          [--s3-prefix <value>]
          [--s3-sse-algorithm <value>]
          [--s3-sse-kms-key-id <value>]
          [--export-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the table to export.

       --export-time (timestamp)
          Time  in  the past from which to export table data. The table export
          will be a snapshot of the table's state at this point in time.

       --client-token (string)
          Providing a ClientToken  makes  the  call  to  ExportTableToPointIn-
          TimeInput idempotent, meaning that multiple identical calls have the
          same effect as one single call.

          A client token is valid for 8 hours after  the  first  request  that
          uses  it  is  completed.  After  8  hours, any request with the same
          client token is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit  the  same
          request with the same client token for more than 8 hours, or the re-
          sult might not be idempotent.

          If you submit a request with the same client token but a  change  in
          other  parameters within the 8-hour idempotency window, DynamoDB re-
          turns an IdempotentParameterMismatch exception.

       --s3-bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to export the snapshot to.

       --s3-bucket-owner (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that owns the  bucket  the
          export will be stored in.

       --s3-prefix (string)
          The  Amazon S3 bucket prefix to use as the file name and path of the
          exported snapshot.

       --s3-sse-algorithm (string)
          Type of encryption used on the bucket  where  export  data  will  be
          stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

          o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

          o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          Possible values:

          o AES256

          o KMS

       --s3-sse-kms-key-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the KMS managed key used to encrypt the S3 bucket where
          export data will be stored (if applicable).

       --export-format (string)
          The format for the exported data. Valid values for ExportFormat  are
          DYNAMODB_JSON or ION .

          Possible values:

          o DYNAMODB_JSON

          o ION

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ExportDescription -> (structure)
          Contains a description of the table export.

          ExportArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table export.

          ExportStatus -> (string)
              Export  can be in one of the following states: IN_PROGRESS, COM-
              PLETED, or FAILED.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task began.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the export task completed.

          ExportManifest -> (string)
              The name of the manifest file for the export task.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table that was exported.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique ID of the table that was exported.

          ExportTime -> (timestamp)
              Point in time from which table data was exported.

          ClientToken -> (string)
              The client token that was provided for the export task. A client
              token  makes  calls to ExportTableToPointInTimeInput idempotent,
              meaning that multiple identical calls have the  same  effect  as
              one single call.

              containing the export.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket prefix used as the file name  and  path  of
              the exported snapshot.

          S3SseAlgorithm -> (string)
              Type  of  encryption  used  on  the  bucket where export data is
              stored. Valid values for S3SseAlgorithm are:

              o AES256 - server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys

              o KMS - server-side encryption with KMS managed keys

          S3SseKmsKeyId -> (string)
              The ID of the KMS managed key used  to  encrypt  the  S3  bucket
              where export data is stored (if applicable).

          FailureCode -> (string)
              Status code for the result of the failed export.

              Export failure reason description.

          ExportFormat -> (string)
              The  format  of the exported data. Valid values for ExportFormat
