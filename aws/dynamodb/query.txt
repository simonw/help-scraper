QUERY()                                                                QUERY()



NAME
       query -

DESCRIPTION
       You  must  provide the name of the partition key attribute and a single
       value for that attribute. Query returns all items with  that  partition
       key  value.  Optionally, you can provide a sort key attribute and use a
       comparison operator to refine the search results.

       Use the KeyConditionExpression parameter to provide  a  specific  value
       for the partition key. The Query operation will return all of the items
       from the table or index with that partition key value. You can  option-
       ally  narrow  the scope of the Query operation by specifying a sort key
       value and a comparison operator in KeyConditionExpression . To  further
       refine the Query results, you can optionally provide a FilterExpression
       . A FilterExpression determines which items within the  results  should
       be returned to you. All of the other results are discarded.

       A Query operation always returns a result set. If no matching items are
       found, the result set will be empty. Queries that do not return results
       consume the minimum number of read capacity units for that type of read
       operation.

       NOTE:
              DynamoDB calculates the number of read capacity  units  consumed
              based  on  item size, not on the amount of data that is returned
              to an application. The number of capacity units consumed will be
              the  same whether you request all of the attributes (the default
              behavior) or just some of them (using a projection  expression).
              The  number  will also be the same whether or not you use a Fil-
              terExpression .

          Query results are always sorted by the sort key value. If  the  data
          type  of the sort key is Number, the results are returned in numeric
          order; otherwise, the results are returned in order of UTF-8  bytes.
          By  default,  the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, set
          the ScanIndexForward parameter to false.

       A single Query operation will read up to the maximum  number  of  items
       set  (if  using  the  Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and
       then apply any filtering to the results  using  FilterExpression  .  If
       LastEvaluatedKey  is present in the response, you will need to paginate
       the result set. For more information, see Paginating the Results in the
       Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .
          FilterExpression  is  applied after a Query finishes, but before the
          results are returned. A FilterExpression  cannot  contain  partition
          key  or sort key attributes. You need to specify those attributes in
          the KeyConditionExpression .

       NOTE:
          A Query operation can return an empty result set and a  LastEvaluat-
          edKey  if  all  the  items read for the page of results are filtered
          out.

       You can query a table, a local secondary index, or a  global  secondary
       index.  For  a  query on a table or on a local secondary index, you can
       set the ConsistentRead parameter to true and obtain a strongly  consis-
       tent  result.  Global  secondary  indexes support eventually consistent
       reads only, so do not specify ConsistentRead  when  querying  a  global
       secondary index.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       query is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in or-
       der to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagina-
       tion by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text
       and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query  argument
       must  extract data from the results of the following query expressions:
       Items, Count, ScannedCount

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table containing the requested items. You  can  also
          provide  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parame-
          ter.

       --index-name (string)
          The name of an index to query. This index can be any local secondary
          index  or  global secondary index on the table. Note that if you use
          the IndexName parameter, you must also provide TableName.

       --select (string)
          The attributes to be returned in the result. You  can  retrieve  all
          item  attributes,  specific  item  attributes, the count of matching
          items, or in the case of an index, some or  all  of  the  attributes
          projected into the index.

          o ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the spec-
            ified table or index. If you query a local secondary  index,  then
            for  each  matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches the entire
            item from the parent table. If the index is configured to  project
            all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the
            local secondary index, and no fetching is required.

          o ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES - Allowed only when  querying  an  index.
            Retrieves  all attributes that have been projected into the index.
            If the index is configured to project all attributes, this  return
            value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES .

          o COUNT  -  Returns  the  number  of matching items, rather than the
            matching items themselves. Note that this uses the  same  quantity
            of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the
            same item size calculations.

          o SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES - Returns only the attributes listed  in  Pro-
            jectionExpression  . This return value is equivalent to specifying
            ProjectionExpression without specifying any value for Select .  If
            you  query  or  scan  a local secondary index and request only at-
            tributes that are projected into that index,  the  operation  will
            read only the index and not the table. If any of the requested at-
            tributes are not projected into the  local  secondary  index,  Dy-
            namoDB  fetches  each  of  these attributes from the parent table.
            This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.
            If  you  query  or scan a global secondary index, you can only re-
            quest attributes that are projected into the  index.  Global  sec-
            ondary  index  queries cannot fetch attributes from the parent ta-
            ble.

          If neither Select nor ProjectionExpression are  specified,  DynamoDB
          defaults  to  ALL_ATTRIBUTES  when  accessing  a table, and ALL_PRO-
          JECTED_ATTRIBUTES when accessing an index. You cannot use  both  Se-
          lect  and  ProjectionExpression together in a single request, unless
          the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES . (This usage is equiva-
          lent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select
          .)

          NOTE:
              If you use the ProjectionExpression parameter,  then  the  value
              for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES . Any other value for
              Select will return an error.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_ATTRIBUTES

          o ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES

          o SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES

          o COUNT

       --attributes-to-get (list)
          This is a legacy parameter. Use  ProjectionExpression  instead.  For
          more  information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB Devel-
          oper Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --consistent-read | --no-consistent-read (boolean)
          Determines the read consistency model: If set to true , then the op-
          eration  uses  strongly  consistent  reads; otherwise, the operation
          uses eventually consistent reads.

          Strongly consistent reads are not supported on global secondary  in-
          dexes. If you query a global secondary index with ConsistentRead set
          to true , you will receive a ValidationException .

       --key-conditions (map)
          This is a legacy parameter. Use KeyConditionExpression instead.  For
          more information, see KeyConditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the selection criteria for a Query or Scan operation:

              o For a Query operation, Condition is used  for  specifying  the
                KeyConditions  to  use  when querying a table or an index. For
                KeyConditions , only the following  comparison  operators  are
                supported:   EQ  |  LE  | LT | GE | GT | BEGINS_WITH | BETWEEN
                Condition is also used in a QueryFilter , which evaluates  the
                query results and returns only the desired values.

              o For  a  Scan  operation,  Condition  is used in a ScanFilter ,
                which evaluates the scan results and returns only the  desired
                values.

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One  or  more  values to evaluate against the supplied attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String  value  comparisons  for greater than, equals, or less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is  greater  than A , and a is greater than B . For a list of
                 code                       values,                        see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary  data  as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                     For  more  information,  see Data Types in the Amazon Dy-
                     namoDB Developer Guide .

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                            "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

                            For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon

                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-

                            "3.14159"}]

                        (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

                            S -> (string)
                               An attribute of type String. For example:
                                   "S": "Hello"

                            N -> (string)
                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                                   "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                            SS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                                   "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                               (string)

                            NS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                                   "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                               (string)

                            BS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                                   "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                               (blob)

                            M -> (map)
                               An attribute of type Map. For example:
                                   "M":  {"Name":  {"S":  "Joe"}, "Age": {"N":
                                   "35"}}

                               key -> (string)

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            L -> (list)
                               An attribute of type List. For example:
                                   "L": [ {"S": "Cookies"} , {"S":  "Coffee"},
                                   {"N": "3.14159"}]

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            NULL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Null. For example:
                                   "NULL": true

                            BOOL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                                   "BOOL": true

                     NULL -> (boolean)
                        An attribute of type Null. For example:
                            "NULL": true

                     BOOL -> (boolean)
                        An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                            "BOOL": true

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A  comparator for evaluating attributes. For example, equals,
                 greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL |  CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ  :  Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including
                   lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can  contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue  element  of  type  String,  Number, Binary,
                   String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item  contains
                   an  AttributeValue element of a different type than the one
                   provided in the request, the value does not match. For  ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing  lists  and  maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue of type String, Number,  Binary,  String
                   Set,  Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue of a different type than the one  provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE  :  Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not a set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT  :  Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type).  If  an item contains an AttributeValue element of a
                   different type than the one provided in  the  request,  the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE  :  Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can con-
                   tain only one AttributeValue element of type  String,  Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} .  Also,  {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT  :  Greater  than.   AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or  Bi-
                   nary  (not  a  set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL  : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the existence  of  an  attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result  is
                     a  Boolean true . This result is because the attribute "a
                     " exists; its data type is not relevant to  the  NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL  : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NULL , the  result  is  a
                     Boolean  false  .  This is because the attribute "a " ex-
                     ists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL  compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS  :  Checks  for  a subsequence, or value in a set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the target attribute of the comparison is of  type  String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the input. If the target attribute of the comparison  is  a
                   set  ("SS  ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates
                   to true if it finds an exact match with any member  of  the
                   set.  CONTAINS  is  supported for lists: When evaluating "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS  : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or ab-
                   sence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If the  target  attribute  of  the
                   comparison  is  a  String, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a substring match. If the  target  attribute  of
                   the  comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put.  If  the  target  attribute of the comparison is a set
                   ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates  to
                   true  if it does not find an exact match with any member of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing  "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain  only  one  AttributeValue of type String or Binary
                   (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute  of  the
                   comparison  must  be of type String or Binary (not a Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList  can  contain one or more AttributeValue elements of
                   type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes  are  com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN  :  Greater  than  or equal to the first value, and
                   less than or equal to  the  second  value.    AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).  A
                   target  attribute  matches  if  the target value is greater
                   than, or equal to, the first  element  and  less  than,  or
                   equal  to,  the  second element. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  .  Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

          .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the selection criteria for a Query or Scan operation:

              o For  a  Query  operation, Condition is used for specifying the
                KeyConditions to use when querying a table or  an  index.  For
                KeyConditions  ,  only  the following comparison operators are
                supported:  EQ | LE | LT | GE | GT  |  BEGINS_WITH  |  BETWEEN
                Condition  is also used in a QueryFilter , which evaluates the
                query results and returns only the desired values.

              o For a Scan operation, Condition is  used  in  a  ScanFilter  ,
                which  evaluates the scan results and returns only the desired
                values.

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One or more values to evaluate against  the  supplied  attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String value comparisons for greater than,  equals,  or  less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is greater than A , and a is greater than B . For a  list  of
                 code                        values,                       see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For  Binary,  DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A comparator for evaluating attributes. For example,  equals,
                 greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ  | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data  types,  including
                   lists  and  maps.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue element  of  type  String,  Number,  Binary,
                   String  Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains
                   an AttributeValue element of a different type than the  one
                   provided  in the request, the value does not match. For ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing lists and maps.  AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  of type String, Number, Binary, String
                   Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an  At-
                   tributeValue  of  a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE : Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT : Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element  of  a
                   different  type  than  the one provided in the request, the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  con-
                   tain  only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  element of type String, Number, or Bi-
                   nary (not a set type). If an item  contains  an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This  operator  tests  for the existence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result is
                     a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute  "a
                     "  exists;  its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and  you  evaluate it using NULL , the result is a
                     Boolean false . This is because the attribute  "a  "  ex-
                     ists;  its data type is not relevant to the NULL compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or  value  in  a  set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the  target  attribute of the comparison is of type String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the  input.  If the target attribute of the comparison is a
                   set ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates
                   to  true  if it finds an exact match with any member of the
                   set. CONTAINS is supported for lists:  When  evaluating  "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or  ab-
                   sence  of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not  a  set  type). If the target attribute of the
                   comparison is a String, then the operator  checks  for  the
                   absence  of  a  substring match. If the target attribute of
                   the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for  the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put. If the target attribute of the  comparison  is  a  set
                   ("SS  ",  "NS  ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates to
                   true if it does not find an exact match with any member  of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b  "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain only one AttributeValue of type  String  or  Binary
                   (not  a  Number or a set type). The target attribute of the
                   comparison must be of type String or Binary (not  a  Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList can contain one or more AttributeValue  elements  of
                   type  String,  Number, or Binary. These attributes are com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to  the  first  value,  and
                   less  than  or  equal  to the second value.   AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type,  either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A
                   target attribute matches if the  target  value  is  greater
                   than,  or  equal  to,  the  first element and less than, or
                   equal to, the second element. If an item  contains  an  At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  . Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

       --conditional-operator (string)
          This is a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead.  For  more
          information,  see  ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB Devel-
          oper Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --scan-index-forward | --no-scan-index-forward (boolean)
          Specifies the order for index traversal: If true (default), the tra-
          versal  is performed in ascending order; if false , the traversal is
          performed in descending order.

          Items with the same partition key value are stored in  sorted  order
          by  sort  key.  If the sort key data type is Number, the results are
          stored in numeric order. For type String, the results are stored  in
          order  of UTF-8 bytes. For type Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of
          the binary data as unsigned.

          If ScanIndexForward is true , DynamoDB returns the  results  in  the
          order  in which they are stored (by sort key value). This is the de-
          fault behavior. If ScanIndexForward is false ,  DynamoDB  reads  the
          results in reverse order by sort key value, and then returns the re-
          sults to the client.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the operation, together with ConsumedCapacity for each  table  and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these  cases, specifying INDEXES will only return ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL - The response includes only the aggregate  ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --projection-expression (string)
          A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the
          table. These attributes can include scalars, sets, or elements of  a
          JSON document. The attributes in the expression must be separated by
          commas.

          If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be re-
          turned.  If any of the requested attributes are not found, they will
          not appear in the result.

          For more information, see Accessing Item Attributes  in  the  Amazon
          DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --filter-expression (string)
          A  string  that  contains conditions that DynamoDB applies after the
          Query operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items  that
          do not satisfy the FilterExpression criteria are not returned.

          A  FilterExpression does not allow key attributes. You cannot define
          a filter expression based on a partition key or a sort key.

          NOTE:
              A FilterExpression is applied after the items have already  been
              read;  the  process of filtering does not consume any additional
              read capacity units.

          For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon  DynamoDB
          Developer Guide .

       --key-condition-expression (string)
          The  condition  that  specifies  the  key values for items to be re-
          trieved by the Query action.

          The condition must perform an equality test on  a  single  partition
          key value.

          The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests
          on a single sort key value. This allows Query to retrieve  one  item
          with  a  given  partition  key  value and sort key value, or several
          items that have the same partition key value but different sort  key
          values.

          The  partition  key equality test is required, and must be specified
          in the following format:
              partitionKeyName  =  :partitionkeyval

          If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be
          combined using AND with the condition for the sort key. Following is
          an example, using the = comparison operator for the sort key:
              partitionKeyName   =   :partitionkeyval   AND   sortKeyName    =
              :sortkeyval

          Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:

          o sortKeyName   =  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal
            to :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName  <  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value  is  less
            than :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName   <=  :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less
            than or equal to :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName  >  :sortkeyval -  true  if  the  sort  key  value  is
            greater than :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName   >=   :sortkeyval  -  true  if  the sort key value is
            greater than or equal to :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName  BETWEEN  :sortkeyval1  AND  :sortkeyval2  -  true  if
            the  sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1 , and
            less than or equal to :sortkeyval2 .

          o begins_with (  sortKeyName , :sortkeyval  ) - true if the sort key
            value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this func-
            tion with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the  func-
            tion name begins_with is case-sensitive.

          Use  the  ExpressionAttributeValues parameter to replace tokens such
          as :partitionval and :sortval with actual values at runtime.

          You can optionally use the ExpressionAttributeNames parameter to re-
          place  the  names of the partition key and sort key with placeholder
          tokens. This option might be necessary if  an  attribute  name  con-
          flicts  with  a  DynamoDB  reserved word. For example, the following
          KeyConditionExpression parameter causes an error because Size  is  a
          reserved word:

          o Size = :myval

          To  work around this, define a placeholder (such a #S ) to represent
          the attribute name Size . KeyConditionExpression then is as follows:

          o #S = :myval

          For a list of reserved words, see Reserved Words in the  Amazon  Dy-
          namoDB Developer Guide .

          For  more  information on ExpressionAttributeNames and ExpressionAt-
          tributeValues , see Using Placeholders for Attribute Names and  Val-
          ues in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --expression-attribute-names (map)
          One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in an expres-
          sion. The following are  some  use  cases  for  using  ExpressionAt-
          tributeNames :

          o To  access  an  attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB re-
            served word.

          o To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an  attribute
            name in an expression.

          o To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being mis-
            interpreted in an expression.

          Use the # character in an expression  to  dereference  an  attribute
          name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

          o Percentile

          The  name  of  this  attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
          cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list  of
          reserved  words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide ). To work around this, you could specify  the  following  for
          ExpressionAttributeNames :

          o {"#P":"Percentile"}

          You  could  then  use this substitution in an expression, as in this
          example:

          o #P = :val

          NOTE:
              Tokens that begin with the : character are expression  attribute
              values , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

          For  more  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying
          Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expression-attribute-values (map)
          One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

          Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference  an  at-
          tribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
          the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:
              Available | Backordered | Discontinued

          You would first need to specify  ExpressionAttributeValues  as  fol-
          lows:
              {    ":avail":{"S":"Available"},    ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
              ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }

          You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
              ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)

          For more information on expression attribute values, see  Specifying
          Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To query a table

       The following query example queries items in the MusicCollection table.
       The table has a hash-and-range primary key (Artist and SongTitle),  but
       this query only specifies the hash key value. It returns song titles by
       the artist named "No One You Know".

          aws dynamodb query \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --projection-expression "SongTitle" \
              --key-condition-expression "Artist = :v1" \
              --expression-attribute-values file://expression-attributes.json \

       Example  2:  To  query a table using strongly consistent reads and tra-
       verse the index in descending order

       The following example performs the same query as the first example, but
       returns results in reverse order and uses strongly consistent reads.

          aws dynamodb query \
              --table-name MusicCollection \

       Example 3: To filter out specific results

       The following example queries the MusicCollection but excludes  results
       with  specific  values in the AlbumTitle attribute. Note that this does
       not affect the ScannedCount or ConsumedCapacity, because the filter  is
       applied after the items have been read.

          aws dynamodb query \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --key-condition-expression "#n1 = :v1" \

       Example 4: To retrieve only an item count

       The following example retrieves a count of items  matching  the  query,
       but does not retrieve any of the items themselves.

          aws dynamodb query \
              --table-name MusicCollection \

       Example 5: To query an index

       The following example queries the local secondary  index  AlbumTitleIn-
       dex.  The  query  returns  all attributes from the base table that have
       been projected into the local secondary index. Note that when  querying
       a  local  secondary index or global secondary index, you must also pro-
       vide the name of the base table using the table-name parameter.

          aws dynamodb query \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --index-name AlbumTitleIndex \
              --key-condition-expression "Artist = :v1" \

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          An array of item attributes that match the query criteria. Each ele-
          ment in this array consists of an attribute name and the  value  for
          that attribute.

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair. The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 For more information, see Data Types in the  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                        "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                 SS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                        "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                     (string)

                 NS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as

                 BS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                        "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                     (blob)

                 M -> (map)

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the

                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                        B -> (blob)
                            An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                        SS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                               "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                            (string)

                        NS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                               "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-

                            (string)

                        BS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                               "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                            (blob)

                        M -> (map)
                            An attribute of type Map. For example:
                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            key -> (string)

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        L -> (list)
                            An attribute of type List. For example:
                               "L":  [  {"S":  "Cookies"}  ,  {"S": "Coffee"},
                               {"N": "3.14159"}]

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:

                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

       Count -> (integer)
          The number of items in the response.

          If you used a QueryFilter in the request, then Count is  the  number
          of  items returned after the filter was applied, and ScannedCount is
          the number of matching items before the filter was applied.

          If you did not use a filter in the request, then Count and  Scanned-
          Count are the same.

       ScannedCount -> (integer)
          The  number of items evaluated, before any QueryFilter is applied. A
          high ScannedCount value with few, or no, Count results indicates  an
          inefficient  Query  operation.  For  more information, see Count and
          ScannedCount in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          If you did not use a filter in the request, then ScannedCount is the
          same as Count .

       LastEvaluatedKey -> (map)
          The  primary  key of the item where the operation stopped, inclusive
          of the previous result set. Use this value to start a new operation,
          excluding this value in the new request.

          If  LastEvaluatedKey  is  empty, then the "last page" of results has
          been processed and there is no more data to be retrieved.

          If LastEvaluatedKey is not empty, it does not necessarily mean  that
          there  is more data in the result set. The only way to know when you
          have reached the end of the result set is when  LastEvaluatedKey  is
          empty.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}
