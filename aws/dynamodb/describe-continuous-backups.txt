DESCRIBE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()                    DESCRIBE-CONTINUOUS-BACKUPS()



NAME
       describe-continuous-backups -

DESCRIPTION
       Checks  the  status of continuous backups and point in time recovery on
       the specified table. Continuous backups are ENABLED on  all  tables  at
       table creation. If point in time recovery is enabled, PointInTimeRecov-
       eryStatus will be set to ENABLED.

       After continuous backups and point in time recovery  are  enabled,  you
       can  restore to any point in time within EarliestRestorableDateTime and
       LatestRestorableDateTime .
          LatestRestorableDateTime is typically 5 minutes before  the  current
          time.  You  can  restore  your table to any point in time during the
          last 35 days.

       You can call DescribeContinuousBackups at a maximum rate  of  10  times
       per second.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-continuous-backups
          --table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          Name of the table for which the customer wants to check the continu-
          ous backups and point in time recovery settings.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about continuous backups for a DynamoDB table

       The  following  describe-continuous-backups  example  displays  details
       about the continuous backup settings for the MusicCollection table.

          aws dynamodb describe-continuous-backups \
              --table-name MusicCollection

       Output:

          {
              "ContinuousBackupsDescription": {
                  "ContinuousBackupsStatus": "ENABLED",
                  "PointInTimeRecoveryDescription": {
                      "PointInTimeRecoveryStatus": "DISABLED"
                  }
              }
          }

       Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       ContinuousBackupsDescription -> (structure)
          Represents the continuous backups and point in  time  recovery  set-
          tings on the table.

          ContinuousBackupsStatus -> (string)
              ContinuousBackupsStatus  can be one of the following states: EN-
              ABLED, DISABLED

          PointInTimeRecoveryDescription -> (structure)
              The description of the point in time recovery  settings  applied
              to the table.

              PointInTimeRecoveryStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of point in time recovery:

                 o ENABLING - Point in time recovery is being enabled.

                 o ENABLED - Point in time recovery is enabled.

                 o DISABLED - Point in time recovery is disabled.

              EarliestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the earliest point in time you can restore your ta-
                 ble to. You can restore your table to any point in time  dur-
                 ing the last 35 days.

              LatestRestorableDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 LatestRestorableDateTime  is  typically  5 minutes before the
                 current time.
