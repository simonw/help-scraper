CREATE-TABLE()                                                  CREATE-TABLE()



NAME
       create-table -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateTable operation adds a new table to your account. In an Ama-
       zon Web Services account, table names must be unique  within  each  Re-
       gion. That is, you can have two tables with same name if you create the
       tables in different Regions.
          CreateTable is an asynchronous  operation.  Upon  receiving  a  Cre-
          ateTable request, DynamoDB immediately returns a response with a Ta-
          bleStatus of CREATING . After the table is  created,  DynamoDB  sets
          the  TableStatus  to  ACTIVE . You can perform read and write opera-
          tions only on an ACTIVE table.

       You can optionally define secondary indexes on the new table,  as  part
       of  the  CreateTable  operation.  If you want to create multiple tables
       with secondary indexes on them, you  must  create  the  tables  sequen-
       tially.  Only  one  table with secondary indexes can be in the CREATING
       state at any given time.

       You can use the DescribeTable action to check the table status.

OPTIONS
       --attribute-definitions (list)
          An array of attributes that describe the key schema  for  the  table
          and indexes.

          (structure)
              Represents  an  attribute  for describing the key schema for the
              table and indexes.

              AttributeName -> (string)
                 A name for the attribute.

              AttributeType -> (string)
                 The data type for the attribute, where:

                 o S - the attribute is of type String

                 o N - the attribute is of type Number

                 o B - the attribute is of type Binary

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributeName": "string",
              "AttributeType": "S"|"N"|"B"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table to create.

       --key-schema (list)
          Specifies the attributes that make up the primary key for a table or
          an  index.  The  attributes in KeySchema must also be defined in the
          AttributeDefinitions array. For more information, see Data Model  in
          the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          Each KeySchemaElement in the array is composed of:

          o AttributeName - The name of this key attribute.

          o KeyType - The role that the key attribute will assume:

            o HASH - partition key

            o RANGE - sort key

          NOTE:
              The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute
              . The term "hash attribute" derives from the DynamoDB  usage  of
              an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across
              partitions, based on their partition key values.

              The sort key of an item is also known as its range  attribute  .
              The  term "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB stores
              items with the same partition key physically close together,  in
              sorted order by the sort key value.

          For  a  simple primary key (partition key), you must provide exactly
          one element with a KeyType of HASH .

          For a composite primary key (partition key and sort key),  you  must
          provide  exactly two elements, in this order: The first element must
          have a KeyType of HASH , and the second element must have a  KeyType
          of RANGE .

          For more information, see Working with Tables in the Amazon DynamoDB
          Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema speci-
              fies  the attributes that make up the primary key of a table, or
              the key attributes of an index.

              A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of the  pri-
              mary key. For example, a simple primary key would be represented
              by one KeySchemaElement (for the  partition  key).  A  composite
              primary key would require one KeySchemaElement for the partition
              key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

              A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not  a
              nested  attribute). The data type must be one of String, Number,
              or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested within  a  List  or  a
              Map.

              AttributeName -> (string)
                 The name of a key attribute.

              KeyType -> (string)
                 The role that this key attribute will assume:

                 o HASH - partition key

                 o RANGE - sort key

                 NOTE:
                     The  partition  key  of an item is also known as its hash
                     attribute . The term "hash attribute"  derives  from  Dy-
                     namoDB's  usage  of  an  internal hash function to evenly
                     distribute data items across partitions, based  on  their
                     partition key values.

                     The sort key of an item is also known as its range attri-
                     bute . The term "range attribute" derives  from  the  way
                     DynamoDB  stores items with the same partition key physi-
                     cally close together, in sorted order  by  the  sort  key
                     value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,KeyType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributeName": "string",
              "KeyType": "HASH"|"RANGE"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --local-secondary-indexes (list)
          One or more local secondary indexes (the maximum is 5) to be created
          on the table. Each index is scoped to a given partition  key  value.
          There  is a 10 GB size limit per partition key value; otherwise, the
          size of a local secondary index is unconstrained.

          Each local secondary index in the array includes the following:

          o IndexName - The name of the local secondary index. Must be  unique
            only for this table.

          o KeySchema  -  Specifies the key schema for the local secondary in-
            dex. The key schema must begin with the same partition key as  the
            table.

          o Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from
            the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key
            attributes  and index key attributes, which are automatically pro-
            jected. Each attribute specification is composed of:

            o ProjectionType - One of the following:

              o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into
                the index.

              o INCLUDE  -  Only  the specified table attributes are projected
                into the index. The list of projected attributes is in NonKey-
                Attributes .

              o ALL  -  All of the table attributes are projected into the in-
                dex.

            o NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names
              that  are projected into the secondary index. The total count of
              attributes provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed across  all  of
              the  secondary  indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the
              same attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as  two
              distinct attributes when determining the total.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  local  secondary  index. The name must be
                 unique among all other indexes on this table.

              KeySchema -> (list)
                 The complete key schema for the local secondary  index,  con-
                 sisting  of  one  or  more  pairs  of attribute names and key
                 types:

                 o HASH - partition key

                 o RANGE - sort key

                 NOTE:
                     The partition key of an item is also known  as  its  hash
                     attribute  .  The  term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                     namoDB's usage of an internal  hash  function  to  evenly
                     distribute  data  items across partitions, based on their
                     partition key values.

                     The sort key of an item is also known as its range attri-
                     bute  .  The  term "range attribute" derives from the way
                     DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key  physi-
                     cally  close  together,  in  sorted order by the sort key
                     value.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema
                     specifies  the attributes that make up the primary key of
                     a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                     A KeySchemaElement represents exactly  one  attribute  of
                     the  primary key. For example, a simple primary key would
                     be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition
                     key).   A   composite   primary  key  would  require  one
                     KeySchemaElement  for  the  partition  key,  and  another
                     KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                     A  KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute
                     (not a nested attribute). The data type must  be  one  of
                     String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested
                     within a List or a Map.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of a key attribute.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The role that this key attribute will assume:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The partition key of an item is also known as  its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute  .  The  term  "range attribute" derives
                            from the way DynamoDB stores items with  the  same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

              Projection -> (structure)
                 Represents attributes that are copied  (projected)  from  the
                 table  into  the local secondary index. These are in addition
                 to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which
                 are automatically projected.

                 ProjectionType -> (string)
                     The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                     o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only  the index and primary keys are pro-
                       jected into the index.

                     o INCLUDE - In addition to the  attributes  described  in
                       KEYS_ONLY  ,  the  secondary  index  will include other
                       non-key attributes that you specify.

                     o ALL - All of the table attributes  are  projected  into
                       the index.

                 NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                     Represents the non-key attribute names which will be pro-
                     jected into the index.

                     For local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAt-
                     tributes  summed  across  all  of the local secondary in-
                     dexes, must not exceed 20. If you project the same attri-
                     bute  into two different indexes, this counts as two dis-
                     tinct attributes when determining the total.

          ]

       --global-secondary-indexes (list)
          One or more global secondary indexes (the maximum is 20) to be  cre-
          ated on the table. Each global secondary index in the array includes
          the following:

          o IndexName - The name of the global secondary index. Must be unique
            only for this table.

          o KeySchema  - Specifies the key schema for the global secondary in-
            dex.

          o Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected) from
            the table into the index. These are in addition to the primary key
            attributes and index key attributes, which are automatically  pro-
            jected. Each attribute specification is composed of:

            o ProjectionType - One of the following:

              o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are projected into
                the index.

              o INCLUDE - Only the specified table  attributes  are  projected
                into the index. The list of projected attributes is in NonKey-
                Attributes .

              o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into  the  in-
                dex.

            o NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more non-key attribute names
              that are projected into the secondary index. The total count  of
              attributes  provided  in NonKeyAttributes , summed across all of
              the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If you  project  the
              same  attribute  into  two different indexes, this counts as two
              distinct attributes when determining the total.

          o ProvisionedThroughput - The provisioned  throughput  settings  for
            the  global secondary index, consisting of read and write capacity
            units.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

              IndexName -> (string)
                 The name of the global secondary  index.  The  name  must  be
                 unique among all other indexes on this table.

              KeySchema -> (list)
                 The  complete  key schema for a global secondary index, which
                 consists of one or more pairs  of  attribute  names  and  key
                 types:

                 o HASH - partition key

                 o RANGE - sort key

                 NOTE:
                     The  partition  key  of an item is also known as its hash
                     attribute . The term "hash attribute"  derives  from  Dy-
                     namoDB's  usage  of  an  internal hash function to evenly
                     distribute data items across partitions, based  on  their
                     partition key values.

                     The sort key of an item is also known as its range attri-
                     bute . The term "range attribute" derives  from  the  way
                     DynamoDB  stores items with the same partition key physi-
                     cally close together, in sorted order  by  the  sort  key
                     value.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema
                     specifies the attributes that make up the primary key  of
                     a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                     A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of
                     the primary key. For example, a simple primary key  would
                     be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition
                     key).  A  composite  primary  key   would   require   one
                     KeySchemaElement  for  the  partition  key,  and  another
                     KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                     A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attribute
                     (not  a  nested  attribute). The data type must be one of
                     String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested
                     within a List or a Map.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of a key attribute.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The role that this key attribute will assume:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The  partition key of an item is also known as its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"  derives
                            from  the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

              Projection -> (structure)
                 Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from the
                 table into the global secondary index. These are in  addition
                 to the primary key attributes and index key attributes, which
                 are automatically projected.

                 ProjectionType -> (string)
                     The set of attributes that are projected into the index:

                     o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary  keys  are  pro-
                       jected into the index.

                     o INCLUDE  -  In  addition to the attributes described in
                       KEYS_ONLY , the  secondary  index  will  include  other
                       non-key attributes that you specify.

                     o ALL  -  All  of the table attributes are projected into
                       the index.

                 NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                     Represents the non-key attribute names which will be pro-
                     jected into the index.

                     For local secondary indexes, the total count of NonKeyAt-
                     tributes summed across all of  the  local  secondary  in-
                     dexes, must not exceed 20. If you project the same attri-
                     bute into two different indexes, this counts as two  dis-
                     tinct attributes when determining the total.

                     (string)

              ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                 Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the speci-
                 fied global secondary index.

                 For current minimum and maximum provisioned  throughput  val-
                 ues, see Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon Dy-
                 namoDB Developer Guide .

                 ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum number of strongly consistent reads  consumed
                     per  second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException
                     . For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Re-
                     quirements in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value
                     is set to 0.

                 WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum number of writes consumed per  second  before
                     DynamoDB  returns a ThrottlingException . For more infor-
                     mation, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value
                     is set to 0.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          IndexName=string,KeySchema=[{AttributeName=string,KeyType=string},{AttributeName=string,KeyType=string}],Projection={ProjectionType=string,NonKeyAttributes=[string,string]},ProvisionedThroughput={ReadCapacityUnits=long,WriteCapacityUnits=long} ...

            ...
          ]

       --billing-mode (string)
          Controls how you are charged for read and write throughput  and  how
          you manage capacity. This setting can be changed later.

          o PROVISIONED - We recommend using PROVISIONED for predictable work-
            loads. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to Provisioned Mode .

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST - We recommend using  PAY_PER_REQUEST  for  unpre-
            dictable  workloads.  PAY_PER_REQUEST  sets  the  billing  mode to
            On-Demand Mode .

          Possible values:

          o PROVISIONED

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST

       --provisioned-throughput (structure)
          Represents the provisioned throughput settings for a specified table
          or  index. The settings can be modified using the UpdateTable opera-
          tion.

          If you set BillingMode as PROVISIONED , you must specify this  prop-
          erty. If you set BillingMode as PAY_PER_REQUEST , you cannot specify
          this property.

          For current minimum and maximum provisioned throughput  values,  see
          Service,  Account, and Table Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide .

          ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
              The maximum number of strongly  consistent  reads  consumed  per
              second  before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . For more
              information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements  in  the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set
              to 0.

          WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
              The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB
              returns  a  ThrottlingException  .  For  more  information,  see
              Specifying Read and Write Requirements in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB

       --stream-specification (structure)
          The settings for DynamoDB Streams on the table. These settings  con-
          sist of:

          o StreamEnabled  -  Indicates  whether DynamoDB Streams is to be en-
            abled (true) or disabled (false).

          o StreamViewType  -  When  an  item  in  the  table   is   modified,
            StreamViewType  determines  what information is written to the ta-
            ble's stream. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

            o KEYS_ONLY - Only the key attributes of  the  modified  item  are
              written to the stream.

            o NEW_IMAGE  -  The  entire item, as it appears after it was modi-
              fied, is written to the stream.

            o OLD_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appeared before it was  modi-
              fied, is written to the stream.

            o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old item images of the
              item are written to the stream.

          StreamEnabled -> (boolean)

              (false) on the table.

          StreamViewType -> (string)
              When an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType determines
              what information is written to the stream for this table.  Valid
              values for StreamViewType are:

              o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only the key attributes of the modified item are
                written to the stream.

                fied, is written to the stream.

              o OLD_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appeared before it was mod-
                ified, is written to the stream.

              o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old item  images  of
                the item are written to the stream.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StreamEnabled=boolean,StreamViewType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StreamEnabled": true|false,

          }

       --sse-specification (structure)
          Represents the settings used to enable server-side encryption.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon
              Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If
              enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to KMS and an
              Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply).  If
              disabled (false) or not specified, server-side encryption is set
              to Amazon Web Services owned key.

          SSEType -> (string)
              Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

              o KMS - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service.
                The  key  is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS
                charges apply).

          KMSMasterKeyId -> (string)
              The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To spec-
              ify  a  key,  use  its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias
              name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide  this  pa-
              rameter  if  the  key is different from the default DynamoDB key
              alias/aws/dynamodb .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,SSEType=string,KMSMasterKeyId=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "KMSMasterKeyId": "string"
          }

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the table. For more  information,
          see Tagging for DynamoDB .

          (structure)
              Describes a tag. A tag is a key-value pair. You can add up to 50
              tags to a single DynamoDB table.

              Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names and values are  automati-
              cally  assigned  the  aws: prefix, which the user cannot assign.
              Amazon Web Services-assigned tag names do not count towards  the
              tag  limit  of 50. User-assigned tag names have the prefix user:
              in the Cost Allocation Report. You cannot backdate the  applica-
              tion of a tag.

              For  an  overview on tagging DynamoDB resources, see Tagging for
              DynamoDB in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are  case  sensitive.  Each  Dy-
                 namoDB  table  can only have up to one tag with the same key.
                 If you try to add an existing tag (same  key),  the  existing
                 tag value will be updated to the new value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. Tag values are case-sensitive and can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --table-class (string)
          The table class of the new table.  Valid  values  are  STANDARD  and
          STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a table with tags

       The following create-table example uses the  specified  attributes  and
       key  schema  to  create  a table named MusicCollection. This table uses
       provisioned throughput and is encrypted at rest using the  default  AWS
       owned  CMK.  The command also applies a tag to the table, with a key of
       Owner and a value of blueTeam.

          aws dynamodb create-table \
              --table-name MusicCollection \

       Example 2: To create a table in On-Demand Mode

       The  following  example  creates  a  table called MusicCollection using
       on-demand mode, rather than provisioned throughput mode. This is useful
       for tables with unpredictable workloads.

          aws dynamodb create-table \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --attribute-definitions AttributeName=Artist,AttributeType=S AttributeName=SongTitle,AttributeType=S \
              --key-schema AttributeName=Artist,KeyType=HASH AttributeName=SongTitle,KeyType=RANGE \
              --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST

       The  following example creates a table named GameScores with two Global
       Secondary Indexes. The GSI schemas are passed via a file,  rather  than
       on the command line.

          aws dynamodb create-table \
              --table-name GameScores \
              --attribute-definitions AttributeName=UserId,AttributeType=S AttributeName=GameTitle,AttributeType=S AttributeName=TopScore,AttributeType=N AttributeName=Date,AttributeType=S \
              --key-schema AttributeName=UserId,KeyType=HASH AttributeName=GameTitle,KeyType=RANGE \
              --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=10,WriteCapacityUnits=5 \
              --global-secondary-indexes file://gsi.json

       Example 7: To create a table with Streams enabled

       The following example creates a table called GameScores  with  DynamoDB
       Streams  enabled.  Both new and old images of each item will be written
       to the stream.

OUTPUT
       TableDescription -> (structure)
          Represents the properties of the table.

          AttributeDefinitions -> (list)
              An  array  of AttributeDefinition objects. Each of these objects
              describes one attribute in the table and index key schema.

              Each AttributeDefinition object in this array is composed of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o AttributeType - The data type for the attribute.

              (structure)
                 Represents an attribute for describing the key schema for the
                 table and indexes.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     A name for the attribute.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type for the attribute, where:

                     o S - the attribute is of type String

                     o N - the attribute is of type Number

                     o B - the attribute is of type Binary

          TableName -> (string)
              The name of the table.

          KeySchema -> (list)
              The  primary  key structure for the table. Each KeySchemaElement
              consists of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o KeyType - The role of the attribute:

                o HASH - partition key

                o RANGE - sort key

              NOTE:
                 The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attri-
                 bute  . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's us-
                 age of an internal hash function to  evenly  distribute  data
                 items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                 The  sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute
                 . The term "range attribute" derives from  the  way  DynamoDB
                 stores items with the same partition key physically close to-
                 gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in  the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              (structure)
                 Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key schema
                 specifies the attributes that make up the primary  key  of  a
                 table, or the key attributes of an index.

                 A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of the
                 primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be  rep-
                 resented  by  one KeySchemaElement (for the partition key). A
                 composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement  for
                 the  partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort
                 key.

                 A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not
                 a  nested  attribute).  The  data type must be one of String,
                 Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be  nested  within  a
                 List or a Map.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of a key attribute.

                 KeyType -> (string)
                     The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's  usage of an internal hash function to evenly
                        distribute data  items  across  partitions,  based  on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute . The term "range attribute" derives from  the
                        way  DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

          TableStatus -> (string)
              The current state of the table:

              o CREATING - The table is being created.

              o UPDATING - The table is being updated.

              o DELETING - The table is being deleted.

              o ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

              o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used to en-
                crypt the table in inaccessible. Table operations may fail due
                to  failure to use the KMS key. DynamoDB will initiate the ta-
                ble archival process when a table's KMS key remains inaccessi-
                ble for more than seven days.

              o ARCHIVING  -  The  table is being archived. Operations are not
                allowed until archival is complete.

              o ARCHIVED - The table has been archived. See the ArchivalReason
                for more information.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the table was created, in UNIX epoch time
              format.

          ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
              The provisioned throughput settings for the table, consisting of
              read  and  write capacity units, along with data about increases
              and decreases.

              LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase
                 for this table.

              LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease
                 for this table.

              NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                 The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table
                 during  this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on provi-
                 sioned throughput decreases, see Service, Account, and  Table
                 Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The  maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per
                 second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .  Even-
                 tually  consistent  reads  require  less effort than strongly
                 consistent reads, so a setting of  50  ReadCapacityUnits  per
                 second  provides  100 eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits
                 per second.

              WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The maximum number of writes consumed per second  before  Dy-
                 namoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

          TableSizeBytes -> (long)
              The  total  size  of the specified table, in bytes. DynamoDB up-
              dates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent  changes
              might not be reflected in this value.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The  number  of  items  in the specified table. DynamoDB updates
              this value approximately every six hours. Recent  changes  might
              not be reflected in this value.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the ta-
              ble.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique identifier for the table for which the  backup  was  cre-
              ated.

          BillingModeSummary -> (structure)
              Contains the details for the read/write capacity mode.

              BillingMode -> (string)
                 Controls  how  you  are charged for read and write throughput
                 and how you manage capacity.  This  setting  can  be  changed
                 later.

                 o PROVISIONED  -  Sets the read/write capacity mode to PROVI-
                   SIONED . We recommend  using  PROVISIONED  for  predictable
                   workloads.

                 o PAY_PER_REQUEST  -  Sets  the  read/write  capacity mode to
                   PAY_PER_REQUEST . We recommend  using  PAY_PER_REQUEST  for
                   unpredictable workloads.

              LastUpdateToPayPerRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Represents  the time when PAY_PER_REQUEST was last set as the
                 read/write capacity mode.

          LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              Represents one or more local secondary  indexes  on  the  table.
              Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. Tables with
              one or more local secondary indexes are subject to an item  col-
              lection size limit, where the amount of data within a given item
              collection cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:

              o IndexName - The name of the local secondary index.

              o KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema.  The  at-
                tribute  names  in  the  key  schema must be between 1 and 255
                characters (inclusive). The key schema  must  begin  with  the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection  - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
                from the table into the index. These are in  addition  to  the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically projected. Each attribute  specification  is  com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE - Only the specified  table  attributes  are  pro-
                    jected into the index. The list of projected attributes is
                    in NonKeyAttributes .

                  o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected  into  the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes  -  A list of one or more non-key attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count  of  attributes  provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 20.  If
                  you  project  the same attribute into two different indexes,
                  this counts as two distinct attributes when determining  the
                  total.

              o IndexSizeBytes  -  Represents  the total size of the index, in
                bytes. DynamoDB updates this  value  approximately  every  six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o ItemCount  -  Represents the number of items in the index. Dy-
                namoDB updates this value approximately every six  hours.  Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              If  the table is in the DELETING state, no information about in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     Represents the name of the local secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The complete key schema for the  local  secondary  index,
                     consisting  of  one  or more pairs of attribute names and
                     key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a single element of a  key  schema.  A  key
                        schema  specifies the attributes that make up the pri-
                        mary key of a table, or the key attributes of  an  in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the primary key. For example,  a  simple  primary  key
                        would  be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the
                        partition key). A composite primary key would  require
                        one  KeySchemaElement  for  the partition key, and an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attri-
                        bute  (not  a nested attribute). The data type must be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The  partition  key of an item is also known as
                               its hash attribute . The term "hash  attribute"
                               derives  from  DynamoDB's  usage of an internal
                               hash function to evenly distribute  data  items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The sort key of an item is also  known  as  its
                               range  attribute  .  The term "range attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the  same  partition  key  physically close to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents attributes that are  copied  (projected)  from
                     the  table  into the global secondary index. These are in
                     addition to the primary key attributes and index key  at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The  set of attributes that are projected into the in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will  include  other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents the non-key attribute names which  will  be
                        projected into the index.

                        For  local  secondary indexes, the total count of Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes,  must  not exceed 20. If you project the same
                        attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The  number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB up-
                     dates this value approximately every  six  hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies
                     the index.

          GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table.  Each  index
              is  scoped  to a given partition key value. Each element is com-
              posed of:

              o Backfilling - If true, then the  index  is  currently  in  the
                backfilling  phase.  Backfilling occurs only when a new global
                secondary index is added to the table. It is  the  process  by
                which  DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the ta-
                ble. (This attribute does not appear  for  indexes  that  were
                created  during  a  CreateTable operation.)  You can delete an
                index that is being created during the Backfilling phase  when
                IndexStatus  is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is true. You
                can't delete the index that is being created when  IndexStatus
                is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is false. (This attribute
                does not appear for indexes that were created  during  a  Cre-
                ateTable operation.)

              o IndexName - The name of the global secondary index.

              o IndexSizeBytes - The total size of the global secondary index,
                in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every  six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o IndexStatus  -  The current status of the global secondary in-
                dex:

                o CREATING - The index is being created.

                o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

              o ItemCount - The number of items in the global secondary index.
                DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema.  The  at-
                tribute  names  in  the  key  schema must be between 1 and 255
                characters (inclusive). The key schema  must  begin  with  the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection  - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
                from the table into the index. These are in  addition  to  the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically projected. Each attribute  specification  is  com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE - In  addition  to  the  attributes  described  in
                    KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will include other non-key
                    attributes that you specify.

                  o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected  into  the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes  -  A list of one or more non-key attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count  of  attributes  provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 20.  If
                  you  project  the same attribute into two different indexes,
                  this counts as two distinct attributes when determining  the
                  total.

              o ProvisionedThroughput  -  The  provisioned throughput settings
                for the global secondary index, consisting of read  and  write
                capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.

              If  the table is in the DELETING state, no information about in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The complete key schema for  a  global  secondary  index,
                     which  consists  of  one or more pairs of attribute names
                     and key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a single element of a  key  schema.  A  key
                        schema  specifies the attributes that make up the pri-
                        mary key of a table, or the key attributes of  an  in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the primary key. For example,  a  simple  primary  key
                        would  be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the
                        partition key). A composite primary key would  require
                        one  KeySchemaElement  for  the partition key, and an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attri-
                        bute  (not  a nested attribute). The data type must be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The  partition  key of an item is also known as
                               its hash attribute . The term "hash  attribute"
                               derives  from  DynamoDB's  usage of an internal
                               hash function to evenly distribute  data  items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The sort key of an item is also  known  as  its
                               range  attribute  .  The term "range attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the  same  partition  key  physically close to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents attributes that are  copied  (projected)  from
                     the  table  into the global secondary index. These are in
                     addition to the primary key attributes and index key  at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The  set of attributes that are projected into the in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will  include  other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents the non-key attribute names which  will  be
                        projected into the index.

                        For  local  secondary indexes, the total count of Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes,  must  not exceed 20. If you project the same
                        attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the global secondary index:

                     o CREATING - The index is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

                 Backfilling -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the  index  is currently backfilling.
                     Backfilling is the process of reading items from the  ta-
                     ble  and determining whether they can be added to the in-
                     dex. (Not all items will qualify: For example,  a  parti-
                     tion  key  cannot  have any duplicate values.) If an item
                     can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all
                     items  have  been processed, the backfilling operation is
                     complete and Backfilling is false.

                     You can delete an index that is being created during  the
                     Backfilling phase when IndexStatus is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling is true. You can't delete the index  that  is
                     being  created  when  IndexStatus  is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling is false.

                     NOTE:
                        For indexes that were created during a CreateTable op-
                        eration,  the Backfilling attribute does not appear in
                        the DescribeTable output.

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents the provisioned throughput  settings  for  the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For  current  minimum  and maximum provisioned throughput
                     values, see Service, Account, and  Table  Quotas  in  the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time of the last provisioned throughput
                        increase for this table.

                     LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time of the last  provisioned  throughput
                        decrease for this table.

                     NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                        The  number  of  provisioned  throughput decreases for
                        this table during this UTC calendar day.  For  current
                        maximums  on  provisioned  throughput  decreases,  see
                        Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the  Amazon  Dy-
                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of strongly consistent reads con-
                        sumed per second  before  DynamoDB  returns  a  Throt-
                        tlingException  .  Eventually consistent reads require
                        less effort than strongly consistent reads, so a  set-
                        ting  of  50 ReadCapacityUnits per second provides 100
                        eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The maximum number of writes consumed per  second  be-
                        fore DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The  number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB up-
                     dates this value approximately every  six  hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies
                     the index.

          StreamSpecification -> (structure)
              The current DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.

              StreamEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or  dis-
                 abled (false) on the table.

              StreamViewType -> (string)
                 When  an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType deter-
                 mines what information is written to the stream for this  ta-
                 ble. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

                 o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only  the key attributes of the modified item
                   are written to the stream.

                 o NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it  appears  after  it  was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o OLD_IMAGE  -  The entire item, as it appeared before it was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old  item  images
                   of the item are written to the stream.

          LatestStreamLabel -> (string)
              A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

              Note  that  LatestStreamLabel is not a unique identifier for the
              stream, because it is possible that a stream from another  table
              might  have  the same timestamp. However, the combination of the
              following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

              o Amazon Web Services customer ID

              o Table name

              o StreamLabel

          LatestStreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the lat-
              est stream for this table.

          GlobalTableVersion -> (string)
              Represents  the version of global tables in use, if the table is
              replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions.

              Represents replicas of the table.

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED - The replica is  inaccessible  because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for more than 20  hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this
                        replica  from  the replication group. The replica will
                        not be deleted and replication will stop from  and  to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If the KMS key remains inaccessible for more  than  20
                        hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this  replica from the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 ReplicaStatusDescription -> (string)
                     Detailed information about the replica status.

                 ReplicaStatusPercentProgress -> (string)
                     Specifies the progress of a Create, Update, or Delete ac-
                     tion on the replica as a percentage.

                 KMSMasterKeyId -> (string)
                     The KMS key of the replica that will be used for KMS  en-
                     cryption.

                 ProvisionedThroughputOverride -> (structure)
                     Replica-specific   provisioned  throughput.  If  not  de-

                     settings.

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        Replica-specific  read  capacity  units. If not speci-
                        fied, uses the source table's read capacity settings.

                 GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)

                        ProvisionedThroughputOverride -> (structure)
                            If not described, uses the source table GSI's read
                            capacity settings.

                            ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                               Replica-specific read capacity  units.  If  not
                               specified,  uses the source table's read capac-
                               ity settings.

                 ReplicaInaccessibleDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the replica was first detected as inac-
                     cessible. To determine cause of inaccessibility check the
                     ReplicaStatus property.

                 ReplicaTableClassSummary -> (structure)
                     Contains details of the table class.

              RestoreDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Point in time or source backup time.

              RestoreInProgress -> (boolean)
                 Indicates if a restore is in progress or not.

          SSEDescription -> (structure)
              The description of the  server-side  encryption  status  on  the
              specified table.

              Status -> (string)
                 Represents  the  current state of server-side encryption. The
                 only supported values are:

                 o ENABLED - Server-side encryption is enabled.

                 o UPDATING - Server-side encryption is being updated.

              SSEType -> (string)

              KMSMasterKeyArn -> (string)
                 The KMS key ARN used for the KMS encryption.

              InaccessibleEncryptionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Indicates the time, in UNIX epoch date format, when  DynamoDB
                 detected  that the table's KMS key was inaccessible. This at-
                 tribute will automatically be cleared when  DynamoDB  detects
                 that  the  table's KMS key is accessible again. DynamoDB will
                 initiate the table archival process when table's KMS key  re-
                 mains inaccessible for more than seven days from this date.

          ArchivalSummary -> (structure)
              Contains information about the table archive.

                 wish to restore this backup to the same table name, you  will
                 need to delete the original table.
