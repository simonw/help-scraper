UPDATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()                                    UPDATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()



NAME
       update-global-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or removes replicas in the specified global table. The global ta-
       ble must already exist to be able to use this operation. Any replica to
       be  added  must  be empty, have the same name as the global table, have
       the same key schema, have DynamoDB Streams enabled, and have  the  same
       provisioned and maximum write capacity units.

       NOTE:
          Although  you  can  use UpdateGlobalTable to add replicas and remove
          replicas in a single request, for simplicity we recommend  that  you
          issue separate requests for adding or removing replicas.

       If  global  secondary  indexes are specified, then the following condi-
       tions must also be met:

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same name.

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key
         (if present).

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same provisioned and maxi-
         mum write capacity units.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-global-table
          --global-table-name <value>
          --replica-updates <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The global table name.

       --replica-updates (list)
          A list of Regions that should be added or removed  from  the  global
          table.

          (structure)
              Represents one of the following:

              o A new replica to be added to an existing global table.

              o New parameters for an existing replica.

              o An  existing replica to be removed from an existing global ta-
                ble.

              Create -> (structure)
                 The parameters required for creating a replica on an existing
                 global table.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The Region of the replica to be added.

              Delete -> (structure)
                 The name of the existing replica to be removed.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The Region of the replica to be removed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Create={RegionName=string},Delete={RegionName=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Create": {
                "RegionName": "string"
              },
              "Delete": {
                "RegionName": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a DynamoDB global table

       The  following update-global-table example adds a replica in the speci-
       fied Region to the MusicCollection global table.

          aws dynamodb update-global-table \
              --global-table-name MusicCollection \
              --replica-updates Create={RegionName=eu-west-1}

       Output:

                  "ReplicationGroup": [
                      {
                          "RegionName": "eu-west-1"
                      },

OUTPUT
       GlobalTableDescription -> (structure)
          Contains the details of the global table.

          ReplicationGroup -> (list)
              The Regions where the global table has replicas.

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED  -  The replica is inaccessible because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for  more  than  20  hours,  DynamoDB will remove this
                        replica from the replication group. The  replica  will
                        not  be  deleted and replication will stop from and to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key  used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If  the  KMS key remains inaccessible for more than 20
                        hours, DynamoDB will  remove  this  replica  from  the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 ReplicaStatusDescription -> (string)
                     Detailed information about the replica status.

                 ReplicaStatusPercentProgress -> (string)
                     Specifies the progress of a Create, Update, or Delete ac-

                     The  KMS key of the replica that will be used for KMS en-
                     cryption.

                 ProvisionedThroughputOverride -> (structure)
                     Replica-specific  provisioned  throughput.  If  not   de-
                     scribed,  uses  the source table's provisioned throughput
                     settings.

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        Replica-specific read capacity units.  If  not  speci-
                        fied, uses the source table's read capacity settings.

                 GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
                     Replica-specific global secondary index settings.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  the  properties  of  a replica global sec-
                        ondary index.

                            ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                               Replica-specific  read  capacity  units. If not
                               specified, uses the source table's read  capac-
                               ity settings.

                 ReplicaInaccessibleDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time at which the replica was first detected as inac-
                     cessible. To determine cause of inaccessibility check the
