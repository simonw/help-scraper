UPDATE-ITEM()                                                    UPDATE-ITEM()



NAME
       update-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Edits an existing item's attributes, or adds a new item to the table if
       it does not already exist. You can put, delete, or add  attribute  val-
       ues. You can also perform a conditional update on an existing item (in-
       sert a new attribute name-value pair if it doesn't exist, or replace an
       existing name-value pair if it has certain expected attribute values).

       You  can also return the item's attribute values in the same UpdateItem
       operation using the ReturnValues parameter.

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table containing the item to update.  You  can  also
          provide  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parame-
          ter.

       --key (map)
          The primary key of the item to be updated. Each element consists  of
          an attribute name and a value for that attribute.

          For the primary key, you must provide all of the attributes. For ex-
          ample, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide  a  value
          for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide
          values for both the partition key and the sort key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For  more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

       --attribute-updates (map)
          This  is  a legacy parameter. Use UpdateExpression instead. For more

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              For  the  UpdateItem  operation, represents the attributes to be
              modified, the action to perform on each, and the new  value  for
              each.

              NOTE:
                 You  cannot  use  UpdateItem  to  update  any primary key at-
                 tributes. Instead, you will need to delete the item, and then
                 use PutItem to create a new item with new attributes.

              Attribute  values  cannot  be  null;  string and binary type at-
              tributes must have lengths greater than zero; and set  type  at-
              tributes  must  not be empty. Requests with empty values will be
              rejected with a ValidationException exception.

              Value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each attribute value is described as a name-value  pair.  The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                            (string)

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:
                        "NULL": true

                 BOOL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

              Action -> (string)
                 Specifies  how  to  perform  the update. Valid values are PUT
                 (default), DELETE , and ADD . The behavior depends on whether
                 the specified primary key already exists in the table.
                     If  an  item with the specified *Key* is found in the ta-
                     ble:

                 o PUT - Adds the specified attribute to the item. If the  at-
                   tribute already exists, it is replaced by the new value.

                 o DELETE  -  If  no value is specified, the attribute and its
                   value are removed from the item. The data type of the spec-
                   ified value must match the existing value's data type. If a
                   set of values is specified,  then  those  values  are  sub-
                   tracted  from  the  old  set. For example, if the attribute
                   value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE  action  specified
                   [a,c] , then the final attribute value would be [b] . Spec-
                   ifying an empty set is an error.

                 o ADD - If the attribute does not already exist, then the at-
                   tribute and its values are added to the item. If the attri-
                   bute does exist, then the behavior of ADD  depends  on  the
                   data type of the attribute:

                   o If  the  existing  attribute is a number, and if Value is
                     also a number, then the Value is mathematically added  to
                     the  existing  attribute.  If Value is a negative number,
                     then it is subtracted from the existing attribute.

                   NOTE:
                       If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number value
                       for  an  item that doesn't exist before the update, Dy-
                       namoDB uses 0 as the initial value. In addition, if you
                       use  ADD  to update an existing item, and intend to in-
                       crement or decrement an attribute value which does  not
                       yet  exist,  DynamoDB  uses 0 as the initial value. For
                       example, suppose that the item you want to update  does
                       not yet have an attribute named itemcount , but you de-
                       cide to ADD the number 3 to this attribute anyway, even
                       though  it currently does not exist. DynamoDB will cre-
                       ate the itemcount attribute, set its initial value to 0
                       ,  and  finally  add  3 to it. The result will be a new
                       itemcount attribute in the item, with a value of 3 .

                   o If the existing data type is a set, and if the  Value  is
                     also  a set, then the Value is added to the existing set.
                     (This is a set operation, not mathematical addition.) For
                     example,  if  the attribute value was the set [1,2] , and
                     the ADD action specified [3] , then the  final  attribute
                     value would be [1,2,3] . An error occurs if an Add action
                     is specified for a set attribute and the  attribute  type
                     specified  does  not  match  the existing set type.  Both
                     sets must have the same primitive data type. For example,
                     if  the existing data type is a set of strings, the Value
                     must also be a set of strings. The same  holds  true  for
                     number sets and binary sets.

                 This  action  is  only  valid for an existing attribute whose
                 data type is number or is a set. Do not use ADD for any other
                 data types.
                     If no item with the specified *Key* is found:

                 o PUT  -  DynamoDB creates a new item with the specified pri-
                   mary key, and then adds the attribute.

                 o DELETE - Nothing happens; there is no attribute to delete.

                 o ADD - DynamoDB creates a new item with the supplied primary
                   key  and  number (or set) for the attribute value. The only
                   data types allowed are number, number set,  string  set  or
                   binary set.

       --expected (map)
          This  is  a  legacy  parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
          more information, see Expected  in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB  Developer
          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents  a  condition to be compared with an attribute value.
              This condition can be used with DeleteItem , PutItem  ,  or  Up-
              dateItem  operations;  if  the comparison evaluates to true, the
              operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use Ex-
              pectedAttributeValue in one of two different ways:

              o Use  AttributeValueList  to specify one or more values to com-
                pare against an attribute. Use ComparisonOperator  to  specify
                how  you  want  to  perform  the comparison. If the comparison
                evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds.

              o Use Value to  specify  a  value  that  DynamoDB  will  compare
                against  an  attribute.  If the values match, then ExpectedAt-
                tributeValue evaluates to true and the  conditional  operation
                succeeds.  Optionally, you can also set Exists to false, indi-
                cating that you do not expect to find the attribute  value  in
                the  table.  In  this case, the conditional operation succeeds
                only if the comparison evaluates to false.
                 Value and Exists are incompatible with AttributeValueList and
                 ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use both sets of param-
                 eters at once, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException ex-
                 ception.

              Value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for the expected attribute.

                 Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair. The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 For more information, see Data Types in the  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                        "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                 SS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                        "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                     (string)

                 NS -> (list)

                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     (string)

                 BS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                        "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                     (blob)

                 M -> (map)

                        "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:
                        "NULL": true

                 BOOL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

              Exists -> (boolean)
                 Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the  value  before  attempting  a
                 conditional operation:

                 o If  Exists is true , DynamoDB will check to see if that at-
                   tribute value already exists in the table. If it is  found,
                   then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the opera-
                   tion fails with a ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 o If Exists is false , DynamoDB assumes  that  the  attribute
                   value  does  not  exist  in the table. If in fact the value
                   does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the opera-
                   tion  succeeds.  If the value is found, despite the assump-
                   tion that it does not exist, the  operation  fails  with  a
                   ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 The  default  setting  for  Exists  is true . If you supply a
                 Value all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the  attribute  exists:
                 You don't have to set Exists to true , because it is implied.

                 DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if:

                 o Exists  is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect
                   a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.)

                 o Exists is false but you also provide a Value . (You  cannot
                   expect  an  attribute to have a value, while also expecting
                   it not to exist.)

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A comparator for evaluating attributes in  the  AttributeVal-
                 ueList . For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ  | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data  types,  including
                   lists  and  maps.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue element  of  type  String,  Number,  Binary,
                   String  Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains
                   an AttributeValue element of a different type than the  one
                   provided  in the request, the value does not match. For ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing lists and maps.  AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  of type String, Number, Binary, String
                   Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an  At-
                   tributeValue  of  a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE : Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT : Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element  of  a
                   different  type  than  the one provided in the request, the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  con-
                   tain  only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  element of type String, Number, or Bi-
                   nary (not a set type). If an item  contains  an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This  operator  tests  for the existence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result is
                     a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute  "a
                     "  exists;  its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and  you  evaluate it using NULL , the result is a
                     Boolean false . This is because the attribute  "a  "  ex-
                     ists;  its data type is not relevant to the NULL compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or  value  in  a  set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the  target  attribute of the comparison is of type String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the  input.  If the target attribute of the comparison is a
                   set ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates
                   to  true  if it finds an exact match with any member of the
                   set. CONTAINS is supported for lists:  When  evaluating  "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or  ab-
                   sence  of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not  a  set  type). If the target attribute of the
                   comparison is a String, then the operator  checks  for  the
                   absence  of  a  substring match. If the target attribute of
                   the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for  the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put. If the target attribute of the  comparison  is  a  set
                   ("SS  ",  "NS  ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates to
                   true if it does not find an exact match with any member  of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b  "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain only one AttributeValue of type  String  or  Binary
                   (not  a  Number or a set type). The target attribute of the
                   comparison must be of type String or Binary (not  a  Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList can contain one or more AttributeValue  elements  of
                   type  String,  Number, or Binary. These attributes are com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to  the  first  value,  and
                   less  than  or  equal  to the second value.   AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type,  either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A
                   target attribute matches if the  target  value  is  greater
                   than,  or  equal  to,  the  first element and less than, or
                   equal to, the second element. If an item  contains  an  At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  . Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One or more values to evaluate against  the  supplied  attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String value comparisons for greater than,  equals,  or  less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is greater than A , and a is greater than B . For a  list  of
                 code                        values,                       see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For  Binary,  DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 Data Format in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                            "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

                            N -> (string)
                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                            NULL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Null. For example:
                                   "NULL": true

                            BOOL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                                   "BOOL": true

                     L -> (list)
                        An attribute of type List. For example:
                            "L":  [  {"S": "Cookies"} , {"S": "Coffee"}, {"N":

                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                                   "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                               An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                                   "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                               (string)

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB

       --conditional-operator (string)
          This  is  a  legacy  parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
          more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
          veloper Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --return-values (string)
          Use  ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they ap-
          pear before or after they are successfully updated. For UpdateItem ,
          the valid values are:

          o NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE ,
            then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return-
            Values .)

          o ALL_OLD  -  Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they ap-
            peared before the UpdateItem operation.

          o UPDATED_OLD - Returns only the updated  attributes,  as  they  ap-
            peared before the UpdateItem operation.

          o ALL_NEW  -  Returns all of the attributes of the item, as they ap-
            pear after the UpdateItem operation.

          o UPDATED_NEW - Returns only the updated attributes, as they  appear
            after the UpdateItem operation.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          The values returned are strongly consistent.

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ALL_OLD

          o UPDATED_OLD

          o ALL_NEW

          o UPDATED_NEW

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the  operation,  together with ConsumedCapacity for each table and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return  ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL  - The response includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --return-item-collection-metrics (string)
          Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If  set  to
          SIZE  ,  the response includes statistics about item collections, if
          any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the re-
          sponse. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SIZE

          o NONE

       --update-expression (string)
          An expression that defines one or more attributes to be updated, the
          action to be performed on them, and new values for them.

          The following action values are available for UpdateExpression .

          o SET - Adds one or more attributes and values to an item. If any of
            these  attributes already exist, they are replaced by the new val-
            ues. You can also use SET to add or  subtract  from  an  attribute
            that  is  of  type  Number.  For example: SET myNum = myNum + :val
            SET supports the following functions:

            o if_not_exists (path, operand) - if the item does not contain  an
              attribute at the specified path, then if_not_exists evaluates to
              operand; otherwise, it evaluates to path. You can use this func-
              tion  to  avoid  overwriting  an  attribute  that may already be
              present in the item.

            o list_append (operand, operand) - evaluates to a list with a  new
              element added to it. You can append the new element to the start
              or the end of the list by reversing the order of the operands.

          These function names are case-sensitive.

          o REMOVE - Removes one or more attributes from an item.

          o ADD - Adds the specified value to the item, if the attribute  does
            not  already exist. If the attribute does exist, then the behavior
            of ADD depends on the data type of the attribute:

            o If the existing attribute is a number, and if Value  is  also  a
              number,  then  Value is mathematically added to the existing at-
              tribute. If Value is a negative number, then  it  is  subtracted
              from the existing attribute.

            NOTE:
                If you use ADD to increment or decrement a number value for an
                item that doesn't exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0  as
                the  initial  value. Similarly, if you use ADD for an existing
                item to increment or decrement an attribute value that doesn't
                exist before the update, DynamoDB uses 0 as the initial value.
                For example, suppose that the item you want to update  doesn't
                have  an attribute named itemcount , but you decide to ADD the
                number 3 to this attribute anyway. DynamoDB  will  create  the
                itemcount  attribute, set its initial value to 0 , and finally
                add 3 to it. The result will be a new itemcount  attribute  in
                the item, with a value of 3 .

            o If  the  existing data type is a set and if Value is also a set,
              then Value is added to the existing set. For example, if the at-
              tribute  value  is  the set [1,2] , and the ADD action specified
              [3] , then the final attribute value is [1,2,3] . An  error  oc-
              curs  if  an ADD action is specified for a set attribute and the
              attribute type specified does not match the existing  set  type.
              Both  sets  must have the same primitive data type. For example,
              if the existing data type is a set of strings,  the  Value  must
              also be a set of strings.

          WARNING:
              The ADD action only supports Number and set data types. In addi-
              tion, ADD can only be used on top-level attributes,  not  nested
              attributes.

          o DELETE  -  Deletes  an  element  from a set. If a set of values is
            specified, then those values are subtracted from the old set.  For
            example, if the attribute value was the set [a,b,c] and the DELETE
            action specifies [a,c] , then the final attribute value is  [b]  .
            Specifying an empty set is an error.

          WARNING:
              The  DELETE  action  only  supports set data types. In addition,
              DELETE can only be used on top-level attributes, not nested  at-
              tributes.

          You  can  have many actions in a single expression, such as the fol-
          lowing: SET a=:value1, b=:value2 DELETE :value3, :value4, :value5

          For more information on update expressions, see Modifying Items  and
          Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --condition-expression (string)
          A condition that must be satisfied in order for a conditional update
          to succeed.

          An expression can contain any of the following:

          o Functions:  attribute_exists  |  attribute_not_exists   |   attri-
            bute_type  |  contains | begins_with | size   These function names
            are case-sensitive.

          o Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN

          o Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT

          For more information about  condition  expressions,  see  Specifying
          Conditions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --expression-attribute-names (map)
          One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in an expres-
          sion. The following are  some  use  cases  for  using  ExpressionAt-
          tributeNames :

          o To  access  an  attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB re-
            served word.

          o To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an  attribute
            name in an expression.

          o To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being mis-
            interpreted in an expression.

          Use the # character in an expression  to  dereference  an  attribute
          name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

          o Percentile

          The  name  of  this  attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
          cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list  of
          reserved  words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide .) To work around this, you could specify  the  following  for
          ExpressionAttributeNames :

          o {"#P":"Percentile"}

          You  could  then  use this substitution in an expression, as in this
          example:

          o #P = :val

          NOTE:
              Tokens that begin with the : character are expression  attribute
              values , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

          For   more   information   about  expression  attribute  names,  see
          Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expression-attribute-values (map)
          One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

          Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference  an  at-
          tribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
          the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:
              Available | Backordered | Discontinued

          You would first need to specify  ExpressionAttributeValues  as  fol-
          lows:
              {    ":avail":{"S":"Available"},    ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
              ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }

          You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
              ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)

          For more information on expression attribute values,  see  Condition
          Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

       --return-values-on-condition-check-failure (string)
          An optional parameter that returns the item attributes  for  an  Up-
          dateItem operation that failed a condition check.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_OLD

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's

       Example 1: To update an item in a table

       The  following  update-item example updates an item in the MusicCollec-
       tion table. It adds a new attribute (Year) and modifies the  AlbumTitle
       attribute.  All of the attributes in the item, as they appear after the
       update, are returned in the response.

          aws dynamodb update-item \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --key file://key.json \
              --update-expression "SET #Y = :y, #AT = :t" \
              --expression-attribute-names file://expression-attribute-names.json \
              --expression-attribute-values file://expression-attribute-values.json  \

       Example 2: To update an item conditionally

       The following example updates an item in the MusicCollection table, but
       only if the existing item does not already have a Year attribute.

          aws dynamodb update-item \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --key file://key.json \
              --update-expression "SET #Y = :y, #AT = :t" \
              --expression-attribute-names file://expression-attribute-names.json \
              --expression-attribute-values file://expression-attribute-values.json  \
              --condition-expression "attribute_not_exists(#Y)"

       Contents of key.json:

          {
              "Artist": {"S": "Acme Band"},
              "SongTitle": {"S": "Happy Day"}
          }

       Contents of expression-attribute-names.json:

          {
              "#Y":"Year",
              "#AT":"AlbumTitle"
          }

       Contents of expression-attribute-values.json:

          {
              ":y":{"N": "2015"},
              ":t":{"S": "Louder Than Ever"}
          }

       If the item already has a Year attribute, DynamoDB returns the  follow-
       ing output.

          An error occurred (ConditionalCheckFailedException) when calling the UpdateItem operation: The conditional request failed

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (map)
          A map of attribute values as they appear before  or  after  the  Up-
          dateItem operation, as determined by the ReturnValues parameter.

          The  Attributes map is only present if the update was successful and
          ReturnValues was specified as something other than NONE in  the  re-
          quest. Each element represents one attribute.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                 CapacityUnits -> (double)
                     The total number of capacity units consumed on a table or
                     an index.

          GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (map)
              The amount of throughput consumed on each global index  affected
              by the operation.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the amount of provisioned throughput capacity con-
                 sumed on a table or an index.

                 ReadCapacityUnits -> (double)
                     The total number of read capacity units consumed on a ta-
                     ble or an index.

                 WriteCapacityUnits -> (double)
                     The  total  number  of write capacity units consumed on a
                     table or an index.

                 CapacityUnits -> (double)
                     The total number of capacity units consumed on a table or
                     an index.

       ItemCollectionMetrics -> (structure)
          Information  about  item  collections, if any, that were affected by
          the UpdateItem operation. ItemCollectionMetrics is only returned  if
          the  ReturnItemCollectionMetrics parameter was specified. If the ta-
          ble does not have any local secondary indexes, this  information  is
          not returned in the response.

          Each ItemCollectionMetrics element consists of:

          o ItemCollectionKey  -  The  partition key value of the item collec-
            tion. This is the same as the partition key value of the item  it-
            self.

          o SizeEstimateRangeGB  - An estimate of item collection size, in gi-
            gabytes. This value is a  two-element  array  containing  a  lower
            bound  and  an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes
            the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of  all  at-
            tributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on that
            table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary  in-
            dex  is  approaching  its  size  limit. The estimate is subject to
            change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accu-
            racy of the estimate.

          ItemCollectionKey -> (map)
              The  partition  key  value of the item collection. This value is
              the same as the partition key value of the item.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each attribute value is described as a name-value  pair.  The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     (string)

                 BS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:

                 M -> (map)
                     An attribute of type Map. For example:
                        "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

          SizeEstimateRangeGB -> (list)
              An estimate of item collection size, in gigabytes. This value is
              a two-element array containing a lower bound and an upper  bound

              items in the table, plus the size of  all  attributes  projected
              into  all of the local secondary indexes on that table. Use this
              estimate to measure whether a local secondary index is approach-
              ing its size limit.

              The  estimate  is subject to change over time; therefore, do not
              rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
