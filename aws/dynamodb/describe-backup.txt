NAME
       describe-backup -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an existing backup of a table.

       You can call DescribeBackup at a maximum rate of 10 times per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-backup
          --backup-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) associated with the backup.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       BackupDescription -> (structure)
          Contains the description of the backup created for the table.

          BackupDetails -> (structure)
              Contains the details of the backup created for the table.

              BackupArn -> (string)
                 ARN associated with the backup.

              BackupName -> (string)
                 Name of the requested backup.

              BackupSizeBytes -> (long)
                 Size  of the backup in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value ap-
                 proximately every six hours. Recent changes might not be  re-
                 flected in this value.

              BackupStatus -> (string)
                 Backup  can  be in one of the following states: CREATING, AC-
                 TIVE, DELETED.

              BackupType -> (string)
                 BackupType:

                 o USER - You create and  manage  these  using  the  on-demand
                   backup feature.

                 o SYSTEM  - If you delete a table with point-in-time recovery
                   enabled, a SYSTEM backup is automatically  created  and  is
                   retained  for 35 days (at no additional cost). System back-
                   ups allow you to restore the deleted table to the state  it
                   was in just before the point of deletion.

                 o AWS_BACKUP  -  On-demand  backup created by you from Backup
                   service.

              BackupCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time at which the backup was created.  This  is  the  request
                 time of the backup.

              BackupExpiryDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time  at  which the automatic on-demand backup created by Dy-
                 namoDB will expire. This SYSTEM on-demand backup expires  au-
                 tomatically 35 days after its creation.

          SourceTableDetails -> (structure)
              Contains the details of the table when the backup was created.

              TableName -> (string)
                 The name of the table for which the backup was created.

              TableId -> (string)
                 Unique identifier for the table for which the backup was cre-
                 ated.

              TableArn -> (string)
                 ARN of the table for which backup was created.

              TableSizeBytes -> (long)
                 Size of the table in bytes. Note that this is an  approximate
                 value.

              KeySchema -> (list)
                 Schema of the table.

                 (structure)
                     Represents a single element of a key schema. A key schema
                     specifies the attributes that make up the primary key  of
                     a table, or the key attributes of an index.

                     A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of
                     the primary key. For example, a simple primary key  would
                     be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition
                     key).  A  composite  primary  key   would   require   one
                     KeySchemaElement  for  the  partition  key,  and  another
                     KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                     A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attribute
                     (not  a  nested  attribute). The data type must be one of
                     String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be nested
                     within a List or a Map.

                     AttributeName -> (string)
                        The name of a key attribute.

                     KeyType -> (string)
                        The role that this key attribute will assume:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The  partition key of an item is also known as its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"  derives
                            from  the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

              TableCreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Time when the source table was created.

              ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                 Read  IOPs  and  Write  IOPS on the table when the backup was
                 created.

                 ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum number of strongly consistent reads  consumed
                     per  second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException
                     . For more information, see Specifying Read and Write Re-
                     quirements in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value
                     is set to 0.

                 WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                     The maximum number of writes consumed per  second  before
                     DynamoDB  returns a ThrottlingException . For more infor-
                     mation, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value
                     is set to 0.

              ItemCount -> (long)
                 Number of items in the table. Note that this is  an  approxi-
                 mate value.

              BillingMode -> (string)
                 Controls  how  you  are charged for read and write throughput
                 and how you manage capacity.  This  setting  can  be  changed
                 later.

                 o PROVISIONED  -  Sets the read/write capacity mode to PROVI-
                   SIONED . We recommend  using  PROVISIONED  for  predictable
                   workloads.

                 o PAY_PER_REQUEST  -  Sets  the  read/write  capacity mode to
                   PAY_PER_REQUEST . We recommend  using  PAY_PER_REQUEST  for
                   unpredictable workloads.

          SourceTableFeatureDetails -> (structure)
              Contains  the  details of the features enabled on the table when
              the backup was created. For example, LSIs, GSIs, streams, TTL.

              LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
                 Represents the LSI properties for the table when  the  backup
                 was created. It includes the IndexName, KeySchema and Projec-
                 tion for the LSIs on the table at the time of backup.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the properties of a local secondary index  for
                     the table when the backup was created.

                     IndexName -> (string)
                        Represents the name of the local secondary index.

                     KeySchema -> (list)
                        The  complete  key schema for a local secondary index,
                        which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names
                        and key types:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The  partition key of an item is also known as its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"  derives
                            from  the  way DynamoDB stores items with the same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

                        (structure)
                            Represents a single element of a key schema. A key
                            schema specifies the attributes that make  up  the
                            primary  key  of a table, or the key attributes of
                            an index.

                            A KeySchemaElement represents exactly  one  attri-
                            bute  of  the  primary  key. For example, a simple
                            primary  key   would   be   represented   by   one
                            KeySchemaElement  (for  the partition key). A com-
                            posite primary key would require one KeySchemaEle-
                            ment   for   the   partition   key,   and  another
                            KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                            A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level at-
                            tribute  (not  a  nested attribute). The data type
                            must be one of String, Number, or Binary. The  at-
                            tribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

                            AttributeName -> (string)
                               The name of a key attribute.

                            KeyType -> (string)
                               The role that this key attribute will assume:

                               o HASH - partition key

                               o RANGE - sort key

                               NOTE:
                                   The  partition key of an item is also known
                                   as its hash attribute . The term "hash  at-
                                   tribute"  derives  from DynamoDB's usage of
                                   an internal hash function  to  evenly  dis-
                                   tribute data items across partitions, based
                                   on their partition key values.

                                   The sort key of an item is  also  known  as
                                   its  range  attribute . The term "range at-
                                   tribute"  derives  from  the  way  DynamoDB
                                   stores  items  with  the same partition key
                                   physically close together, in sorted  order
                                   by the sort key value.

                     Projection -> (structure)
                        Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from
                        the table into the global secondary index.  These  are
                        in  addition  to  the primary key attributes and index
                        key attributes, which are automatically projected.

                        ProjectionType -> (string)
                            The set of attributes that are projected into  the
                            index:

                            o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are
                              projected into the index.

                            o INCLUDE - In  addition  to  the  attributes  de-
                              scribed  in KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will
                              include other non-key attributes that you  spec-
                              ify.

                            o ALL  - All of the table attributes are projected
                              into the index.

                        NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                            Represents the non-key attribute names which  will
                            be projected into the index.

                            For  local  secondary  indexes, the total count of
                            NonKeyAttributes summed across all  of  the  local
                            secondary  indexes,  must  not  exceed 100. If you
                            project the same attribute into two different  in-
                            dexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when
                            determining the total.

                            (string)

              GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
                 Represents the GSI properties for the table when  the  backup
                 was  created.  It  includes the IndexName, KeySchema, Projec-
                 tion, and ProvisionedThroughput for the GSIs on the table  at
                 the time of backup.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the properties of a global secondary index for
                     the table when the backup was created.

                     IndexName -> (string)
                        The name of the global secondary index.

                     KeySchema -> (list)
                        The complete key schema for a global secondary  index,
                        which consists of one or more pairs of attribute names
                        and key types:

                        o HASH - partition key

                        o RANGE - sort key

                        NOTE:
                            The partition key of an item is also known as  its
                            hash attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives
                            from DynamoDB's usage of an internal hash function
                            to evenly distribute data items across partitions,
                            based on their partition key values.

                            The sort key of an item is also known as its range
                            attribute  .  The  term  "range attribute" derives
                            from the way DynamoDB stores items with  the  same
                            partition key physically close together, in sorted
                            order by the sort key value.

                        (structure)
                            Represents a single element of a key schema. A key
                            schema  specifies  the attributes that make up the
                            primary key of a table, or the key  attributes  of
                            an index.

                            A  KeySchemaElement  represents exactly one attri-
                            bute of the primary key.  For  example,  a  simple
                            primary   key   would   be   represented   by  one
                            KeySchemaElement (for the partition key).  A  com-
                            posite primary key would require one KeySchemaEle-
                            ment  for   the   partition   key,   and   another
                            KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                            A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level at-
                            tribute (not a nested attribute).  The  data  type
                            must  be one of String, Number, or Binary. The at-
                            tribute cannot be nested within a List or a Map.

                            AttributeName -> (string)
                               The name of a key attribute.

                            KeyType -> (string)
                               The role that this key attribute will assume:

                               o HASH - partition key

                               o RANGE - sort key

                               NOTE:
                                   The partition key of an item is also  known
                                   as  its hash attribute . The term "hash at-
                                   tribute" derives from DynamoDB's  usage  of
                                   an  internal  hash  function to evenly dis-
                                   tribute data items across partitions, based
                                   on their partition key values.

                                   The  sort  key  of an item is also known as
                                   its range attribute . The term  "range  at-
                                   tribute"  derives  from  the  way  DynamoDB
                                   stores items with the  same  partition  key
                                   physically  close together, in sorted order
                                   by the sort key value.

                     Projection -> (structure)
                        Represents attributes that are copied (projected) from
                        the  table  into the global secondary index. These are
                        in addition to the primary key  attributes  and  index
                        key attributes, which are automatically projected.

                        ProjectionType -> (string)
                            The  set of attributes that are projected into the
                            index:

                            o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys  are
                              projected into the index.

                            o INCLUDE  -  In  addition  to  the attributes de-
                              scribed in KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index  will
                              include  other non-key attributes that you spec-
                              ify.

                            o ALL - All of the table attributes are  projected
                              into the index.

                        NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                            Represents  the non-key attribute names which will
                            be projected into the index.

                            For local secondary indexes, the  total  count  of
                            NonKeyAttributes  summed  across  all of the local
                            secondary indexes, must not  exceed  100.  If  you
                            project  the same attribute into two different in-
                            dexes, this counts as two distinct attributes when
                            determining the total.

                            (string)

                     ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                        Represents the provisioned throughput settings for the
                        specified global secondary index.

                        ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                            The maximum number of  strongly  consistent  reads
                            consumed  per  second  before  DynamoDB  returns a
                            ThrottlingException . For  more  information,  see
                            Specifying Read and Write Requirements in the Ama-
                            zon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                            If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the
                            value is set to 0.

                        WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                            The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second
                            before DynamoDB returns  a  ThrottlingException  .

                            If read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the
                            value is set to 0.

              StreamDescription -> (structure)
                 Stream settings on the table when the backup was created.

                 StreamEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled  (true)  or
                     disabled (false) on the table.

                 StreamViewType -> (string)
                     When an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType de-
                     termines what information is written to  the  stream  for
                     this table. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

                     o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only  the  key attributes of the modified
                       item are written to the stream.

                     o NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appears after it was
                       modified, is written to the stream.

                     o OLD_IMAGE  -  The entire item, as it appeared before it
                       was modified, is written to the stream.

                     o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old item  im-
                       ages of the item are written to the stream.

              TimeToLiveDescription -> (structure)
                 Time  to  Live settings on the table when the backup was cre-
                 ated.

                 TimeToLiveStatus -> (string)
                     The TTL status for the table.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of the TTL attribute for items in the table.

              SSEDescription -> (structure)
                 The description of the server-side encryption status  on  the
                 table when the backup was created.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Represents  the  current state of server-side encryption.
                     The only supported values are:

                     o ENABLED - Server-side encryption is enabled.

                     o UPDATING - Server-side encryption is being updated.

                 SSEType -> (string)
                     Server-side encryption type. The only supported value is:

                     o KMS - Server-side encryption that uses  Key  Management
                       Service.  The key is stored in your account and is man-
                       aged by KMS (KMS charges apply).

                 KMSMasterKeyArn -> (string)
                     The KMS key ARN used for the KMS encryption.

                 InaccessibleEncryptionDateTime -> (timestamp)
                     Indicates the time, in UNIX epoch date format,  when  Dy-
                     namoDB  detected  that the table's KMS key was inaccessi-
                     ble. This attribute will automatically  be  cleared  when
                     DynamoDB  detects  that the table's KMS key is accessible
                     again. DynamoDB will initiate the table archival  process
                     when  table's  KMS key remains inaccessible for more than
                     seven days from this date.
