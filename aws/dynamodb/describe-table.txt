DESCRIBE-TABLE()                                              DESCRIBE-TABLE()



NAME
       describe-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the table, including the current status of
       the table, when it was created, the primary key schema, and any indexes
       on the table.

       NOTE:
          If you issue a DescribeTable request immediately after a CreateTable
          request, DynamoDB might return a ResourceNotFoundException . This is
          because  DescribeTable  uses an eventually consistent query, and the
          metadata for your table might not be available at that moment.  Wait
          for a few seconds, and then try the DescribeTable request again.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-table
          --table-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]
          [--debug]
          [--endpoint-url <value>]
          [--no-verify-ssl]
          [--no-paginate]
          [--output <value>]
          [--query <value>]
          [--profile <value>]
          [--region <value>]
          [--version <value>]
          [--color <value>]
          [--no-sign-request]

          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Table -> (structure)
          The properties of the table.

          AttributeDefinitions -> (list)
              An  array  of AttributeDefinition objects. Each of these objects
              describes one attribute in the table and index key schema.

              Each AttributeDefinition object in this array is composed of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o AttributeType - The data type for the attribute.

              (structure)
                 Represents an attribute for describing the key schema for the
                 table and indexes.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     A name for the attribute.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type for the attribute, where:

                     o S - the attribute is of type String

                     o N - the attribute is of type Number

                     o B - the attribute is of type Binary

          TableName -> (string)
              The name of the table.

          KeySchema -> (list)
              The  primary  key structure for the table. Each KeySchemaElement
              consists of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o KeyType - The role of the attribute:

                o HASH - partition key

                o RANGE - sort key

              NOTE:
                 The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attri-
                 bute  . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's us-
                 age of an internal hash function to  evenly  distribute  data
                 items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                 The  sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute
                 . The term "range attribute" derives from  the  way  DynamoDB
                 stores items with the same partition key physically close to-
                 gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in  the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              (structure)
                 Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key schema
                 specifies the attributes that make up the primary  key  of  a
                 table, or the key attributes of an index.

                 A  KeySchemaElement  represents  exactly one attribute of the
                 primary key. For example, a simple primary key would be  rep-
                 resented  by  one KeySchemaElement (for the partition key). A
                 composite primary key would require one KeySchemaElement  for
                 the  partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the sort
                 key.

                 A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not
                 a  nested  attribute).  The  data type must be one of String,
                 Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot be  nested  within  a
                 List or a Map.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of a key attribute.

                 KeyType -> (string)
                     The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's  usage of an internal hash function to evenly
                        distribute data  items  across  partitions,  based  on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute . The term "range attribute" derives from  the
                        way  DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

          TableStatus -> (string)
              The current state of the table:

              o CREATING - The table is being created.

              o UPDATING - The table is being updated.

              o DELETING - The table is being deleted.

              o ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

              o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used to en-
                crypt the table in inaccessible. Table operations may fail due
                to  failure to use the KMS key. DynamoDB will initiate the ta-
                ble archival process when a table's KMS key remains inaccessi-
                ble for more than seven days.

              o ARCHIVING  -  The  table is being archived. Operations are not
                allowed until archival is complete.

              o ARCHIVED - The table has been archived. See the ArchivalReason
                for more information.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the table was created, in UNIX epoch time
              format.

          ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
              The provisioned throughput settings for the table, consisting of
              read  and  write capacity units, along with data about increases
              and decreases.

              LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase
                 for this table.

              LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease
                 for this table.

              NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                 The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table
                 during  this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on provi-
                 sioned throughput decreases, see Service, Account, and  Table
                 Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The  maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed per
                 second before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .  Even-
                 tually  consistent  reads  require  less effort than strongly
                 consistent reads, so a setting of  50  ReadCapacityUnits  per
                 second  provides  100 eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits
                 per second.

              WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The maximum number of writes consumed per second  before  Dy-
                 namoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

          TableSizeBytes -> (long)
              The  total  size  of the specified table, in bytes. DynamoDB up-
              dates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent  changes
              might not be reflected in this value.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The  number  of  items  in the specified table. DynamoDB updates
              this value approximately every six hours. Recent  changes  might
              not be reflected in this value.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the ta-
              ble.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique identifier for the table for which the  backup  was  cre-
              ated.

          BillingModeSummary -> (structure)
              Contains the details for the read/write capacity mode.

              BillingMode -> (string)
                 Controls  how  you  are charged for read and write throughput
                 and how you manage capacity.  This  setting  can  be  changed
                 later.

                 o PROVISIONED  -  Sets the read/write capacity mode to PROVI-
                   SIONED . We recommend  using  PROVISIONED  for  predictable
                   workloads.

                 o PAY_PER_REQUEST  -  Sets  the  read/write  capacity mode to
                   PAY_PER_REQUEST . We recommend  using  PAY_PER_REQUEST  for
                   unpredictable workloads.

              LastUpdateToPayPerRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Represents  the time when PAY_PER_REQUEST was last set as the
                 read/write capacity mode.

          LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              Represents one or more local secondary  indexes  on  the  table.
              Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. Tables with
              one or more local secondary indexes are subject to an item  col-
              lection size limit, where the amount of data within a given item
              collection cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:

              o IndexName - The name of the local secondary index.

              o KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema.  The  at-
                tribute  names  in  the  key  schema must be between 1 and 255
                characters (inclusive). The key schema  must  begin  with  the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection  - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
                from the table into the index. These are in  addition  to  the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically projected. Each attribute  specification  is  com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE - Only the specified  table  attributes  are  pro-
                    jected into the index. The list of projected attributes is
                    in NonKeyAttributes .

                  o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected  into  the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes  -  A list of one or more non-key attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count  of  attributes  provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you  project  the same attribute into two different indexes,
                  this counts as two distinct attributes when determining  the
                  total.

              o IndexSizeBytes  -  Represents  the total size of the index, in
                bytes. DynamoDB updates this  value  approximately  every  six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o ItemCount  -  Represents the number of items in the index. Dy-
                namoDB updates this value approximately every six  hours.  Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              If  the table is in the DELETING state, no information about in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     Represents the name of the local secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The complete key schema for the  local  secondary  index,
                     consisting  of  one  or more pairs of attribute names and
                     key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a single element of a  key  schema.  A  key
                        schema  specifies the attributes that make up the pri-
                        mary key of a table, or the key attributes of  an  in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the primary key. For example,  a  simple  primary  key
                        would  be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the
                        partition key). A composite primary key would  require
                        one  KeySchemaElement  for  the partition key, and an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attri-
                        bute  (not  a nested attribute). The data type must be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The  partition  key of an item is also known as
                               its hash attribute . The term "hash  attribute"
                               derives  from  DynamoDB's  usage of an internal
                               hash function to evenly distribute  data  items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The sort key of an item is also  known  as  its
                               range  attribute  .  The term "range attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the  same  partition  key  physically close to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents attributes that are  copied  (projected)  from
                     the  table  into the global secondary index. These are in
                     addition to the primary key attributes and index key  at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The  set of attributes that are projected into the in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will  include  other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents the non-key attribute names which  will  be
                        projected into the index.

                        For  local  secondary indexes, the total count of Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes,  must not exceed 100. If you project the same
                        attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The  number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB up-
                     dates this value approximately every  six  hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies
                     the index.

          GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              The global secondary indexes, if any, on the table.  Each  index
              is  scoped  to a given partition key value. Each element is com-
              posed of:

              o Backfilling - If true, then the  index  is  currently  in  the
                backfilling  phase.  Backfilling occurs only when a new global
                secondary index is added to the table. It is  the  process  by
                which  DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the ta-
                ble. (This attribute does not appear  for  indexes  that  were
                created  during  a  CreateTable operation.)  You can delete an
                index that is being created during the Backfilling phase  when
                IndexStatus  is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is true. You
                can't delete the index that is being created when  IndexStatus
                is  set  to CREATING and Backfilling is false. (This attribute
                does not appear for indexes that were created  during  a  Cre-
                ateTable operation.)

              o IndexName - The name of the global secondary index.

              o IndexSizeBytes - The total size of the global secondary index,
                in bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every  six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o IndexStatus  -  The current status of the global secondary in-
                dex:

                o CREATING - The index is being created.

                o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

              o ItemCount - The number of items in the global secondary index.
                DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o KeySchema - Specifies the complete index key schema.  The  at-
                tribute  names  in  the  key  schema must be between 1 and 255
                characters (inclusive). The key schema  must  begin  with  the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection  - Specifies attributes that are copied (projected)
                from the table into the index. These are in  addition  to  the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically projected. Each attribute  specification  is  com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY  - Only the index and primary keys are projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE - In  addition  to  the  attributes  described  in
                    KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will include other non-key
                    attributes that you specify.

                  o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected  into  the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes  -  A list of one or more non-key attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count  of  attributes  provided in NonKeyAttributes , summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you  project  the same attribute into two different indexes,
                  this counts as two distinct attributes when determining  the
                  total.

              o ProvisionedThroughput  -  The  provisioned throughput settings
                for the global secondary index, consisting of read  and  write
                capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.

              If  the table is in the DELETING state, no information about in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The complete key schema for  a  global  secondary  index,
                     which  consists  of  one or more pairs of attribute names
                     and key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents a single element of a  key  schema.  A  key
                        schema  specifies the attributes that make up the pri-
                        mary key of a table, or the key attributes of  an  in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the primary key. For example,  a  simple  primary  key
                        would  be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for the
                        partition key). A composite primary key would  require
                        one  KeySchemaElement  for  the partition key, and an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level  attri-
                        bute  (not  a nested attribute). The data type must be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The  partition  key of an item is also known as
                               its hash attribute . The term "hash  attribute"
                               derives  from  DynamoDB's  usage of an internal
                               hash function to evenly distribute  data  items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The sort key of an item is also  known  as  its
                               range  attribute  .  The term "range attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the  same  partition  key  physically close to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents attributes that are  copied  (projected)  from
                     the  table  into the global secondary index. These are in
                     addition to the primary key attributes and index key  at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The  set of attributes that are projected into the in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will  include  other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents the non-key attribute names which  will  be
                        projected into the index.

                        For  local  secondary indexes, the total count of Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes,  must not exceed 100. If you project the same
                        attribute into two different indexes, this  counts  as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the global secondary index:

                     o CREATING - The index is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

                 Backfilling -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  the  index  is currently backfilling.
                     Backfilling is the process of reading items from the  ta-
                     ble  and determining whether they can be added to the in-
                     dex. (Not all items will qualify: For example,  a  parti-
                     tion  key  cannot  have any duplicate values.) If an item
                     can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all
                     items  have  been processed, the backfilling operation is
                     complete and Backfilling is false.

                     You can delete an index that is being created during  the
                     Backfilling phase when IndexStatus is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling is true. You can't delete the index  that  is
                     being  created  when  IndexStatus  is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling is false.

                     NOTE:
                        For indexes that were created during a CreateTable op-
                        eration,  the Backfilling attribute does not appear in
                        the DescribeTable output.

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents the provisioned throughput  settings  for  the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For  current  minimum  and maximum provisioned throughput
                     values, see Service, Account, and  Table  Quotas  in  the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time of the last provisioned throughput
                        increase for this table.

                     LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time of the last  provisioned  throughput
                        decrease for this table.

                     NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                        The  number  of  provisioned  throughput decreases for
                        this table during this UTC calendar day.  For  current
                        maximums  on  provisioned  throughput  decreases,  see
                        Service, Account, and Table Quotas in the  Amazon  Dy-
                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of strongly consistent reads con-
                        sumed per second  before  DynamoDB  returns  a  Throt-
                        tlingException  .  Eventually consistent reads require
                        less effort than strongly consistent reads, so a  set-
                        ting  of  50 ReadCapacityUnits per second provides 100
                        eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The maximum number of writes consumed per  second  be-
                        fore DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates this value approximately every six hours.  Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The  number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB up-
                     dates this value approximately every  six  hours.  Recent

                 abled (false) on the table.

              StreamViewType -> (string)
                 When  an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType deter-
                 mines what information is written to the stream for this  ta-
                 ble. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

                 o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only  the key attributes of the modified item
                   are written to the stream.

                 o NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it  appears  after  it  was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o OLD_IMAGE  -  The entire item, as it appeared before it was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old  item  images
                   of the item are written to the stream.

          LatestStreamLabel -> (string)
              A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

              Note  that  LatestStreamLabel is not a unique identifier for the
              stream, because it is possible that a stream from another  table
              might  have  the same timestamp. However, the combination of the
              following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

              o Amazon Web Services customer ID

              o Table name

              o StreamLabel

          LatestStreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the lat-
              est stream for this table.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED - The replica is  inaccessible  because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for more than 20  hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this
                        replica  from  the replication group. The replica will
                        not be deleted and replication will stop from  and  to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS  - The KMS key used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If the KMS key remains inaccessible for more  than  20
                        hours,  DynamoDB  will  remove  this  replica from the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.
