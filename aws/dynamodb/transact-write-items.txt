TRANSACT-WRITE-ITEMS()                                  TRANSACT-WRITE-ITEMS()



NAME
       transact-write-items -

DESCRIPTION
          TransactWriteItems  is  a synchronous write operation that groups up
          to 25 action requests. These actions can target items  in  different
          tables,  but  not  in  different Amazon Web Services accounts or Re-
          gions, and no two actions can target the same item. For example, you
          cannot  both  ConditionCheck and Update the same item. The aggregate
          size of the items in the transaction cannot exceed 4 MB.

       The actions are completed atomically so that either all  of  them  suc-
       ceed, or all of them fail. They are defined by the following objects:

       o Put   Initiates  a PutItem operation to write a new item. This struc-
         ture specifies the primary key of the item to be written, the name of
         the  table to write it in, an optional condition expression that must
         be satisfied for the write to succeed,  a  list  of  the  item's  at-
         tributes,  and  a field indicating whether to retrieve the item's at-
         tributes if the condition is not met.

       o Update  Initiates an UpdateItem operation to update an existing item.
         This  structure  specifies the primary key of the item to be updated,
         the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expres-
         sion  that must be satisfied for the update to succeed, an expression
         that defines one or more attributes to be updated, and a field  indi-
         cating  whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition is
         not met.

       o Delete  Initiates a DeleteItem operation to delete an existing  item.
         This  structure  specifies the primary key of the item to be deleted,
         the name of the table where it resides, an optional condition expres-
         sion  that must be satisfied for the deletion to succeed, and a field
         indicating whether to retrieve the item's attributes if the condition
         is not met.

       o ConditionCheck  Applies a condition to an item that is not being mod-
         ified by the transaction. This structure specifies the primary key of
         the  item  to  be  checked, the name of the table where it resides, a
         condition expression that must be satisfied for  the  transaction  to
         succeed,  and  a  field indicating whether to retrieve the item's at-
         tributes if the condition is not met.

       DynamoDB rejects the entire TransactWriteItems request if  any  of  the
       following is true:

       o A condition in one of the condition expressions is not met.

       o An ongoing operation is in the process of updating the same item.

       o There  is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
         completed.

       o An item size becomes too large (bigger than 400  KB),  a  local  sec-
         ondary  index  (LSI) becomes too large, or a similar validation error
         occurs because of changes made by the transaction.

       o The aggregate size of the items in the transaction exceeds 4 MB.

       o There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

SYNOPSIS
            transact-write-items
          --transact-items <value>
          [--return-consumed-capacity <value>]
          [--return-item-collection-metrics <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transact-items (list)
          An ordered array of up to  25  TransactWriteItem  objects,  each  of
          which  contains  a ConditionCheck , Put , Update , or Delete object.
          These can operate on items in different tables, but the tables  must
          reside  in  the  same Amazon Web Services account and Region, and no
          two of them can operate on the same item.

          (structure)
              A list of requests that can  perform  update,  put,  delete,  or
              check  operations on multiple items in one or more tables atomi-
              cally.

              ConditionCheck -> (structure)
                 A request to perform a check item operation.

                 Key -> (map)
                     The primary key of the item to be checked.  Each  element
                     consists of an attribute name and a value for that attri-
                     bute.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                        S -> (string)
                            An attribute of type String. For example:
                               "S": "Hello"

                        N -> (string)
                            An attribute of type Number. For example:
                               "N": "123.45"

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-
                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                        B -> (blob)
                            An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                               "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                        SS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                               "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                            (string)

                        NS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                               "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-
                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                            (string)

                        BS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                               "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                            (blob)

                        M -> (map)
                            An attribute of type Map. For example:
                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Represents the data for an attribute.

                               Each   attribute   value   is  described  as  a
                               name-value pair. The name is the data type, and
                               the value is the data itself.

                               N -> (string)
                                   An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                      "N": "123.45"

                                   Numbers are sent across the network to  Dy-
                                   namoDB  as strings, to maximize compatibil-

                                   An attribute of type Null. For example:
                                      "NULL": true

                               BOOL -> (boolean)
                                   An attribute of type Boolean. For example:

                               "BOOL": true

                 ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure -> (string)
                     Use  ReturnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure  to get the item
                     attributes if the ConditionCheck condition fails. For Re-
                     turnValuesOnConditionCheckFailure , the valid values are:
                     NONE and ALL_OLD.

              Put -> (structure)
                 A request to perform a PutItem operation.

                 Item -> (map)
                     A map of attribute name to attribute values, representing
                     the  primary  key  of the item to be written by PutItem .
                     All of the table's primary key attributes must be  speci-
                     fied,  and  their  data types must match those of the ta-
                     ble's key schema. If any attributes are  present  in  the
                     item  that are part of an index key schema for the table,
                     their types must match the index key schema.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical

                 ConditionExpression -> (string)
                     A condition that must be satisfied in order for a  condi-
                     tional update to succeed.

                 ExpressionAttributeNames -> (map)
                     One or more substitution tokens for attribute names in an
                     expression.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                        S -> (string)
                            An attribute of type String. For example:
                               "S": "Hello"

                        N -> (string)
                            An attribute of type Number. For example:

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-
                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                            (string)

                        BS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                               "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                            (blob)

                        M -> (map)
                            An attribute of type Map. For example:
                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Represents the data for an attribute.

                               Each   attribute   value   is  described  as  a
                               name-value pair. The name is the data type, and
                               the value is the data itself.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the  operation,  together with ConsumedCapacity for each table and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return  ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL  - The response includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --return-item-collection-metrics (string)
          Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If  set  to
          SIZE  ,  the response includes statistics about item collections (if
          any), that were modified during the operation and  are  returned  in
          the  response.  If  set to NONE (the default), no statistics are re-
          turned.

          Possible values:

          o SIZE

          o NONE

       --client-request-token (string)
          Providing a ClientRequestToken makes the call to  TransactWriteItems
          idempotent,  meaning that multiple identical calls have the same ef-
          fect as one single call.

          Although multiple identical calls using the same client request  to-
          ken produce the same result on the server (no side effects), the re-
          sponses to the calls might not be the same. If the ReturnConsumedCa-
          pacity>  parameter  is set, then the initial TransactWriteItems call
          returns the amount of write capacity units consumed  in  making  the
          changes.  Subsequent  TransactWriteItems  calls with the same client
          token return the number of read capacity units consumed  in  reading
          the item.

          A  client  request token is valid for 10 minutes after the first re-
          quest that uses it is completed. After 10 minutes, any request  with
          the  same  client token is treated as a new request. Do not resubmit
          the same request with the same client token for more  than  10  min-
          utes, or the result might not be idempotent.

          If  you  submit a request with the same client token but a change in
          other parameters within the 10-minute idempotency  window,  DynamoDB
          returns an IdempotentParameterMismatch exception.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 1: To write items atomically to one or more tables

       The following transact-write-items example updates one item and deletes
       another. The operation fails if either operation fails,  or  if  either
       item contains a Rating attribute.

       ItemCollectionMetrics -> (map)
          A list of tables that were processed by TransactWriteItems and,  for
          each  table,  information  about  any item collections that were af-
          fected by individual UpdateItem , PutItem  ,  or  DeleteItem  opera-
          tions.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 Information  about  item  collections,  if any, that were af-
                 fected by the operation. ItemCollectionMetrics  is  only  re-
                 turned  if  the  request  asked for it. If the table does not
                 have any local secondary indexes, this information is not re-

                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 SizeEstimateRangeGB -> (list)
                     An estimate of item collection size, in  gigabytes.  This
                     value is a two-element array containing a lower bound and
                     an upper bound for the estimate.  The  estimate  includes
                     the  size of all the items in the table, plus the size of
                     all attributes projected into all of the local  secondary
                     indexes  on  that  table.  Use  this  estimate to measure
                     whether a local secondary index is approaching  its  size
                     limit.

                     The  estimate  is subject to change over time; therefore,
                     do not rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
