UPDATE-TABLE()                                                  UPDATE-TABLE()



NAME
       update-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes,
       or DynamoDB Streams settings for a given table.

       You can only perform one of the following operations at once:

       o Modify the provisioned throughput settings of the table.

       o Remove a global secondary index from the table.

       o Create a new global secondary index on the table. After the index be-
         gins  backfilling,  you  can  use UpdateTable to perform other opera-
         tions.
          UpdateTable is an asynchronous operation; while it is executing, the
          table  status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING . While it is UPDATING
          , you cannot issue another UpdateTable request. When the  table  re-
          turns to the ACTIVE state, the UpdateTable operation is complete.

OPTIONS
       --attribute-definitions (list)
          An  array  of  attributes that describe the key schema for the table
          and indexes. If you are adding a new global secondary index  to  the
          table,  AttributeDefinitions  must include the key element(s) of the
          new index.

          (structure)
              Represents an attribute for describing the key  schema  for  the
              table and indexes.

              AttributeName -> (string)
                 A name for the attribute.

              AttributeType -> (string)
                 The data type for the attribute, where:

                 o S - the attribute is of type String

                 o N - the attribute is of type Number

                 o B - the attribute is of type Binary

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AttributeName=string,AttributeType=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AttributeName": "string",
              "AttributeType": "S"|"N"|"B"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table to be updated.

       --billing-mode (string)
          Controls  how  you are charged for read and write throughput and how
          you manage capacity. When switching from pay-per-request  to  provi-
          sioned  capacity,  initial  provisioned capacity values must be set.
          The initial provisioned capacity values are estimated based  on  the
          consumed  read and write capacity of your table and global secondary
          indexes over the past 30 minutes.

          o PROVISIONED - We recommend using PROVISIONED for predictable work-
            loads. PROVISIONED sets the billing mode to Provisioned Mode .

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST  -  We  recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for unpre-
            dictable workloads.  PAY_PER_REQUEST  sets  the  billing  mode  to
            On-Demand Mode .

          Possible values:

          o PROVISIONED

          o PAY_PER_REQUEST

       --provisioned-throughput (structure)
          The  new  provisioned throughput settings for the specified table or
          index.

          ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
              The maximum number of strongly  consistent  reads  consumed  per
              second  before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . For more
              information, see Specifying Read and Write Requirements  in  the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set
              to 0.

          WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
              The maximum number of writes consumed per second before DynamoDB
              returns  a  ThrottlingException  .  For  more  information,  see
              Specifying Read and Write Requirements in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB
              Developer Guide .

              If  read/write capacity mode is PAY_PER_REQUEST the value is set
              to 0.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ReadCapacityUnits=long,WriteCapacityUnits=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ReadCapacityUnits": long,
            "WriteCapacityUnits": long
          }

       --global-secondary-index-updates (list)
          An array of one or more global secondary indexes for the table.  For
          each index in the array, you can request one action:

          o Create - add a new global secondary index to the table.

          o Update - modify the provisioned throughput settings of an existing
            global secondary index.

          o Delete - remove a global secondary index from the table.

          You can create or delete only one global  secondary  index  per  Up-
          dateTable operation.

          For  more  information, see Managing Global Secondary Indexes in the
          Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          (structure)
              Represents one of the following:

              o A new global secondary index to be added to an existing table.

              o New provisioned throughput parameters for an  existing  global
                secondary index.

              o An  existing  global secondary index to be removed from an ex-
                isting table.

              Update -> (structure)
                 The name of an existing global secondary  index,  along  with
                 new provisioned throughput settings to be applied to that in-

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index to be updated.

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents the provisioned throughput  settings  for  the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For  current  minimum  and maximum provisioned throughput
                     values, see Service, Account, and  Table  Quotas  in  the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of strongly consistent reads con-
                        sumed per second  before  DynamoDB  returns  a  Throt-
                        tlingException  . For more information, see Specifying
                        Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
                        veloper Guide .

                        If  read/write  capacity  mode  is PAY_PER_REQUEST the
                        value is set to 0.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The maximum number of writes consumed per  second  be-
                        fore DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . For more
                        information, see Specifying Read  and  Write  Require-
                        ments in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                        If  read/write  capacity  mode  is PAY_PER_REQUEST the
                        value is set to 0.

              Create -> (structure)
                 The parameters required for creating a global secondary index
                 on an existing table:

                 o IndexName

                 o KeySchema

                 o AttributeDefinitions

                 o Projection

                 o ProvisionedThroughput

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index to be created.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The key schema for the global secondary index.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key
                        schema specifies the attributes that make up the  pri-
                        mary  key  of a table, or the key attributes of an in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the  primary  key.  For  example, a simple primary key
                        would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for  the
                        partition  key). A composite primary key would require
                        one KeySchemaElement for the partition  key,  and  an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A  KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attri-
                        bute (not a nested attribute). The data type  must  be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The partition key of an item is also  known  as
                               its  hash attribute . The term "hash attribute"
                               derives from DynamoDB's usage  of  an  internal
                               hash  function  to evenly distribute data items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The  sort  key  of an item is also known as its
                               range attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the same partition  key  physically  close  to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from
                     the table into an index. These are  in  addition  to  the
                     primary  key  attributes  and index key attributes, which
                     are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The set of attributes that are projected into the  in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY  ,  the secondary index will include other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents  the  non-key attribute names which will be
                        projected into the index.

                        For local secondary indexes, the total count  of  Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same
                        attribute  into  two different indexes, this counts as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents the provisioned throughput  settings  for  the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For  current  minimum  and maximum provisioned throughput
                     values, see Service, Account, and  Table  Quotas  in  the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of strongly consistent reads con-
                        sumed per second  before  DynamoDB  returns  a  Throt-
                        tlingException  . For more information, see Specifying
                        Read and Write Requirements in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
                        veloper Guide .

                        If  read/write  capacity  mode  is PAY_PER_REQUEST the
                        value is set to 0.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)

                        value is set to 0.

              Delete -> (structure)
                 The name of an existing global secondary index to be removed.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index to be deleted.

       --stream-specification (structure)
          Represents the DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.

          NOTE:
              You receive a ResourceInUseException if  you  try  to  enable  a
              stream  on  a  table that already has a stream, or if you try to
              disable a stream on a table that doesn't have a stream.

          StreamEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or disabled
              (false) on the table.

          StreamViewType -> (string)
              When an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType determines
              what information is written to the stream for this table.  Valid
              values for StreamViewType are:

              o KEYS_ONLY  -  Only the key attributes of the modified item are
                written to the stream.

              o NEW_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appears after it was  modi-
                fied, is written to the stream.

              o OLD_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appeared before it was mod-
                ified, is written to the stream.

              o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES - Both the new and the old item  images  of
                the item are written to the stream.

       --sse-specification (structure)
          The new server-side encryption settings for the specified table.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether server-side encryption is done using an Amazon
              Web Services managed key or an Amazon Web Services owned key. If
              enabled (true), server-side encryption type is set to KMS and an
              Amazon Web Services managed key is used (KMS charges apply).  If

              o KMS - Server-side encryption that uses Key Management Service.
                The  key  is stored in your account and is managed by KMS (KMS
                charges apply).

          KMSMasterKeyId -> (string)
              The KMS key that should be used for the KMS encryption. To spec-
              ify  a  key,  use  its key ID, Amazon Resource Name (ARN), alias
              name, or alias ARN. Note that you should only provide  this  pa-
              rameter  if  the  key is different from the default DynamoDB key
              alias/aws/dynamodb .

              bles.

          (structure)
              Represents one of the following:

              o A new replica to be added to an  existing  regional  table  or
                global  table. This request invokes the CreateTableReplica ac-
                tion in the destination Region.

              o New parameters for an existing replica. This  request  invokes
                the UpdateTable action in the destination Region.

              o An  existing  replica  to  be deleted. The request invokes the
                DeleteTableReplica action in the destination Region,  deleting
                the replica and all if its items in the destination Region.

              NOTE:
                 When you manually remove a table or global table replica, you

          DARD and STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o STANDARD_INFREQUENT_ACCESS

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To modify a table's billing mode

OUTPUT
       TableDescription -> (structure)
          Represents the properties of the table.

          AttributeDefinitions -> (list)
              An array of AttributeDefinition objects. Each of  these  objects
              describes one attribute in the table and index key schema.

              Each AttributeDefinition object in this array is composed of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o AttributeType - The data type for the attribute.

              (structure)
                 Represents an attribute for describing the key schema for the
                 table and indexes.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     A name for the attribute.

                 AttributeType -> (string)
                     The data type for the attribute, where:

                     o S - the attribute is of type String

                     o N - the attribute is of type Number

                     o B - the attribute is of type Binary

          TableName -> (string)
              The name of the table.

          KeySchema -> (list)
              The primary key structure for the table.  Each  KeySchemaElement
              consists of:

              o AttributeName - The name of the attribute.

              o KeyType - The role of the attribute:

                o HASH - partition key

                o RANGE - sort key

              NOTE:
                 The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attri-
                 bute . The term "hash attribute" derives from DynamoDB's  us-
                 age  of  an  internal hash function to evenly distribute data
                 items across partitions, based on their partition key values.

                 The sort key of an item is also known as its range  attribute
                 .  The  term  "range attribute" derives from the way DynamoDB
                 stores items with the same partition key physically close to-
                 gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

              For  more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the
              Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              (structure)
                 Represents a single element of a key  schema.  A  key  schema
                 specifies  the  attributes  that make up the primary key of a
                 table, or the key attributes of an index.

                 A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one  attribute  of  the
                 primary  key. For example, a simple primary key would be rep-
                 resented by one KeySchemaElement (for the partition  key).  A
                 composite  primary key would require one KeySchemaElement for
                 the partition key, and another KeySchemaElement for the  sort
                 key.

                 A KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attribute (not
                 a nested attribute). The data type must  be  one  of  String,
                 Number,  or  Binary.  The attribute cannot be nested within a
                 List or a Map.

                 AttributeName -> (string)
                     The name of a key attribute.

                 KeyType -> (string)
                     The role that this key attribute will assume:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's usage of an internal hash function to  evenly
                        distribute  data  items  across  partitions,  based on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute  . The term "range attribute" derives from the
                        way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition  key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

          TableStatus -> (string)
              The current state of the table:

              o CREATING - The table is being created.

              o UPDATING - The table/index configuration is being updated. The
                table/index  remains available for data operations when UPDAT-
                ING .

              o DELETING - The table is being deleted.

              o ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

              o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key used to  en-
                crypt the table in inaccessible. Table operations may fail due
                to failure to use the KMS key. DynamoDB will initiate the  ta-
                ble archival process when a table's KMS key remains inaccessi-
                ble for more than seven days.

              o ARCHIVING - The table is being archived.  Operations  are  not
                allowed until archival is complete.

              o ARCHIVED - The table has been archived. See the ArchivalReason
                for more information.

          CreationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the table was created, in UNIX epoch time
              format.

          ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
              The provisioned throughput settings for the table, consisting of
              read and write capacity units, along with data  about  increases
              and decreases.

              LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput increase
                 for this table.

              LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time of the last provisioned throughput decrease
                 for this table.

              NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                 The number of provisioned throughput decreases for this table
                 during this UTC calendar day. For current maximums on  provi-
                 sioned  throughput decreases, see Service, Account, and Table
                 Quotas in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

              ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The maximum number of strongly consistent reads consumed  per
                 second  before DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException . Even-
                 tually consistent reads require  less  effort  than  strongly
                 consistent  reads,  so  a setting of 50 ReadCapacityUnits per
                 second provides 100 eventually  consistent  ReadCapacityUnits
                 per second.

              WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                 The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second before Dy-
                 namoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

          TableSizeBytes -> (long)
              The total size of the specified table, in  bytes.  DynamoDB  up-
              dates  this  value approximately every six hours. Recent changes
              might not be reflected in this value.

          ItemCount -> (long)
              The number of items in the  specified  table.  DynamoDB  updates
              this  value  approximately every six hours. Recent changes might
              not be reflected in this value.

          TableArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the  ta-
              ble.

          TableId -> (string)
              Unique  identifier  for  the table for which the backup was cre-
              ated.

          BillingModeSummary -> (structure)
              Contains the details for the read/write capacity mode.

              BillingMode -> (string)
                 Controls how you are charged for read  and  write  throughput
                 and  how  you  manage  capacity.  This setting can be changed
                 later.

                 o PROVISIONED - Sets the read/write capacity mode  to  PROVI-
                   SIONED  .  We  recommend  using PROVISIONED for predictable
                   workloads.

                 o PAY_PER_REQUEST - Sets  the  read/write  capacity  mode  to
                   PAY_PER_REQUEST  .  We  recommend using PAY_PER_REQUEST for
                   unpredictable workloads.

              LastUpdateToPayPerRequestDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Represents the time when PAY_PER_REQUEST was last set as  the
                 read/write capacity mode.

          LocalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              Represents  one  or  more  local secondary indexes on the table.
              Each index is scoped to a given partition key value. Tables with
              one  or more local secondary indexes are subject to an item col-
              lection size limit, where the amount of data within a given item
              collection cannot exceed 10 GB. Each element is composed of:

              o IndexName - The name of the local secondary index.

              o KeySchema  -  Specifies the complete index key schema. The at-
                tribute names in the key schema must  be  between  1  and  255
                characters  (inclusive).  The  key  schema must begin with the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied  (projected)
                from  the  table  into the index. These are in addition to the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically  projected.  Each  attribute specification is com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are  projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE  -  Only  the  specified table attributes are pro-
                    jected into the index. The list of projected attributes is
                    in NonKeyAttributes .

                  o ALL  -  All of the table attributes are projected into the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more  non-key  attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count of attributes provided in  NonKeyAttributes  ,  summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you project the same attribute into two  different  indexes,
                  this  counts as two distinct attributes when determining the
                  total.

              o IndexSizeBytes - Represents the total size of  the  index,  in
                bytes.  DynamoDB  updates  this  value approximately every six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o ItemCount - Represents the number of items in the  index.  Dy-
                namoDB  updates  this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              If the table is in the DELETING state, no information about  in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a local secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     Represents the name of the local secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The  complete  key  schema for the local secondary index,
                     consisting of one or more pairs of  attribute  names  and
                     key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's  usage of an internal hash function to evenly
                        distribute data  items  across  partitions,  based  on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute . The term "range attribute" derives from  the
                        way  DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key
                        schema specifies the attributes that make up the  pri-
                        mary  key  of a table, or the key attributes of an in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the  primary  key.  For  example, a simple primary key
                        would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for  the
                        partition  key). A composite primary key would require
                        one KeySchemaElement for the partition  key,  and  an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A  KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attri-
                        bute (not a nested attribute). The data type  must  be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The partition key of an item is also  known  as
                               its  hash attribute . The term "hash attribute"
                               derives from DynamoDB's usage  of  an  internal
                               hash  function  to evenly distribute data items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The  sort  key  of an item is also known as its
                               range attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the same partition  key  physically  close  to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from
                     the table into the global secondary index. These  are  in
                     addition  to the primary key attributes and index key at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The set of attributes that are projected into the  in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY  ,  the secondary index will include other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents  the  non-key attribute names which will be
                        projected into the index.

                        For local secondary indexes, the total count  of  Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same
                        attribute  into  two different indexes, this counts as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates  this value approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB  up-
                     dates  this  value  approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  uniquely  identifies
                     the index.

          GlobalSecondaryIndexes -> (list)
              The  global  secondary indexes, if any, on the table. Each index
              is scoped to a given partition key value. Each element  is  com-
              posed of:

              o Backfilling  -  If  true,  then  the index is currently in the
                backfilling phase. Backfilling occurs only when a  new  global
                secondary  index  is  added to the table. It is the process by
                which DynamoDB populates the new index with data from the  ta-
                ble.  (This  attribute  does  not appear for indexes that were
                created during a CreateTable operation.)  You  can  delete  an
                index  that is being created during the Backfilling phase when
                IndexStatus is set to CREATING and Backfilling  is  true.  You
                can't  delete the index that is being created when IndexStatus
                is set to CREATING and Backfilling is false.  (This  attribute
                does  not  appear  for indexes that were created during a Cre-
                ateTable operation.)

              o IndexName - The name of the global secondary index.

              o IndexSizeBytes - The total size of the global secondary index,
                in  bytes. DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six
                hours. Recent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o IndexStatus - The current status of the global  secondary  in-
                dex:

                o CREATING - The index is being created.

                o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

              o ItemCount - The number of items in the global secondary index.
                DynamoDB updates this value approximately every six hours. Re-
                cent changes might not be reflected in this value.

              o KeySchema  -  Specifies the complete index key schema. The at-
                tribute names in the key schema must  be  between  1  and  255
                characters  (inclusive).  The  key  schema must begin with the
                same partition key as the table.

              o Projection - Specifies attributes that are copied  (projected)
                from  the  table  into the index. These are in addition to the
                primary key attributes and index key attributes, which are au-
                tomatically  projected.  Each  attribute specification is com-
                posed of:

                o ProjectionType - One of the following:

                  o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are  projected
                    into the index.

                  o INCLUDE  -  In  addition  to  the  attributes described in
                    KEYS_ONLY , the secondary index will include other non-key
                    attributes that you specify.

                  o ALL  -  All of the table attributes are projected into the
                    index.

                o NonKeyAttributes - A list of one or more  non-key  attribute
                  names that are projected into the secondary index. The total
                  count of attributes provided in  NonKeyAttributes  ,  summed
                  across all of the secondary indexes, must not exceed 100. If
                  you project the same attribute into two  different  indexes,
                  this  counts as two distinct attributes when determining the
                  total.

              o ProvisionedThroughput - The  provisioned  throughput  settings
                for  the  global secondary index, consisting of read and write
                capacity units, along with data about increases and decreases.

              If the table is in the DELETING state, no information about  in-
              dexes will be returned.

              (structure)
                 Represents the properties of a global secondary index.

                 IndexName -> (string)
                     The name of the global secondary index.

                 KeySchema -> (list)
                     The  complete  key  schema  for a global secondary index,
                     which consists of one or more pairs  of  attribute  names
                     and key types:

                     o HASH - partition key

                     o RANGE - sort key

                     NOTE:
                        The partition key of an item is also known as its hash
                        attribute . The term "hash attribute" derives from Dy-
                        namoDB's  usage of an internal hash function to evenly
                        distribute data  items  across  partitions,  based  on
                        their partition key values.

                        The sort key of an item is also known as its range at-
                        tribute . The term "range attribute" derives from  the
                        way  DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key
                        physically close together, in sorted order by the sort
                        key value.

                     (structure)
                        Represents  a  single  element  of a key schema. A key
                        schema specifies the attributes that make up the  pri-
                        mary  key  of a table, or the key attributes of an in-
                        dex.

                        A KeySchemaElement represents exactly one attribute of
                        the  primary  key.  For  example, a simple primary key
                        would be represented by one KeySchemaElement (for  the
                        partition  key). A composite primary key would require
                        one KeySchemaElement for the partition  key,  and  an-
                        other KeySchemaElement for the sort key.

                        A  KeySchemaElement must be a scalar, top-level attri-
                        bute (not a nested attribute). The data type  must  be
                        one of String, Number, or Binary. The attribute cannot
                        be nested within a List or a Map.

                        AttributeName -> (string)
                            The name of a key attribute.

                        KeyType -> (string)
                            The role that this key attribute will assume:

                            o HASH - partition key

                            o RANGE - sort key

                            NOTE:
                               The partition key of an item is also  known  as
                               its  hash attribute . The term "hash attribute"
                               derives from DynamoDB's usage  of  an  internal
                               hash  function  to evenly distribute data items
                               across partitions, based on their partition key
                               values.

                               The  sort  key  of an item is also known as its
                               range attribute . The  term  "range  attribute"
                               derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with
                               the same partition  key  physically  close  to-
                               gether, in sorted order by the sort key value.

                 Projection -> (structure)
                     Represents  attributes  that  are copied (projected) from
                     the table into the global secondary index. These  are  in
                     addition  to the primary key attributes and index key at-
                     tributes, which are automatically projected.

                     ProjectionType -> (string)
                        The set of attributes that are projected into the  in-
                        dex:

                        o KEYS_ONLY - Only the index and primary keys are pro-
                          jected into the index.

                        o INCLUDE - In addition to the attributes described in
                          KEYS_ONLY  ,  the secondary index will include other
                          non-key attributes that you specify.

                        o ALL - All of the table attributes are projected into
                          the index.

                     NonKeyAttributes -> (list)
                        Represents  the  non-key attribute names which will be
                        projected into the index.

                        For local secondary indexes, the total count  of  Non-
                        KeyAttributes summed across all of the local secondary
                        indexes, must not exceed 100. If you project the  same
                        attribute  into  two different indexes, this counts as
                        two distinct attributes when determining the total.

                        (string)

                 IndexStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the global secondary index:

                     o CREATING - The index is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The index is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The index is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The index is ready for use.

                 Backfilling -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether the  index  is  currently  backfilling.
                     Backfilling  is the process of reading items from the ta-
                     ble and determining whether they can be added to the  in-
                     dex.  (Not  all items will qualify: For example, a parti-
                     tion key cannot have any duplicate values.)  If  an  item
                     can be added to the index, DynamoDB will do so. After all
                     items have been processed, the backfilling  operation  is
                     complete and Backfilling is false.

                     You  can delete an index that is being created during the
                     Backfilling phase when IndexStatus is set to CREATING and
                     Backfilling  is  true. You can't delete the index that is
                     being created when IndexStatus is  set  to  CREATING  and
                     Backfilling is false.

                     NOTE:
                        For indexes that were created during a CreateTable op-
                        eration, the Backfilling attribute does not appear  in
                        the DescribeTable output.

                 ProvisionedThroughput -> (structure)
                     Represents  the  provisioned  throughput settings for the
                     specified global secondary index.

                     For current minimum and  maximum  provisioned  throughput
                     values,  see  Service,  Account,  and Table Quotas in the
                     Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                     LastIncreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The date and time of the last  provisioned  throughput
                        increase for this table.

                     LastDecreaseDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The  date  and time of the last provisioned throughput
                        decrease for this table.

                     NumberOfDecreasesToday -> (long)
                        The number of  provisioned  throughput  decreases  for
                        this  table  during this UTC calendar day. For current
                        maximums  on  provisioned  throughput  decreases,  see
                        Service,  Account,  and Table Quotas in the Amazon Dy-
                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                     ReadCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The maximum number of strongly consistent  reads  con-
                        sumed  per  second  before  DynamoDB  returns a Throt-
                        tlingException . Eventually consistent  reads  require
                        less  effort than strongly consistent reads, so a set-
                        ting of 50 ReadCapacityUnits per second  provides  100
                        eventually consistent ReadCapacityUnits per second.

                     WriteCapacityUnits -> (long)
                        The  maximum  number of writes consumed per second be-
                        fore DynamoDB returns a ThrottlingException .

                 IndexSizeBytes -> (long)
                     The total size of the specified index, in bytes. DynamoDB
                     updates  this value approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 ItemCount -> (long)
                     The number of items in the specified index. DynamoDB  up-
                     dates  this  value  approximately every six hours. Recent
                     changes might not be reflected in this value.

                 IndexArn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that  uniquely  identifies
                     the index.

          StreamSpecification -> (structure)
              The current DynamoDB Streams configuration for the table.

              StreamEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether DynamoDB Streams is enabled (true) or dis-
                 abled (false) on the table.

              StreamViewType -> (string)
                 When an item in the table is modified, StreamViewType  deter-
                 mines  what information is written to the stream for this ta-
                 ble. Valid values for StreamViewType are:

                 o KEYS_ONLY - Only the key attributes of  the  modified  item
                   are written to the stream.

                 o NEW_IMAGE  -  The  entire  item, as it appears after it was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o OLD_IMAGE - The entire item, as it appeared before  it  was
                   modified, is written to the stream.

                 o NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES  -  Both the new and the old item images
                   of the item are written to the stream.

          LatestStreamLabel -> (string)
              A timestamp, in ISO 8601 format, for this stream.

              Note that LatestStreamLabel is not a unique identifier  for  the
              stream,  because it is possible that a stream from another table
              might have the same timestamp. However, the combination  of  the
              following three elements is guaranteed to be unique:

              o Amazon Web Services customer ID

              o Table name

              o StreamLabel

          LatestStreamArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that uniquely identifies the lat-
              est stream for this table.

          GlobalTableVersion -> (string)
              Represents the version of global tables in use, if the table  is
              replicated across Amazon Web Services Regions.

          Replicas -> (list)
              Represents replicas of the table.

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o UPDATING - The replica is being updated.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED  -  The replica is inaccessible because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for  more  than  20  hours,  DynamoDB will remove this
                        replica from the replication group. The  replica  will
                        not  be  deleted and replication will stop from and to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key  used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If  the  KMS key remains inaccessible for more than 20
                        hours, DynamoDB will  remove  this  replica  from  the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.

                 archived to, when applicable in the archival reason.  If  you
                 wish  to restore this backup to the same table name, you will
                 need to delete the original table.
