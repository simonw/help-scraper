TRANSACT-GET-ITEMS()                                      TRANSACT-GET-ITEMS()



NAME
       transact-get-items -

DESCRIPTION
          TransactGetItems  is  a  synchronous  operation  that atomically re-
          trieves multiple items from one or more tables  (but  not  from  in-
          dexes)  in  a single account and Region. A TransactGetItems call can
          contain up to 25 TransactGetItem objects, each of which  contains  a
          Get structure that specifies an item to retrieve from a table in the
          account and Region. A call to TransactGetItems cannot retrieve items
          from  tables in more than one Amazon Web Services account or Region.
          The aggregate size of the items in the transaction cannot  exceed  4
          MB.

       DynamoDB rejects the entire TransactGetItems request if any of the fol-
       lowing is true:

       o A conflicting operation is in the process of updating an item  to  be
         read.

       o There  is insufficient provisioned capacity for the transaction to be
         completed.

       o There is a user error, such as an invalid data format.

       o The aggregate size of the items in the transaction  cannot  exceed  4
         MB.

SYNOPSIS
            transact-get-items
          --transact-items <value>
          [--return-consumed-capacity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --transact-items (list)
          An  ordered array of up to 25 TransactGetItem objects, each of which
          contains a Get structure.

          (structure)
              Specifies an item to be retrieved as part of the transaction.

              Get -> (structure)
                 Contains the primary key that identifies the item to get, to-
                 gether with the name of the table that contains the item, and
                 optionally the specific attributes of the item to retrieve.

                 Key -> (map)
                     A map of attribute names to AttributeValue  objects  that
                     specifies the primary key of the item to retrieve.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                        namoDB Developer Guide .

                        S -> (string)
                            An attribute of type String. For example:
                               "S": "Hello"

                        N -> (string)
                            An attribute of type Number. For example:
                               "N": "123.45"

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings,  to  maximize  compatibility  across lan-
                            guages and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB  treats
                            them  as  number  type attributes for mathematical
                            operations.

                        B -> (blob)
                            An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                               "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                        SS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                               "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                            (string)

                        NS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                               "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings,  to  maximize  compatibility  across lan-
                            guages and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB  treats

                            An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                               "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                            (blob)

                        M -> (map)
                            An attribute of type Map. For example:
                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (structure)
                               Represents the data for an attribute.

                               Each  attribute  value  is   described   as   a
                               name-value pair. The name is the data type, and
                               the value is the data itself.

                               "BOOL": true

                 TableName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the table from which to retrieve the speci-
                     fied item.

                 ProjectionExpression -> (string)
                     A string that identifies one or more  attributes  of  the
                     specified item to retrieve from the table. The attributes
                     in the expression must be separated by commas. If no  at-
                     tribute  names  are specified, then all attributes of the
                     specified item are returned. If any of the requested  at-
                     tributes are not found, they do not appear in the result.

                 ExpressionAttributeNames -> (map)
                     One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in
                     the ProjectionExpression parameter.

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          A value of TOTAL causes consumed  capacity  information  to  be  re-
          turned, and a value of NONE prevents that information from being re-
          turned. No other value is valid.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConsumedCapacity -> (list)
          If the ReturnConsumedCapacity value was TOTAL , this is an array  of
          ConsumedCapacity  objects, one for each table addressed by Transact-
          GetItem objects in the TransactItems parameter. These ConsumedCapac-
          ity objects report the read-capacity units consumed by the Transact-
          GetItems call in that table.

          the name-value pairs that are the projected attributes  of  the  re-
          quested item.

          If  a requested item could not be retrieved, the corresponding Item-
          Response object is Null, or if the requested item has  no  projected
          attributes, the corresponding ItemResponse object is an empty Map.

                 bute value.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

                     For more information, see Data Types in  the  Amazon  Dy-
                     namoDB Developer Guide .

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                            "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is

                            S -> (string)
                               An attribute of type String. For example:
                                   "S": "Hello"

                            N -> (string)
                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as  strings,  to  maximize compatibility across
                               languages  and  libraries.  However,   DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is
                            the data itself.
