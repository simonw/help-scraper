PUT-ITEM()                                                          PUT-ITEM()



NAME
       put-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item
       that has the same primary key as the new item  already  exists  in  the
       specified  table,  the  new item completely replaces the existing item.
       You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with
       the  specified  primary key doesn't exist), or replace an existing item
       if it has certain attribute values. You can return the item's attribute
       values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter.

       When  you add an item, the primary key attributes are the only required
       attributes.

       Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute  values
       of  type  String and Binary must have a length greater than zero if the
       attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index. Set type at-
       tributes cannot be empty.

       Invalid  Requests  with  empty  values  will be rejected with a Valida-
       tionException exception.

       NOTE:
          To prevent a new item from replacing an existing item, use a  condi-
          tional  expression  that  contains the attribute_not_exists function
          with the name of the attribute being used as the partition  key  for
          the  table.  Since every record must contain that attribute, the at-
          tribute_not_exists function will only succeed if  no  matching  item
          exists.

       zon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table to contain the item. You can also provide  the
          Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parameter.

       --item (map)
          A  map  of  attribute name/value pairs, one for each attribute. Only
          the primary key attributes are required; you can optionally  provide
          other attribute name-value pairs for the item.

          You  must provide all of the attributes for the primary key. For ex-
          ample, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide  a  value
          for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide
          both values for both the partition key and the sort key.

          If you specify any attributes that are part of an  index  key,  then
          the  data  types for those attributes must match those of the schema
          in the table's attribute definition.

          Empty String and Binary attribute values are allowed. Attribute val-
          ues  of  type String and Binary must have a length greater than zero
          if the attribute is used as a key attribute for a table or index.

          For more information about primary keys, see Primary Key in the Ama-
          zon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          Each element in the Item map is an AttributeValue object.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)

                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

       --expected (map)
          This is a legacy parameter.  Use  ConditionExpression  instead.  For

          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents a condition to be compared with an  attribute  value.
              This  condition  can  be used with DeleteItem , PutItem , or Up-
              dateItem operations; if the comparison evaluates  to  true,  the
              operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use Ex-
              pectedAttributeValue in one of two different ways:

              o Use AttributeValueList to specify one or more values  to  com-
                pare  against  an attribute. Use ComparisonOperator to specify
                how you want to perform  the  comparison.  If  the  comparison
                evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds.

              o Use  Value  to  specify  a  value  that  DynamoDB will compare
                against an attribute. If the values  match,  then  ExpectedAt-
                tributeValue  evaluates  to true and the conditional operation
                succeeds. Optionally, you can also set Exists to false,  indi-
                cating  that  you do not expect to find the attribute value in
                the table. In this case, the  conditional  operation  succeeds
                only if the comparison evaluates to false.
                 Value and Exists are incompatible with AttributeValueList and
                 ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use both sets of param-
                 eters at once, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException ex-
                 ception.

              Value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for the expected attribute.

                 Each attribute value is described as a name-value  pair.  The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                        "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                 SS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                        "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                     (string)

                 NS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 BS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                        "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each attribute value  is  described  as  a  name-value
                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                     (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                            (string)

                               "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                            An attribute of type List. For example:
                               "L": [  {"S":  "Cookies"}  ,  {"S":  "Coffee"},
                               {"N": "3.14159"}]

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:
                        "NULL": true

                 BOOL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

              Exists -> (boolean)
                 Causes  DynamoDB  to  evaluate  the value before attempting a
                 conditional operation:

                 o If Exists is true , DynamoDB will check to see if that  at-
                   tribute  value already exists in the table. If it is found,
                   then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the opera-
                   tion fails with a ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 o If  Exists  is  false , DynamoDB assumes that the attribute
                   value does not exist in the table. If  in  fact  the  value
                   does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the opera-
                   tion succeeds. If the value is found, despite  the  assump-
                   tion  that  it  does  not exist, the operation fails with a
                   ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 The default setting for Exists is true  .  If  you  supply  a
                 Value  all  by itself, DynamoDB assumes the attribute exists:
                 You don't have to set Exists to true , because it is implied.

                 DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if:

                 o Exists is true but there is no Value to check. (You  expect
                   a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.)

                 o Exists  is false but you also provide a Value . (You cannot
                   expect an attribute to have a value, while  also  expecting
                   it not to exist.)

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A  comparator  for evaluating attributes in the AttributeVal-
                 ueList . For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL |  CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ  :  Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including
                   lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can  contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue  element  of  type  String,  Number, Binary,
                   String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item  contains
                   an  AttributeValue element of a different type than the one
                   provided in the request, the value does not match. For  ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing  lists  and  maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue of type String, Number,  Binary,  String
                   Set,  Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue of a different type than the one  provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE  :  Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not a set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT  :  Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type).  If  an item contains an AttributeValue element of a
                   different type than the one provided in  the  request,  the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE  :  Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can con-
                   tain only one AttributeValue element of type  String,  Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} .  Also,  {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT  :  Greater  than.   AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or  Bi-
                   nary  (not  a  set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL  : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the existence  of  an  attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result  is
                     a  Boolean true . This result is because the attribute "a
                     " exists; its data type is not relevant to  the  NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL  : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NULL , the  result  is  a
                     Boolean  false  .  This is because the attribute "a " ex-
                     ists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL  compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS  :  Checks  for  a subsequence, or value in a set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the target attribute of the comparison is of  type  String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the input. If the target attribute of the comparison  is  a
                   set  ("SS  ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates
                   to true if it finds an exact match with any member  of  the
                   set.  CONTAINS  is  supported for lists: When evaluating "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS  : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or ab-
                   sence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If the  target  attribute  of  the
                   comparison  is  a  String, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a substring match. If the  target  attribute  of
                   the  comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put.  If  the  target  attribute of the comparison is a set
                   ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates  to
                   true  if it does not find an exact match with any member of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing  "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain  only  one  AttributeValue of type String or Binary
                   (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute  of  the
                   comparison  must  be of type String or Binary (not a Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList  can  contain one or more AttributeValue elements of
                   type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes  are  com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN  :  Greater  than  or equal to the first value, and
                   less than or equal to  the  second  value.    AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).  A
                   target  attribute  matches  if  the target value is greater
                   than, or equal to, the first  element  and  less  than,  or
                   equal  to,  the  second element. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  .  Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One  or  more  values to evaluate against the supplied attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String  value  comparisons  for greater than, equals, or less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is  greater  than A , and a is greater than B . For a list of
                 code                       values,                        see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary  data  as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 For  information  on  specifying data types in JSON, see JSON
                 Data Format in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                            "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each  attribute value is described as a name-value
                            pair. The name is the data type, and the value  is
                            the data itself.

                               An attribute of type Number. For example:
                                   "N": "123.45"

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as  strings,  to  maximize compatibility across
                               languages  and  libraries.  However,   DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                            NULL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Null. For example:
                                   "NULL": true

                            BOOL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Boolean. For example:

                     L -> (list)
                        An attribute of type List. For example:

       --return-values (string)
          Use ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they  ap-
          peared  before  they  were  updated  with  the  PutItem request. For
          PutItem , the valid values are:

          o NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE ,
            then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return-
            Values .)

          o ALL_OLD - If PutItem overwrote an attribute name-value pair,  then
            the content of the old item is returned.

          The values returned are strongly consistent.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          NOTE:
              The  ReturnValues  parameter  is used by several DynamoDB opera-
              tions; however, PutItem does not recognize any values other than
              NONE or ALL_OLD .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ALL_OLD

          o UPDATED_OLD

          o ALL_NEW

          o UPDATED_NEW

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the  operation,  together with ConsumedCapacity for each table and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return  ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL  - The response includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --return-item-collection-metrics (string)
          Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If  set  to
          SIZE  ,  the response includes statistics about item collections, if
          any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the re-
          sponse. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SIZE

          o NONE

       --conditional-operator (string)
          This  is  a  legacy  parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
          more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
          veloper Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --condition-expression (string)
          A  condition  that  must  be  satisfied  in  order for a conditional
          PutItem operation to succeed.

          An expression can contain any of the following:

          o Functions:  attribute_exists  |  attribute_not_exists   |   attri-
            bute_type  |  contains | begins_with | size   These function names
            are case-sensitive.

          o Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN

          o Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT

          For more information on condition expressions, see Condition Expres-
          sions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --expression-attribute-names (map)
          One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in an expres-
          sion. The following are  some  use  cases  for  using  ExpressionAt-
          tributeNames :

          o To  access  an  attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB re-
            served word.

          o To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an  attribute
            name in an expression.

          o To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being mis-
            interpreted in an expression.

          Use the # character in an expression  to  dereference  an  attribute
          name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

          o Percentile

          The  name  of  this  attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
          cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list  of
          reserved  words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide ). To work around this, you could specify  the  following  for
          ExpressionAttributeNames :

          o {"#P":"Percentile"}

          You  could  then  use this substitution in an expression, as in this
          example:

          o #P = :val

          NOTE:
              Tokens that begin with the : character are expression  attribute
              values , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

          For  more  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying
          Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expression-attribute-values (map)
          One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

          Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference  an  at-
          tribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
          the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:
              Available | Backordered | Discontinued

          You would first need to specify  ExpressionAttributeValues  as  fol-
          lows:
              {    ":avail":{"S":"Available"},    ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
              ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }

          You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
              ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)

          For more information on expression attribute values,  see  Condition
          Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     "3.14159"}]

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

       --return-values-on-condition-check-failure (string)
          An optional parameter that returns the item attributes for a PutItem
          operation that failed a condition check.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_OLD

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To add an item to a table

       The  following  put-item example adds a new item to the MusicCollection
       table.

          aws dynamodb put-item \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --item file://item.json \
              --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL \
              --return-item-collection-metrics SIZE

       Contents of item.json:

          {
              "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
              "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"},
              "AlbumTitle": {"S": "Greatest Hits"}
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ConsumedCapacity": {
                  "TableName": "MusicCollection",
                  "CapacityUnits": 1.0
              },
              "ItemCollectionMetrics": {
                  "ItemCollectionKey": {
                      "Artist": {
                          "S": "No One You Know"
                      }
                  },
                  "SizeEstimateRangeGB": [
                      0.0,
                      1.0
                  ]
              }
          }

       oper Guide.

       Example 2: To conditionally overwrite an item in a table

       The  following put-item example overwrites an existing item in the Mus-
       icCollection table only if that existing item has an AlbumTitle  attri-
       bute  with  a  value of Greatest Hits. The command returns the previous
       value of the item.

          aws dynamodb put-item \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --item file://item.json \
              --condition-expression "#A = :A" \
              --expression-attribute-names file://names.json \
              --expression-attribute-values file://values.json \
              --return-values ALL_OLD

       Contents of item.json:

          {
              "Artist": {"S": "No One You Know"},
              "SongTitle": {"S": "Call Me Today"},
              "AlbumTitle": {"S": "Somewhat Famous"}
          }

       Contents of names.json:

          {
              "#A": "AlbumTitle"
          }

       Contents of values.json:

          {
              ":A": {"S": "Greatest Hits"}
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Attributes": {
                  "AlbumTitle": {
                      "S": "Greatest Hits"
                  },
                  "Artist": {
                      "S": "No One You Know"
                  },
                  "SongTitle": {
                      "S": "Call Me Today"
                  }
              }
          }

       If the key already exists, you should see the following output:

          A client error (ConditionalCheckFailedException) occurred when calling the PutItem operation: The conditional request failed.

       For more information, see Writing an Item in the Amazon DynamoDB Devel-
       oper Guide.

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (map)
          The  attribute values as they appeared before the PutItem operation,
          but only if ReturnValues is specified as  ALL_OLD  in  the  request.
          Each element consists of an attribute name and an attribute value.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for

       ItemCollectionMetrics -> (structure)
          Information  about  item  collections, if any, that were affected by
          the PutItem operation. ItemCollectionMetrics is only returned if the
          ReturnItemCollectionMetrics  parameter  was  specified. If the table
          does not have any local secondary indexes, this information  is  not
          returned in the response.

          Each ItemCollectionMetrics element consists of:

          o ItemCollectionKey  -  The  partition key value of the item collec-
            tion. This is the same as the partition key value of the item  it-
            self.

          o SizeEstimateRangeGB  - An estimate of item collection size, in gi-
            gabytes. This value is a  two-element  array  containing  a  lower
            bound  and  an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes
            the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of  all  at-
            tributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on that
            table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary  in-
            dex  is  approaching  its  size  limit. The estimate is subject to
            change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accu-
            racy of the estimate.

          ItemCollectionKey -> (map)
              The  partition  key  value of the item collection. This value is
              the same as the partition key value of the item.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each attribute value is described as a name-value  pair.  The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                        pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is the
                        data itself.

                               "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                        SS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                               "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                            (string)

                        NS -> (list)
                            An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-
                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                     An attribute of type List. For example:
                        "L": [  {"S":  "Cookies"}  ,  {"S":  "Coffee"},  {"N":
                        "3.14159"}]

                     (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

          SizeEstimateRangeGB -> (list)
              An estimate of item collection size, in gigabytes. This value is
              a two-element array containing a lower bound and an upper  bound
              for  the  estimate.  The  estimate  includes the size of all the
              items in the table, plus the size of  all  attributes  projected
              into  all of the local secondary indexes on that table. Use this
              estimate to measure whether a local secondary index is approach-
              ing its size limit.

              The  estimate  is subject to change over time; therefore, do not
              rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
