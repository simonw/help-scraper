CREATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()                                    CREATE-GLOBAL-TABLE()



NAME
       create-global-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a global table from an existing table. A global table creates a
       replication relationship between two or more DynamoDB tables  with  the
       same table name in the provided Regions.

       WARNING:
          This operation only applies to Version 2017.11.29 (Legacy) of global
          tables. We recommend using Version 2019.11.21 (Current) when  creat-
          ing  new  global  tables, as it provides greater flexibility, higher
          efficiency  and  consumes  less  write  capacity   than   2017.11.29
          (Legacy).  To determine which version you are using, see Determining
          the  version  .  To  update  existing  global  tables  from  version
          2017.11.29  (Legacy)  to  version 2019.11.21 (Current), see Updating
          global tables .

       If you want to add a new replica table to a global table, each  of  the
       following conditions must be true:

       o The  table  must have the same primary key as all of the other repli-
         cas.

       o The table must have the same name as all of the other replicas.

       o The table must have DynamoDB Streams enabled, with  the  stream  con-
         taining both the new and the old images of the item.

       o None of the replica tables in the global table can contain any data.

       If  global  secondary  indexes are specified, then the following condi-
       tions must also be met:

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same name.

       o The global secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort key
         (if present).

       If local secondary indexes are specified, then the following conditions
       must also be met:

       o The local secondary indexes must have the same name.

       o The local secondary indexes must have the same hash key and sort  key
         (if present).

       WARNING:
          Write  capacity  settings  should  be  set  consistently across your
          replica tables and secondary indexes. DynamoDB  strongly  recommends
          enabling  auto scaling to manage the write capacity settings for all
          of your global tables replicas and indexes.

          If you prefer to manage write capacity settings manually, you should
          provision  equal replicated write capacity units to your replica ta-
          bles. You should also  provision  equal  replicated  write  capacity
          units to matching secondary indexes across your global table.

OPTIONS
       --global-table-name (string)
          The global table name.

       --replication-group (list)
          The Regions where the global table needs to be created.

          (structure)
              Represents the properties of a replica.

              RegionName -> (string)
                 The Region where the replica needs to be created.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "RegionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a global table

       The  following  create-global-table example creates a global table from
       two identical tables in the specified, separate AWS Regions.

          aws dynamodb create-global-table \
              --global-table-name MusicCollection \
              --replication-group RegionName=us-east-2 RegionName=us-east-1 \
              --region us-east-2

       Output:

          {
              "GlobalTableDescription": {
                  "ReplicationGroup": [
                      {
                          "RegionName": "us-east-2"
                      },
                      {
                          "RegionName": "us-east-1"
                      }
                  ],

              The Regions where the global table has replicas.

              (structure)
                 Contains the details of the replica.

                 RegionName -> (string)
                     The name of the Region.

                 ReplicaStatus -> (string)
                     The current state of the replica:

                     o CREATING - The replica is being created.

                     o DELETING - The replica is being deleted.

                     o ACTIVE - The replica is ready for use.

                     o REGION_DISABLED  -  The replica is inaccessible because
                       the Amazon Web Services Region has been disabled.

                     NOTE:
                        If the Amazon Web Services Region remains inaccessible
                        for  more  than  20  hours,  DynamoDB will remove this
                        replica from the replication group. The  replica  will
                        not  be  deleted and replication will stop from and to
                        this region.

                     o INACCESSIBLE_ENCRYPTION_CREDENTIALS - The KMS key  used
                       to encrypt the table is inaccessible.

                     NOTE:
                        If  the  KMS key remains inaccessible for more than 20
                        hours, DynamoDB will  remove  this  replica  from  the
                        replication group. The replica will not be deleted and
                        replication will stop from and to this region.
