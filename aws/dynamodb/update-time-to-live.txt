UPDATE-TIME-TO-LIVE()                                    UPDATE-TIME-TO-LIVE()



NAME
       update-time-to-live -

DESCRIPTION
       The  UpdateTimeToLive method enables or disables Time to Live (TTL) for
       the specified table. A successful  UpdateTimeToLive  call  returns  the
       current  TimeToLiveSpecification  .  It can take up to one hour for the
       change to fully process. Any additional UpdateTimeToLive calls for  the
       same  table  during this one hour duration result in a ValidationExcep-
       tion .

       TTL compares the current time in epoch time format to the  time  stored
       in  the TTL attribute of an item. If the epoch time value stored in the
       attribute is less than the current time, the item is marked as  expired
       and subsequently deleted.

       NOTE:
          The  epoch  time  format  is  the  number  of  seconds elapsed since
          12:00:00 AM January 1, 1970 UTC.

       DynamoDB deletes expired items on a best-effort basis to ensure  avail-
       ability of throughput for other data operations.

       WARNING:
          DynamoDB  typically deletes expired items within two days of expira-
          tion. The exact duration within which an item gets deleted after ex-
          piration  is specific to the nature of the workload. Items that have
          expired and not been deleted will still show up in  reads,  queries,
          and scans.

       As  items  are deleted, they are removed from any local secondary index
       and global secondary index immediately in the same  eventually  consis-
       tent way as a standard delete operation.

       Guide.

SYNOPSIS
            update-time-to-live
          --table-name <value>
          --time-to-live-specification <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table to be configured.

       --time-to-live-specification (structure)
          Represents the settings used to enable or disable Time to  Live  for
          the specified table.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether  TTL  is  to  be  enabled  (true) or disabled
              (false) on the table.

          AttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the TTL attribute used to store the expiration  time
              for items in the table.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,AttributeName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "AttributeName": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update Time to Live settings on a table

       The  following  update-time-to-live example enables Time to Live on the
       specified table.

          aws dynamodb update-time-to-live \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --time-to-live-specification Enabled=true,AttributeName=ttl

       Output:

          {
              "TimeToLiveSpecification": {
                  "Enabled": true,
                  "AttributeName": "ttl"
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       TimeToLiveSpecification -> (structure)
          Represents the output of an UpdateTimeToLive operation.

          Enabled -> (boolean)

          AttributeName -> (string)
              The name of the TTL attribute used to store the expiration  time
