SCAN()                                                                  SCAN()



NAME
       scan -

DESCRIPTION
       The Scan operation returns one or more items and item attributes by ac-
       cessing every item in a table or a secondary index.  To  have  DynamoDB
       return fewer items, you can provide a FilterExpression operation.

       If  the  total number of scanned items exceeds the maximum dataset size
       limit of 1 MB, the scan stops and results are returned to the user as a
       LastEvaluatedKey  value to continue the scan in a subsequent operation.
       The results also include the number of items  exceeding  the  limit.  A
       scan can result in no table data meeting the filter criteria.

       A single Scan operation reads up to the maximum number of items set (if
       using the Limit parameter) or a maximum of 1 MB of data and then  apply
       any filtering to the results using FilterExpression . If LastEvaluated-
       Key is present in the response, you need to paginate  the  result  set.
       For more information, see Paginating the Results in the Amazon DynamoDB
       Developer Guide .
          Scan operations proceed sequentially; however,  for  faster  perfor-
          mance  on a large table or secondary index, applications can request
          a parallel Scan operation by providing the Segment and TotalSegments
          parameters.  For  more  information, see Parallel Scan in the Amazon
          DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          Scan uses eventually consistent reads when accessing the data  in  a
          table;  therefore,  the  result set might not include the changes to
          data in the table immediately before the  operation  began.  If  you
          need a consistent copy of the data, as of the time that the Scan be-
          gins, you can set the ConsistentRead parameter to true .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       scan is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in  or-
       der to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagina-
       tion by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text
       and  the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query argument
       must extract data from the results of the following query  expressions:
       Items, Count, ScannedCount

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  table containing the requested items; or, if you
          provide IndexName , the name of the table to which  that  index  be-
          longs.

       --index-name (string)
          The  name  of a secondary index to scan. This index can be any local
          secondary index or global secondary index. Note that if you use  the
          IndexName parameter, you must also provide TableName .

       --attributes-to-get (list)
          This  is  a  legacy parameter. Use ProjectionExpression instead. For
          more information, see AttributesToGet in the Amazon DynamoDB  Devel-
          oper Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --select (string)
          The  attributes  to  be returned in the result. You can retrieve all
          item attributes, specific item attributes,  the  count  of  matching
          items,  or  in  the  case of an index, some or all of the attributes
          projected into the index.

          o ALL_ATTRIBUTES - Returns all of the item attributes from the spec-
            ified  table  or index. If you query a local secondary index, then
            for each matching item in the index, DynamoDB fetches  the  entire
            item  from the parent table. If the index is configured to project
            all item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the
            local secondary index, and no fetching is required.

          o ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES  -  Allowed  only when querying an index.
            Retrieves all attributes that have been projected into the  index.
            If  the index is configured to project all attributes, this return
            value is equivalent to specifying ALL_ATTRIBUTES .

          o COUNT - Returns the number of  matching  items,  rather  than  the
            matching  items  themselves. Note that this uses the same quantity
            of read capacity units as getting the items, and is subject to the
            same item size calculations.

          o SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES  -  Returns only the attributes listed in Pro-
            jectionExpression . This return value is equivalent to  specifying
            ProjectionExpression  without specifying any value for Select . If
            you query or scan a local secondary index  and  request  only  at-
            tributes  that  are projected into that index, the operation reads
            only the index and not the table. If  any  of  the  requested  at-
            tributes  are  not  projected  into the local secondary index, Dy-
            namoDB fetches each of these attributes  from  the  parent  table.
            This extra fetching incurs additional throughput cost and latency.
            If you query or scan a global secondary index, you  can  only  re-
            quest  attributes  that  are projected into the index. Global sec-
            ondary index queries cannot fetch attributes from the  parent  ta-
            ble.

          If  neither  Select nor ProjectionExpression are specified, DynamoDB
          defaults to ALL_ATTRIBUTES when  accessing  a  table,  and  ALL_PRO-
          JECTED_ATTRIBUTES  when  accessing an index. You cannot use both Se-
          lect and ProjectionExpression together in a single  request,  unless
          the value for Select is SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES . (This usage is equiva-
          lent to specifying ProjectionExpression without any value for Select
          .)

          NOTE:
              If  you  use  the ProjectionExpression parameter, then the value
              for Select can only be SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES . Any other value for
              Select will return an error.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_ATTRIBUTES

          o ALL_PROJECTED_ATTRIBUTES

          o SPECIFIC_ATTRIBUTES

          o COUNT

       --scan-filter (map)
          This  is  a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more
          information, see ScanFilter in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the selection criteria for a Query or Scan operation:

              o For a Query operation, Condition is used  for  specifying  the
                KeyConditions  to  use  when querying a table or an index. For
                KeyConditions , only the following  comparison  operators  are
                supported:   EQ  |  LE  | LT | GE | GT | BEGINS_WITH | BETWEEN
                Condition is also used in a QueryFilter , which evaluates  the
                query results and returns only the desired values.

              o For  a  Scan  operation,  Condition  is used in a ScanFilter ,
                which evaluates the scan results and returns only the  desired
                values.

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One  or  more  values to evaluate against the supplied attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String  value  comparisons  for greater than, equals, or less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is  greater  than A , and a is greater than B . For a list of
                 code                       values,                        see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For Binary, DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary  data  as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                     namoDB Developer Guide .

                     S -> (string)
                        An attribute of type String. For example:
                            "S": "Hello"

                     N -> (string)
                        An attribute of type Number. For example:
                            "N": "123.45"

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                            "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                     SS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type String Set. For example:

                        (string)

                     NS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                            "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        (string)

                     BS -> (list)
                        An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                            "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                        (blob)

                     M -> (map)
                        An attribute of type Map. For example:
                            "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

                            B -> (blob)
                               An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                                   "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                            SS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                                   "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                               (string)

                            NS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                                   "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                               Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB
                               as strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across
                               languages   and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB
                               treats them as number type attributes for math-
                               ematical operations.

                               (string)

                            BS -> (list)
                               An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                                   "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                               (blob)

                            M -> (map)
                               An attribute of type Map. For example:
                                   "M":  {"Name":  {"S":  "Joe"}, "Age": {"N":
                                   "35"}}

                               key -> (string)

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            L -> (list)
                               An attribute of type List. For example:
                                   "L": [ {"S": "Cookies"} , {"S":  "Coffee"},
                                   {"N": "3.14159"}]

                               ( ... recursive ... )

                            NULL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Null. For example:
                                   "NULL": true

                            BOOL -> (boolean)
                               An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                                   "BOOL": true

                     NULL -> (boolean)
                        An attribute of type Null. For example:
                            "NULL": true

                     BOOL -> (boolean)
                        An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                            "BOOL": true

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A  comparator for evaluating attributes. For example, equals,
                 greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL |  CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ  :  Equal. EQ is supported for all data types, including
                   lists and maps.  AttributeValueList can  contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue  element  of  type  String,  Number, Binary,
                   String Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item  contains
                   an  AttributeValue element of a different type than the one
                   provided in the request, the value does not match. For  ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing  lists  and  maps.  AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue of type String, Number,  Binary,  String
                   Set,  Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue of a different type than the one  provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE  :  Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not a set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT  :  Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type).  If  an item contains an AttributeValue element of a
                   different type than the one provided in  the  request,  the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE  :  Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList can con-
                   tain only one AttributeValue element of type  String,  Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} .  Also,  {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT  :  Greater  than.   AttributeValueList can contain only
                   one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or  Bi-
                   nary  (not  a  set type). If an item contains an Attribute-
                   Value element of a different type than the one provided  in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also,  {"N":"6"}  does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL  : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the existence  of  an  attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result  is
                     a  Boolean true . This result is because the attribute "a
                     " exists; its data type is not relevant to  the  NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL  : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not  its data type. If the data type of attribute "a " is
                     null, and you evaluate it using NULL , the  result  is  a
                     Boolean  false  .  This is because the attribute "a " ex-
                     ists; its data type is not relevant to the NULL  compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS  :  Checks  for  a subsequence, or value in a set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the target attribute of the comparison is of  type  String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the input. If the target attribute of the comparison  is  a
                   set  ("SS  ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates
                   to true if it finds an exact match with any member  of  the
                   set.  CONTAINS  is  supported for lists: When evaluating "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS  : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or ab-
                   sence of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If the  target  attribute  of  the
                   comparison  is  a  String, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a substring match. If the  target  attribute  of
                   the  comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put.  If  the  target  attribute of the comparison is a set
                   ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates  to
                   true  if it does not find an exact match with any member of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing  "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain  only  one  AttributeValue of type String or Binary
                   (not a Number or a set type). The target attribute  of  the
                   comparison  must  be of type String or Binary (not a Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList  can  contain one or more AttributeValue elements of
                   type String, Number, or Binary. These attributes  are  com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN  :  Greater  than  or equal to the first value, and
                   less than or equal to  the  second  value.    AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type, either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type).  A
                   target  attribute  matches  if  the target value is greater
                   than, or equal to, the first  element  and  less  than,  or
                   equal  to,  the  second element. If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue element of a different type than the one  pro-
                   vided  in  the request, the value does not match. For exam-
                   ple, {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  .  Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

       --conditional-operator (string)
          This  is  a legacy parameter. Use FilterExpression instead. For more
          information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon  DynamoDB  Devel-
          oper Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the  operation,  together with ConsumedCapacity for each table and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return  ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL  - The response includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --total-segments (integer)
          For a parallel Scan request, TotalSegments represents the total num-
          ber  of  segments into which the Scan operation will be divided. The
          value of TotalSegments corresponds  to  the  number  of  application
          workers  that  will  perform  the parallel scan. For example, if you
          want to use four application threads to scan a table  or  an  index,
          specify a TotalSegments value of 4.

          The  value for TotalSegments must be greater than or equal to 1, and
          less than or equal to 1000000. If you specify a TotalSegments  value
          of 1, the Scan operation will be sequential rather than parallel.

          If you specify TotalSegments , you must also specify Segment .

       --segment (integer)
          For  a  parallel Scan request, Segment identifies an individual seg-
          ment to be scanned by an application worker.

          Segment IDs are zero-based, so the first segment is  always  0.  For
          example, if you want to use four application threads to scan a table
          or an index, then the first thread specifies a Segment value  of  0,
          the second thread specifies 1, and so on.

          The  value of LastEvaluatedKey returned from a parallel Scan request
          must be used as ExclusiveStartKey with the same segment ID in a sub-
          sequent Scan operation.

          The  value  for Segment must be greater than or equal to 0, and less
          than the value provided for TotalSegments .

          If you provide Segment , you must also provide TotalSegments .

       --projection-expression (string)
          A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the
          specified  table  or  index.  These  attributes can include scalars,
          sets, or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the  expres-
          sion must be separated by commas.

          If no attribute names are specified, then all attributes will be re-
          turned. If any of the requested attributes are not found, they  will
          not appear in the result.

          For  more  information, see Specifying Item Attributes in the Amazon
          DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --filter-expression (string)
          A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB  applies  after  the
          Scan  operation,  but before the data is returned to you. Items that
          do not satisfy the FilterExpression criteria are not returned.

          NOTE:
              A FilterExpression is applied after the items have already  been
              read;  the  process of filtering does not consume any additional
              read capacity units.

          For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon  DynamoDB
          Developer Guide .

       --expression-attribute-names (map)
          One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in an expres-
          sion. The following are  some  use  cases  for  using  ExpressionAt-
          tributeNames :

          o To  access  an  attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB re-
            served word.

          o To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an  attribute
            name in an expression.

          o To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being mis-
            interpreted in an expression.

          Use the # character in an expression  to  dereference  an  attribute
          name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

          o Percentile

          The  name  of  this  attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
          cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list  of
          reserved  words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide ). To work around this, you could specify  the  following  for
          ExpressionAttributeNames :

          o {"#P":"Percentile"}

          You  could  then  use this substitution in an expression, as in this
          example:

          o #P = :val

          NOTE:
              Tokens that begin with the : character are expression  attribute
              values , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

          For  more  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying
          Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expression-attribute-values (map)
          One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

          Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference  an  at-
          tribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
          the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:
              Available | Backordered | Discontinued

          You would first need to specify  ExpressionAttributeValues  as  fol-
          lows:
              {    ":avail":{"S":"Available"},    ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
              ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }

          You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
              ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)

          For more information on expression attribute values,  see  Condition
          Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

       --consistent-read | --no-consistent-read (boolean)
          A Boolean value that determines the read  consistency  model  during
          the scan:

          o If  ConsistentRead  is  false  ,  then the data returned from Scan
            might not contain the results from other recently completed  write
            operations (PutItem , UpdateItem , or DeleteItem ).

          o If  ConsistentRead is true , then all of the write operations that
            completed before the Scan began are guaranteed to be contained  in
            the Scan response.

          The default setting for ConsistentRead is false .

          The  ConsistentRead  parameter  is not supported on global secondary
          indexes. If you scan a global secondary  index  with  ConsistentRead
          set to true, you will receive a ValidationException .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To scan a table

       The following scan example scans the entire MusicCollection table,  and
       then  narrows the results to songs by the artist "No One You Know". For
       each item, only the album title and song title are returned.

          aws dynamodb scan \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --filter-expression "Artist = :a" \
              --projection-expression "#ST, #AT" \
              --expression-attribute-names file://expression-attribute-names.json \
              --expression-attribute-values file://expression-attribute-values.json

       Contents of expression-attribute-names.json:

          {
              "#ST": "SongTitle",
              "#AT":"AlbumTitle"
          }

       Contents of expression-attribute-values.json:

          {
              ":a": {"S": "No One You Know"}
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Count": 2,
              "Items": [
                  {

                      }
                  },
                  {

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          An  array of item attributes that match the scan criteria. Each ele-
          ment in this array consists of an attribute name and the  value  for
          that attribute.

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair. The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 For more information, see Data Types in the  Amazon  DynamoDB
                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:

                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:
                        "NULL": true

                 BOOL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

       Count -> (integer)
          The number of items in the response.

          If you set ScanFilter in the request, then Count is  the  number  of
          items returned after the filter was applied, and ScannedCount is the
          number of matching items before the filter was applied.

          If you did not use a filter in the request, then Count is  the  same
          as ScannedCount .

       ScannedCount -> (integer)
          The  number  of items evaluated, before any ScanFilter is applied. A
          high ScannedCount value with few, or no, Count results indicates  an
          inefficient  Scan  operation.  For  more  information, see Count and
          ScannedCount in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          If you did not use a filter in the request, then ScannedCount is the
          same as Count .

       LastEvaluatedKey -> (map)
          The  primary  key of the item where the operation stopped, inclusive
          of the previous result set. Use this value to start a new operation,
          excluding this value in the new request.

          If  LastEvaluatedKey  is  empty, then the "last page" of results has
          been processed and there is no more data to be retrieved.

          If LastEvaluatedKey is not empty, it does not necessarily mean  that
          there  is more data in the result set. The only way to know when you
          have reached the end of the result set is when  LastEvaluatedKey  is
          empty.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
