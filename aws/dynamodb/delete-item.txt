DELETE-ITEM()                                                    DELETE-ITEM()



NAME
       delete-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a single item in a table by primary key. You can perform a con-
       ditional delete operation that deletes the item if it exists, or if  it
       has an expected attribute value.

       In  addition to deleting an item, you can also return the item's attri-
       bute values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter.

       Unless you specify conditions, the DeleteItem is an  idempotent  opera-
       tion;  running it multiple times on the same item or attribute does not
       result in an error response.

       Conditional deletes are useful for deleting items only if specific con-
       ditions  are  met.  If  those conditions are met, DynamoDB performs the
       delete. Otherwise, the item is not deleted.

OPTIONS
       --table-name (string)
          The name of the table from which to delete the item.  You  can  also
          provide  the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the table in this parame-
          ter.

       --key (map)
          A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, representing the
          primary key of the item to delete.

          For the primary key, you must provide all of the key attributes. For
          example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value
          for the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide
          values for both the partition key and the sort key.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For  more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:
                     "S": "Hello"

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                     "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                     "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

       --expected (map)
          This  is  a  legacy  parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
          more information, see Expected  in  the  Amazon  DynamoDB  Developer
          Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents  a  condition to be compared with an attribute value.
              This condition can be used with DeleteItem , PutItem  ,  or  Up-
              dateItem  operations;  if  the comparison evaluates to true, the
              operation succeeds; if not, the operation fails. You can use Ex-
              pectedAttributeValue in one of two different ways:

              o Use  AttributeValueList  to specify one or more values to com-
                pare against an attribute. Use ComparisonOperator  to  specify
                how  you  want  to  perform  the comparison. If the comparison
                evaluates to true, then the conditional operation succeeds.

              o Use Value to  specify  a  value  that  DynamoDB  will  compare
                against  an  attribute.  If the values match, then ExpectedAt-
                tributeValue evaluates to true and the  conditional  operation
                succeeds.  Optionally, you can also set Exists to false, indi-
                cating that you do not expect to find the attribute  value  in
                the  table.  In  this case, the conditional operation succeeds
                only if the comparison evaluates to false.
                 Value and Exists are incompatible with AttributeValueList and
                 ComparisonOperator . Note that if you use both sets of param-
                 eters at once, DynamoDB will return a ValidationException ex-
                 ception.

              Value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for the expected attribute.

                 Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair. The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 Developer Guide .

                 S -> (string)
                     An attribute of type String. For example:
                        "S": "Hello"

                 N -> (string)
                     An attribute of type Number. For example:
                        "N": "123.45"

                     Numbers  are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB as
                     strings, to maximize compatibility across  languages  and
                     libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats them as number type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                 B -> (blob)
                     An attribute of type Binary. For example:
                        "B": "dGhpcyB0ZXh0IGlzIGJhc2U2NC1lbmNvZGVk"

                 SS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                        "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                     (string)

                 NS -> (list)
                     An attribute of type Number Set. For example:
                        "NS": ["42.2", "-19", "7.5", "3.14"]

                     Numbers are  sent  across  the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                     strings,  to  maximize compatibility across languages and
                     libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as  number  type
                     attributes for mathematical operations.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

                            (string)

                               {"N": "3.14159"}]

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                        BOOL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                               "BOOL": true

                 NULL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Null. For example:
                        "NULL": true

                 BOOL -> (boolean)
                     An attribute of type Boolean. For example:
                        "BOOL": true

              Exists -> (boolean)
                 Causes DynamoDB to evaluate the  value  before  attempting  a
                 conditional operation:

                 o If  Exists is true , DynamoDB will check to see if that at-
                   tribute value already exists in the table. If it is  found,
                   then the operation succeeds. If it is not found, the opera-
                   tion fails with a ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 o If Exists is false , DynamoDB assumes  that  the  attribute
                   value  does  not  exist  in the table. If in fact the value
                   does not exist, then the assumption is valid and the opera-
                   tion  succeeds.  If the value is found, despite the assump-
                   tion that it does not exist, the  operation  fails  with  a
                   ConditionCheckFailedException .

                 The  default  setting  for  Exists  is true . If you supply a
                 Value all by itself, DynamoDB assumes the  attribute  exists:
                 You don't have to set Exists to true , because it is implied.

                 DynamoDB returns a ValidationException if:

                 o Exists  is true but there is no Value to check. (You expect
                   a value to exist, but don't specify what that value is.)

                 o Exists is false but you also provide a Value . (You  cannot
                   expect  an  attribute to have a value, while also expecting
                   it not to exist.)

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 A comparator for evaluating attributes in  the  AttributeVal-
                 ueList . For example, equals, greater than, less than, etc.

                 The following comparison operators are available:
                     EQ  | NE | LE | LT | GE | GT | NOT_NULL | NULL | CONTAINS
                     | NOT_CONTAINS | BEGINS_WITH | IN | BETWEEN

                 The following are descriptions of each comparison operator.

                 o EQ : Equal. EQ is supported for all data  types,  including
                   lists  and  maps.   AttributeValueList can contain only one
                   AttributeValue element  of  type  String,  Number,  Binary,
                   String  Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains
                   an AttributeValue element of a different type than the  one
                   provided  in the request, the value does not match. For ex-
                   ample, {"S":"6"} does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NE : Not equal. NE is supported for all data types, includ-
                   ing lists and maps.  AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  of type String, Number, Binary, String
                   Set, Number Set, or Binary Set. If an item contains an  At-
                   tributeValue  of  a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not equal {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LE : Less than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  contain
                   only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Number, or
                   Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o LT : Less than.   AttributeValueList can contain  only  one
                   AttributeValue of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set
                   type). If an item contains an AttributeValue element  of  a
                   different  type  than  the one provided in the request, the
                   value does not match. For example, {"S":"6"} does not equal
                   {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6",
                   "2", "1"]} .

                 o GE : Greater than or equal.   AttributeValueList  can  con-
                   tain  only  one AttributeValue element of type String, Num-
                   ber, or Binary (not a set type). If an item contains an At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"}
                   does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o GT : Greater than.   AttributeValueList  can  contain  only
                   one  AttributeValue  element of type String, Number, or Bi-
                   nary (not a set type). If an item  contains  an  Attribute-
                   Value  element of a different type than the one provided in
                   the  request,  the  value  does  not  match.  For  example,
                   {"S":"6"}  does  not equal {"N":"6"} . Also, {"N":"6"} does
                   not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]} .

                 o NOT_NULL : The attribute exists. NOT_NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This  operator  tests  for the existence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and you evaluate it using NOT_NULL , the result is
                     a Boolean true . This result is because the attribute  "a
                     "  exists;  its data type is not relevant to the NOT_NULL
                     comparison operator.

                 o NULL : The attribute does not exist. NULL is supported  for
                   all data types, including lists and maps.

                 NOTE:
                     This operator tests for the nonexistence of an attribute,
                     not its data type. If the data type of attribute "a "  is
                     null,  and  you  evaluate it using NULL , the result is a
                     Boolean false . This is because the attribute  "a  "  ex-
                     ists;  its data type is not relevant to the NULL compari-
                     son operator.

                 o CONTAINS : Checks for a subsequence, or  value  in  a  set.
                   AttributeValueList can contain only one AttributeValue ele-
                   ment of type String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). If
                   the  target  attribute of the comparison is of type String,
                   then the operator checks for a substring match. If the tar-
                   get attribute of the comparison is of type Binary, then the
                   operator looks for a subsequence of the target that matches
                   the  input.  If the target attribute of the comparison is a
                   set ("SS ", "NS ", or "BS "), then the  operator  evaluates
                   to  true  if it finds an exact match with any member of the
                   set. CONTAINS is supported for lists:  When  evaluating  "a
                   CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b " cannot be a
                   set, a map, or a list.

                 o NOT_CONTAINS : Checks for absence of a subsequence, or  ab-
                   sence  of a value in a set.  AttributeValueList can contain
                   only one AttributeValue element of type String, Number,  or
                   Binary  (not  a  set  type). If the target attribute of the
                   comparison is a String, then the operator  checks  for  the
                   absence  of  a  substring match. If the target attribute of
                   the comparison is Binary, then the operator checks for  the
                   absence of a subsequence of the target that matches the in-
                   put. If the target attribute of the  comparison  is  a  set
                   ("SS  ",  "NS  ", or "BS "), then the operator evaluates to
                   true if it does not find an exact match with any member  of
                   the set. NOT_CONTAINS is supported for lists: When evaluat-
                   ing "a NOT CONTAINS b ", "a " can be a list; however, "b  "
                   cannot be a set, a map, or a list.

                 o BEGINS_WITH : Checks for a prefix.   AttributeValueList can
                   contain only one AttributeValue of type  String  or  Binary
                   (not  a  Number or a set type). The target attribute of the
                   comparison must be of type String or Binary (not  a  Number
                   or a set type).

                 o IN : Checks for matching elements in a list.  AttributeVal-
                   ueList can contain one or more AttributeValue  elements  of
                   type  String,  Number, or Binary. These attributes are com-
                   pared against an existing attribute of an item. If any ele-
                   ments of the input are equal to the item attribute, the ex-
                   pression evaluates to true.

                 o BETWEEN : Greater than or equal to  the  first  value,  and
                   less  than  or  equal  to the second value.   AttributeVal-
                   ueList must contain two AttributeValue elements of the same
                   type,  either String, Number, or Binary (not a set type). A
                   target attribute matches if the  target  value  is  greater
                   than,  or  equal  to,  the  first element and less than, or
                   equal to, the second element. If an item  contains  an  At-
                   tributeValue  element of a different type than the one pro-
                   vided in the request, the value does not match.  For  exam-
                   ple,  {"S":"6"}  does  not  compare  to  {"N":"6"}  . Also,
                   {"N":"6"} does not compare to {"NS":["6", "2", "1"]}

              AttributeValueList -> (list)
                 One or more values to evaluate against  the  supplied  attri-
                 bute. The number of values in the list depends on the Compar-
                 isonOperator being used.

                 For type Number, value comparisons are numeric.

                 String value comparisons for greater than,  equals,  or  less
                 than are based on ASCII character code values. For example, a
                 is greater than A , and a is greater than B . For a  list  of
                 code                        values,                       see
                 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_printable_characters
                 .

                 For  Binary,  DynamoDB treats each byte of the binary data as
                 unsigned when it compares binary values.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                        Numbers are sent across the  network  to  DynamoDB  as
                        strings,  to  maximize  compatibility across languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                     B -> (blob)
                        An attribute of type Binary. For example:

                        Numbers  are  sent  across  the network to DynamoDB as
                        strings, to maximize  compatibility  across  languages
                        and libraries. However, DynamoDB treats them as number
                        type attributes for mathematical operations.

                        key -> (string)

                        value -> (structure)
                            Represents the data for an attribute.

                            Each attribute value is described as a  name-value
                            pair.  The name is the data type, and the value is
                            the data itself.

       --conditional-operator (string)
          This  is  a  legacy  parameter. Use ConditionExpression instead. For
          more information, see ConditionalOperator in the Amazon DynamoDB De-
          veloper Guide .

          Possible values:

          o AND

          o OR

       --return-values (string)
          Use  ReturnValues if you want to get the item attributes as they ap-
          peared before they were deleted. For DeleteItem , the  valid  values
          are:

          o NONE - If ReturnValues is not specified, or if its value is NONE ,
            then nothing is returned. (This setting is the default for Return-
            Values .)

          o ALL_OLD - The content of the old item is returned.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          NOTE:
              The  ReturnValues  parameter  is used by several DynamoDB opera-
              tions; however, DeleteItem does not recognize any  values  other
              than NONE or ALL_OLD .

          Possible values:

          o NONE

          o ALL_OLD

          o UPDATED_OLD

          o ALL_NEW

          o UPDATED_NEW

       --return-consumed-capacity (string)
          Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand
          throughput consumption that is returned in the response:

          o INDEXES - The response includes the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for
            the  operation,  together with ConsumedCapacity for each table and
            secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such
            as GetItem and BatchGetItem , do not access any indexes at all. In
            these cases, specifying INDEXES will only return  ConsumedCapacity
            information for table(s).

          o TOTAL  - The response includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity
            for the operation.

          o NONE - No ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.

          Possible values:

          o INDEXES

          o TOTAL

          o NONE

       --return-item-collection-metrics (string)
          Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If  set  to
          SIZE  ,  the response includes statistics about item collections, if
          any, that were modified during the operation are returned in the re-
          sponse. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are returned.

          Possible values:

          o SIZE

          o NONE

       --condition-expression (string)
          A  condition  that  must  be  satisfied  in  order for a conditional
          DeleteItem to succeed.

          An expression can contain any of the following:

          o Functions:  attribute_exists  |  attribute_not_exists   |   attri-
            bute_type  |  contains | begins_with | size   These function names
            are case-sensitive.

          o Comparison operators: = | <> | < | > | <= | >= | BETWEEN | IN

          o Logical operators: AND | OR | NOT

          For more information about condition expressions, see Condition  Ex-
          pressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

       --expression-attribute-names (map)
          One  or  more  substitution tokens for attribute names in an expres-
          sion. The following are  some  use  cases  for  using  ExpressionAt-
          tributeNames :

          o To  access  an  attribute whose name conflicts with a DynamoDB re-
            served word.

          o To create a placeholder for repeating occurrences of an  attribute
            name in an expression.

          o To prevent special characters in an attribute name from being mis-
            interpreted in an expression.

          Use the # character in an expression  to  dereference  an  attribute
          name. For example, consider the following attribute name:

          o Percentile

          The  name  of  this  attribute conflicts with a reserved word, so it
          cannot be used directly in an expression. (For the complete list  of
          reserved  words, see Reserved Words in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer
          Guide ). To work around this, you could specify  the  following  for
          ExpressionAttributeNames :

          o {"#P":"Percentile"}

          You  could  then  use this substitution in an expression, as in this
          example:

          o #P = :val

          NOTE:
              Tokens that begin with the : character are expression  attribute
              values , which are placeholders for the actual value at runtime.

          For  more  information on expression attribute names, see Specifying
          Item Attributes in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --expression-attribute-values (map)
          One or more values that can be substituted in an expression.

          Use the : (colon) character in an expression to dereference  an  at-
          tribute value. For example, suppose that you wanted to check whether
          the value of the ProductStatus attribute was one of the following:
              Available | Backordered | Discontinued

          You would first need to specify  ExpressionAttributeValues  as  fol-
          lows:
              {    ":avail":{"S":"Available"},    ":back":{"S":"Backordered"},
              ":disc":{"S":"Discontinued"} }

          You could then use these values in an expression, such as this:
              ProductStatus IN (:avail, :back, :disc)

          For more information on expression attribute values,  see  Condition
          Expressions in the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

              For more information, see Data Types in the Amazon DynamoDB  De-
              veloper Guide .

              S -> (string)
                 An attribute of type String. For example:

              N -> (string)
                 An attribute of type Number. For example:
                     "N": "123.45"

                 Numbers  are  sent across the network to DynamoDB as strings,
                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:

              SS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type String Set. For example:
                     "SS": ["Giraffe", "Hippo" ,"Zebra"]

                 (string)

              NS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Number Set. For example:

                 Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB  as  strings,
                 to  maximize  compatibility  across  languages and libraries.
                 However, DynamoDB treats them as number type  attributes  for
                 mathematical operations.

                 (string)

              BS -> (list)
                 An attribute of type Binary Set. For example:
                     "BS": ["U3Vubnk=", "UmFpbnk=", "U25vd3k="]

                 (blob)

              M -> (map)
                 An attribute of type Map. For example:
                     "M": {"Name": {"S": "Joe"}, "Age": {"N": "35"}}

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each  attribute  value is described as a name-value pair.
                     The name is the data type, and the value is the data  it-
                     self.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the data for an attribute.

                     Each attribute value is described as a  name-value  pair.
                     The  name is the data type, and the value is the data it-
                     self.

       --return-values-on-condition-check-failure (string)
          An optional  parameter  that  returns  the  item  attributes  for  a
          DeleteItem operation that failed a condition check.

          There  is  no  additional  cost  associated with requesting a return
          value aside from the small network and processing  overhead  of  re-
          ceiving a larger response. No read capacity units are consumed.

          Possible values:

          o ALL_OLD

          o NONE

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To delete an item

       The following delete-item example deletes an item from the MusicCollec-
       tion table and requests details about the item that was deleted and the
       capacity used by the request.

          aws dynamodb delete-item \
              --table-name MusicCollection \
              --key file://key.json \
              --return-values ALL_OLD \
              --return-consumed-capacity TOTAL \
              --return-item-collection-metrics SIZE

       Example 2: To delete an item conditionally

       The following example deletes an item  from  the  ProductCatalog  table
       only  if its ProductCategory is either Sporting Goods or Gardening Sup-
       plies and its price is between 500 and 600. It  returns  details  about
       the item that was deleted.

OUTPUT
       Attributes -> (map)
          A map of attribute names to AttributeValue objects, representing the
          item  as  it  appeared before the DeleteItem operation. This map ap-
          pears in the response only if ReturnValues was specified as  ALL_OLD
          in the request.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the data for an attribute.

              Each attribute value is described as a name-value pair. The name
              is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                 to maximize compatibility  across  languages  and  libraries.
                 However,  DynamoDB  treats them as number type attributes for
                 mathematical operations.

              B -> (blob)
                 An attribute of type Binary. For example:

       ItemCollectionMetrics -> (structure)
          Information  about  item  collections, if any, that were affected by
          the DeleteItem operation. ItemCollectionMetrics is only returned  if
          the  ReturnItemCollectionMetrics parameter was specified. If the ta-
          ble does not have any local secondary indexes, this  information  is
          not returned in the response.

          Each ItemCollectionMetrics element consists of:

          o ItemCollectionKey  -  The  partition key value of the item collec-
            tion. This is the same as the partition key value of the item  it-
            self.

          o SizeEstimateRangeGB  - An estimate of item collection size, in gi-
            gabytes. This value is a  two-element  array  containing  a  lower
            bound  and  an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes
            the size of all the items in the table, plus the size of  all  at-
            tributes projected into all of the local secondary indexes on that
            table. Use this estimate to measure whether a local secondary  in-
            dex  is  approaching  its  size  limit. The estimate is subject to
            change over time; therefore, do not rely on the precision or accu-
            racy of the estimate.

          ItemCollectionKey -> (map)
              The  partition  key  value of the item collection. This value is
              the same as the partition key value of the item.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)
                 Represents the data for an attribute.

                 Each attribute value is described as a name-value  pair.  The
                 name is the data type, and the value is the data itself.

                            Numbers are sent across the network to DynamoDB as
                            strings, to  maximize  compatibility  across  lan-
                            guages  and  libraries.  However,  DynamoDB treats
                            them as number type  attributes  for  mathematical
                            operations.

                        NULL -> (boolean)
                            An attribute of type Null. For example:
                               "NULL": true

                 L -> (list)
                     An attribute of type List. For example:
                        "L": [  {"S":  "Cookies"}  ,  {"S":  "Coffee"},  {"N":
                        "3.14159"}]

                     (structure)
                        Represents the data for an attribute.

                        Each  attribute  value  is  described  as a name-value
                        pair. The name is the data type, and the value is  the
                        data itself.

          SizeEstimateRangeGB -> (list)
              An estimate of item collection size, in gigabytes. This value is
              a two-element array containing a lower bound and an upper  bound
              for  the  estimate.  The  estimate  includes the size of all the
              items in the table, plus the size of  all  attributes  projected
              into  all of the local secondary indexes on that table. Use this
              estimate to measure whether a local secondary index is approach-
              ing its size limit.

              The  estimate  is subject to change over time; therefore, do not
              rely on the precision or accuracy of the estimate.
