       o States

       o Events

       o Actions

       o Capabilities

       o Mappings

       o Devices

       o Device Models

       o Services

       This  action doesn't return definitions for systems, flows, and deploy-
       ments.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-entities
          --ids <value>
          [--namespace-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ids (list)
          An array of entity IDs.

          The IDs should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:device:DEVICENAME

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --namespace-version (long)
          The version of the user's namespace. Defaults to the latest  version
          of the user's namespace.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get definitions for entities

       The following get-entities example  gets  a  definition  for  a  device
       model.

          aws iotthingsgraph get-entities \
              --ids "urn:tdm:aws/examples:DeviceModel:MotionSensor"

       Output:

          {
              "descriptions": [
                  {
                      "id": "urn:tdm:aws/examples:DeviceModel:MotionSensor",
                      "type": "DEVICE_MODEL",
                      "createdAt": 1559256190.599,
                      "definition": {
                          "language": "GRAPHQL",
                          "text": "##\n# Specification of motion sensor devices interface.\n##\ntype MotionSensor @deviceModel(id: \"urn:tdm:aws/examples:deviceModel:MotionSensor\",\n        capability: \"urn:tdm:aws/examples:capability:MotionSensorCapability\") {ignore:void}"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }
