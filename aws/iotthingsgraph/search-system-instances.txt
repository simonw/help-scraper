SEARCH-SYSTEM-INSTANCES()                            SEARCH-SYSTEM-INSTANCES()



NAME
       search-system-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for system instances in the user's account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-system-instances  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: summaries

SYNOPSIS
            search-system-instances
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Optional filter to apply to  the  search.  Valid  filters  are  SYS-
          TEM_TEMPLATE_ID , STATUS , and GREENGRASS_GROUP_NAME .

          Multiple filters function as OR criteria in the query. Multiple val-
          ues passed inside the filter function as AND criteria.

          (structure)
              An object that filters a system instance search.  Multiple  fil-
              ters function as OR criteria in the search. For example a search
              that  includes  a  GREENGRASS_GROUP_NAME  and  a  STATUS  filter
              searches  for system instances in the specified Greengrass group
              that have the specified status.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the search filter field.

              value -> (list)
                 An array of string values for the search filter field. Multi-
                 ple values function as AND criteria in the search.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "SYSTEM_TEMPLATE_ID"|"STATUS"|"GREENGRASS_GROUP_NAME",
              "value": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for system instances

       The following search-system-instances example searches for  all  system
       instances that contain the specified system.

          aws iotthingsgraph search-system-instances \
              --filters name="SYSTEM_TEMPLATE_ID",value="urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:System:SecurityFlow"

       Output:
