GET-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE-REVISIONS()                GET-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE-REVISIONS()



NAME
       get-system-template-revisions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets revisions made to the specified system template. Only the previous
       100 revisions are stored. If the system has been deprecated,  this  ac-
       tion  will  return  the revisions that occurred before its deprecation.
       This action won't work with systems that have been deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-system-template-revisions is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: summaries

SYNOPSIS
            get-system-template-revisions
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the system template.

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:system:SYSTEMNAME

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get revision information about a system

       The  following  get-system-template-revisions example gets revision in-
       formation about a system.

          aws iotthingsgraph get-system-template-revisions \
              --id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:System:MySystem"

       Output:

          {
              "summaries": [
                  {
                      "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:System:MySystem",
                      "arn": "arn:aws:iotthingsgraph:us-west-2:123456789012:System/default/MySystem",
                      "revisionNumber": 1,
                      "createdAt": 1559247540.656
                  }
              ]
          }
