SEARCH-ENTITIES()                                            SEARCH-ENTITIES()



NAME
       search-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches  for  entities of the specified type. You can search for enti-
       ties in your namespace and the public namespace that you're tracking.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-entities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: descriptions

SYNOPSIS
            search-entities
          --entity-types <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--namespace-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --entity-types (list)
          The entity types for which to search.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            DEVICE
            SERVICE
            DEVICE_MODEL
            CAPABILITY
            STATE
            ACTION
            EVENT
            PROPERTY
            MAPPING
            ENUM

       --filters (list)
          Optional  filter  to  apply  to  the  search. Valid filters are NAME
          NAMESPACE , SEMANTIC_TYPE_PATH  and  REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID  .  REFER-
          ENCED_ENTITY_ID  filters  on entities that are used by the entity in
          the result set. For example, you can filter on the ID of a  property
          that is used in a state.

          Multiple filters function as OR criteria in the query. Multiple val-
          ues passed inside the filter function as AND criteria.

          (structure)
              An object that filters an entity search. Multiple filters  func-
              tion as OR criteria in the search. For example a search that in-
              cludes a NAMESPACE and a  REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID  filter  searches
              for  entities  in  the  specified  namespace that use the entity
              specified by the value of REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the entity search  filter  field.  REFERENCED_EN-
                 TITY_ID  filters  on  entities that are used by the entity in
                 the result set. For example, you can filter on the  ID  of  a
                 property that is used in a state.

              value -> (list)
                 An array of string values for the search filter field. Multi-
                 ple values function as AND criteria in the search.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "NAME"|"NAMESPACE"|"SEMANTIC_TYPE_PATH"|"REFERENCED_ENTITY_ID",
              "value": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --namespace-version (long)
          The version of the user's namespace. Defaults to the latest  version
          of the user's namespace.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following search-entities example searches for all entities of type
       EVENT.
