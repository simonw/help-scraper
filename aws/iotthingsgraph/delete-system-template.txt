DELETE-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE()                              DELETE-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       delete-system-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  system.  New deployments can't contain the system after its
       deletion. Existing deployments that contain the system will continue to
       work because they use a snapshot of the system that is taken when it is
       deployed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-system-template
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the system to be deleted.

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:system:SYSTEMNAME

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
