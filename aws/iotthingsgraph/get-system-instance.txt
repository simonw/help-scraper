GET-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()                                    GET-SYSTEM-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-system-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a system instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-system-instance
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  ID of the system deployment instance. This value is returned by
          CreateSystemInstance .

          The ID should be in the following format.
              urn:tdm:REGION/ACCOUNT ID/default:deployment:DEPLOYMENTNAME

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a system instance

       The  following get-system-instance example gets a definition for a sys-
       tem instance.

          aws iotthingsgraph get-system-instance \
              --id "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Deployment:Room218"
