SEARCH-FLOW-TEMPLATES()                                SEARCH-FLOW-TEMPLATES()



NAME
       search-flow-templates -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for summary information about workflows.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-flow-templates  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: summaries

SYNOPSIS
            search-flow-templates
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          An array of objects that limit the result set. The only valid filter
          is DEVICE_MODEL_ID .

          (structure)
              An object that filters a workflow search.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the search filter field.

              value -> (list)
                 An array of string values for the search filter field. Multi-
                 ple values function as AND criteria in the search.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "DEVICE_MODEL_ID",
              "value": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To search for flows (or workflows)

       The  following  search-flow-templates  example  searches  for all flows
       (workflows) that contain the Camera device model.

          aws iotthingsgraph search-flow-templates \
              --filters name="DEVICE_MODEL_ID",value="urn:tdm:aws/examples:DeviceModel:Camera"

       Output:

          {
              "summaries": [
                  {
                      "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Workflow:MyFlow",
                      "revisionNumber": 1,
                      "createdAt": 1559247540.292
                  },
                  {
                      "id": "urn:tdm:us-west-2/123456789012/default:Workflow:SecurityFlow",
                      "revisionNumber": 3,
                      "createdAt": 1548283099.27
                  }
              ]
          }
