SYNOPSIS
            update-rule
          --identifier <value>
          [--retention-period <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--resource-type <value>]
          [--resource-tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identifier (string)
          The unique ID of the retention rule to update.

       --retention-period (structure)
          Information about the retention period for which the retention  rule
          is to retain resources.

          RetentionPeriodValue -> (integer)
              The  period  value for which the retention rule is to retain re-
              sources. The period is measured using the unit specified for Re-
              tentionPeriodUnit .

          RetentionPeriodUnit -> (string)
              The unit of time in which the retention period is measured. Cur-
              rently, only DAYS is supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RetentionPeriodValue=integer,RetentionPeriodUnit=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RetentionPeriodValue": integer,
            "RetentionPeriodUnit": "DAYS"
          }

       --description (string)
          The retention rule description.

       --resource-type (string)
          The resource type to be retained by the retention  rule.  Currently,
          only Amazon EBS snapshots are supported.

          Possible values:

          o EBS_SNAPSHOT

       --resource-tags (list)
          Information  about  the  resource  tags to use to identify resources
          that are to be retained by the retention rule.  The  retention  rule
          retains  only  deleted snapshots that have one or more of the speci-
          fied tag key and value pairs. If a snapshot is deleted, but it  does
          not have any of the specified tag key and value pairs, it is immedi-
          ately deleted without being retained by the retention rule.

          You can add the same tag key and value pair to a maximum or five re-
          tention rules.

          (structure)
              Information about a resource tag used to identify resources that
              are to be retained by a Recycle Bin retention rule.

              ResourceTagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              ResourceTagValue -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceTagKey=string,ResourceTagValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceTagKey": "string",
              "ResourceTagValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              tentionPeriodUnit .
