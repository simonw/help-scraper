SIGNAL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()                        SIGNAL-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()



NAME
       signal-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Records  a  WorkflowExecutionSignaled  event  in the workflow execution
       history and creates a decision task for the workflow execution  identi-
       fied  by  the given domain, workflowId and runId. The event is recorded
       with the specified user defined signalName and input (if provided).

       NOTE:
          If a runId isn't specified, then the WorkflowExecutionSignaled event
          is  recorded  in  the  history of the current open workflow with the
          matching workflowId in the domain.

       NOTE:
              If the specified workflow  execution  isn't  open,  this  method
              fails with UnknownResource .

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set  to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED  .  For  details  and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            signal-workflow-execution
          --domain <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--run-id <value>]
          --signal-name <value>
          [--input <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the workflow execution to signal.

       --workflow-id (string)
          The workflowId of the workflow execution to signal.

       --run-id (string)
          The runId of the workflow execution to signal.

       --signal-name (string)
          The  name  of the signal. This name must be meaningful to the target
          workflow.

       --input (string)
          Data to attach to the WorkflowExecutionSignaled event in the  target
          workflow execution's history.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
