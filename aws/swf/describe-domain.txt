DESCRIBE-DOMAIN()                                            DESCRIBE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       describe-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the specified domain, including description
       and status.
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-domain
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the domain to describe.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
   Getting Information About a Domain
       To get detailed information about a particular domain, use the swf  de-
       scribe-domain  command.  There is one required parameter: --name, which
       takes the name of the domain you want information about. For example:

          $ aws swf describe-domain --name DataFrobotz
          {
              "domainInfo": {
                  "status": "REGISTERED",
                  "name": "DataFrobotz"
              },
              "configuration": {
                  "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "1"
              }
          }

       You can also use describe-domain to get  information  about  deprecated
       domains:

          $ aws swf describe-domain --name MyNeatNewDomain
          {
              "domainInfo": {
                  "status": "DEPRECATED",
                  "name": "MyNeatNewDomain"
              },
              "configuration": {
                  "workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays": "0"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       domainInfo -> (structure)
          The  basic information about a domain, such as its name, status, and
          description.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the domain. This name is unique within the account.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the domain:

              o REGISTERED  The domain is properly registered  and  available.
                You can use this domain for registering types and creating new
                workflow executions.

              o DEPRECATED  The domain was deprecated using  DeprecateDomain ,
                but is still in use. You should not create new workflow execu-
                tions in this domain.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the domain provided through  RegisterDomain .

          arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the domain.

       configuration -> (structure)
          The domain configuration. Currently, this includes only the domain's
          retention period.

          workflowExecutionRetentionPeriodInDays -> (string)
              The retention period for workflow executions in this domain.
