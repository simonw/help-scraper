START-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()                          START-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()



NAME
       start-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  an execution of the workflow type in the specified domain using
       the provided workflowId and input data.

       This action returns the newly started workflow execution.
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain  the following parameters by using a Condition element with
         the appropriate keys.

         o tagList.member.0 : The key is swf:tagList.member.0 .

         o tagList.member.1 : The key is swf:tagList.member.1 .

         o tagList.member.2 : The key is swf:tagList.member.2 .

         o tagList.member.3 : The key is swf:tagList.member.3 .

         o tagList.member.4 : The key is swf:tagList.member.4 .

         o taskList : String constraint. The key is swf:taskList.name .

         o workflowType.name : String constraint.  The  key  is  swf:workflow-
           Type.name .

         o workflowType.version  : String constraint. The key is swf:workflow-
           Type.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set  to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED  .  For  details  and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which the workflow execution is created.

       --workflow-id (string)
          The  user defined identifier associated with the workflow execution.
          You can use this to associate a custom identifier with the  workflow
          execution.  You may specify the same identifier if a workflow execu-
          tion is logically a restart of a previous execution. You cannot have
          two  open  workflow  executions with the same workflowId at the same
          time within the same domain.

          The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It  must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters (\u0000-\u001f | \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it  must  not  be
          the literal string arn .

       --workflow-type (structure)
          The type of the workflow to start.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The  combination  of  workflow  type name and version must be
                 unique with in a domain.

          version -> (string)
              The version of the workflow type.

              NOTE:
                 The combination of workflow type name  and  version  must  be
                 unique with in a domain.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --task-list (structure)
          The task list to use for the decision tasks generated for this work-
          flow execution. This overrides the  defaultTaskList  specified  when
          registering the workflow type.

          NOTE:
              A task list for this workflow execution must be specified either
              as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If
              neither this parameter is set nor a default task list was speci-
              fied at registration time then a fault is returned.

          The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It  must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters (\u0000-\u001f | \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it  must  not  be
          the literal string arn .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the task list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string"
          }

       --task-priority (string)
          The task priority to use for this workflow execution. This overrides
          any default priority that was assigned when the  workflow  type  was
          registered. If not set, then the default task priority for the work-
          flow type is used. Valid values are integers that range from  Java's
          Integer.MIN_VALUE  (-2147483648)  to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647).
          Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

          For more information about setting task priority, see  Setting  Task
          Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --input (string)
          The  input  for  the  workflow execution. This is a free form string
          which should be meaningful to the workflow you  are  starting.  This
          input  is  made available to the new workflow execution in the Work-
          flowExecutionStarted history event.

       --execution-start-to-close-timeout (string)
          The total duration for this workflow execution. This  overrides  the
          defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout  specified  when registering the
          workflow type.

          The duration is specified in seconds; an  integer  greater  than  or
          equal  to  0 . Exceeding this limit causes the workflow execution to
          time out. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF,
          you  cannot  specify  a value of "NONE" for this timeout; there is a
          one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run.

          NOTE:
              An execution start-to-close timeout  must  be  specified  either
              through this parameter or as a default when the workflow type is
              registered. If neither this parameter nor  a  default  execution
              start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned.

       --tag-list (list)
          The  list  of tags to associate with the workflow execution. You can
          specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can list workflow executions with a
          specific  tag by calling  ListOpenWorkflowExecutions or  ListClosed-
          WorkflowExecutions and specifying a  TagFilter .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --task-start-to-close-timeout (string)
          Specifies the maximum duration of decision tasks for  this  workflow
          execution.  This  parameter overrides the defaultTaskStartToCloseTi-
          mout specified when registering the workflow type  using   Register-
          WorkflowType .

          The  duration  is  specified  in seconds, an integer greater than or
          equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          NOTE:
              A task start-to-close timeout for this workflow  execution  must
              be  specified  either  as  a  default  for  the workflow type or
              through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set  nor  a
              default  task  start-to-close timeout was specified at registra-
              tion time then a fault is returned.

       --child-policy (string)
          If set, specifies the policy to use for the  child  workflow  execu-
          tions of this workflow execution if it is terminated, by calling the
          TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due  to  an  expired
          timeout.  This  policy  overrides the default child policy specified
          when registering the workflow type using  RegisterWorkflowType .

          The supported child policies are:

          o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

          o REQUEST_CANCEL  A request to cancel is attempted  for  each  child
            execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in
            its history. It is up to the decider to take  appropriate  actions
            when it receives an execution history with this event.

          o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

          NOTE:
              A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified ei-
              ther as a default for the workflow type or through this  parame-
              ter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy
              was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

          Possible values:

          o TERMINATE

          o REQUEST_CANCEL

          o ABANDON

       --lambda-role (string)
          The IAM role to attach to this workflow execution.

          NOTE:
              Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda
              functions.  If  you  don't  attach  an  IAM role, any attempt to
              schedule a Lambda task fails. This results in a  ScheduleLambda-
              FunctionFailed   history   event.   For  more  information,  see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html
              in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       runId -> (string)
          The runId of a workflow execution. This ID is generated by the  ser-
          vice  and  can  be  used to uniquely identify the workflow execution
          within a domain.
