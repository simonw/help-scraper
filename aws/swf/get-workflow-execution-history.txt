GET-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-HISTORY()              GET-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION-HISTORY()



NAME
       get-workflow-execution-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  history  of the specified workflow execution. The results
       may be split into multiple pages. To retrieve  subsequent  pages,  make
       the call again using the nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

       NOTE:
              This  operation  is  eventually consistent. The results are best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

       get-workflow-execution-history is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: events

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the workflow execution.

       --execution (structure)
          Specifies the workflow execution for which to return the history.

          workflowId -> (string)
              The  user defined identifier associated with the workflow execu-
              tion.

          runId -> (string)
              A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          workflowId=string,runId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "workflowId": "string",
            "runId": "string"
          }

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When set to true , returns the events in reverse order.  By  default
          the results are returned in ascending order of the eventTimeStamp of
          the events.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

              eventId -> (long)
                 The  system generated ID of the event. This ID uniquely iden-
                 tifies the event with in the workflow execution history.

              workflowExecutionStartedEventAttributes -> (structure)
                 If the event is of type  WorkflowExecutionStarted  then  this
                 member  is  set  and  provides detailed information about the
                 event. It isn't set for other event types.

                 input -> (string)

                     The duration is specified in seconds, an integer  greater
                     than  or  equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlim-
                     ited duration.

                     than or equal to 0 . You can use NONE to  specify  unlim-
                     ited duration.

                 childPolicy -> (string)
                     The  policy  to  use for the child workflow executions if
                     this workflow execution is  terminated,  by  calling  the
                     TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an
                     expired timeout.

                       each  child execution by recording a WorkflowExecution-
                       CancelRequested event in its history. It is up  to  the
                       decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
                       execution history with this event.

                     o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions  con-
                       tinue to run.

                 taskList -> (structure)
                     The  name  of  the  task list for scheduling the decision

                     tion.

                 workflowType -> (structure)
                     The workflow type of this execution.

                 continuedExecutionRunId -> (string)
                     If this workflow execution was started due to  a  Contin-
                     ueAsNewWorkflowExecution  decision,  then it contains the

                     The  source workflow execution that started this workflow
                     execution. The member isn't set if the workflow execution
