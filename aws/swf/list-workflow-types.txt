LIST-WORKFLOW-TYPES()                                    LIST-WORKFLOW-TYPES()



NAME
       list-workflow-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about workflow types in the specified domain. The
       results may be split into multiple pages that can be retrieved by  mak-
       ing the call repeatedly.
          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set  to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED  .  For  details  and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-workflow-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: typeInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-workflow-types
          --domain <value>
          [--name <value>]
          --registration-status <value>
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which the workflow types have been  regis-
          tered.

       --name (string)
          If specified, lists the workflow type with this name.

       --registration-status (string)
          Specifies the registration status of the workflow types to list.

          Possible values:

          o REGISTERED

          o DEPRECATED

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When  set to true , returns the results in reverse order. By default
          the results are returned in ascending alphabetical order of the name
          of the workflow types.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Listing Workflow Types

       To  get  a  list of the workflow types for a domain, use swf list-work-
       flow-types. The --domain and --registration-status  arguments  are  re-
       quired. Here's a simple example.

          aws swf list-workflow-types \
              --domain DataFrobtzz \
              --registration-status REGISTERED

       Output:

          {
              "typeInfos": [
                  {
                      "status": "REGISTERED",
                      "creationDate": 1371454149.598,
                      "description": "DataFrobtzz subscribe workflow",
                      "workflowType": {
                          "version": "v3",
                          "name": "subscribe"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       As  with list-activity-types, you can use the --name argument to select
       only workflow types  with  a  particular  name,  and  use  the  --maxi-
       mum-page-size  argument  in coordination with --next-page-token to page
       results. To reverse the order in which results are returned, use  --re-
       verse-order.

OUTPUT
       typeInfos -> (list)
          The list of workflow type information.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a workflow type.

              workflowType -> (structure)
                 The workflow type this information is about.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the workflow type.

                     NOTE:
                        The combination of workflow type name and version must
                        be unique with in a domain.

                 version -> (string)
                     The version of the workflow type.

                     NOTE:
                        The combination of workflow type name and version must
                        be unique with in a domain.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the workflow type.

              description -> (string)
                 The description of the type registered through  RegisterWork-
                 flowType .

              creationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when this type was registered.

              deprecationDate -> (timestamp)
                 If the type is in deprecated state, then it  is  set  to  the
                 date when the type was deprecated.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          If  a  NextPageToken was returned by a previous call, there are more
          results available. To retrieve the next page of  results,  make  the
          call  again  using  the  returned  token in nextPageToken . Keep all
          other arguments unchanged.

          The configured maximumPageSize determines how many  results  can  be
          returned in a single call.
