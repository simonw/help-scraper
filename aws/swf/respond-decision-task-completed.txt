RESPOND-DECISION-TASK-COMPLETED()            RESPOND-DECISION-TASK-COMPLETED()



NAME
       respond-decision-task-completed -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by deciders to tell the service that the  DecisionTask identified
       by the taskToken has successfully  completed.  The  decisions  argument
       specifies the list of decisions made while processing the task.

       A DecisionTaskCompleted event is added to the workflow history. The ex-
       ecutionContext specified is attached to the event in the workflow  exe-
       cution history.
          Access Control

       If  an IAM policy grants permission to use RespondDecisionTaskCompleted
       , it can express permissions for the list of decisions in the decisions
       parameter.  Each of the decisions has one or more parameters, much like
       a regular API call. To allow for policies to be as readable  as  possi-
       ble,  you  can  express permissions on decisions as if they were actual
       API calls, including applying conditions to some parameters.  For  more
       information,  see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in
       the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken from the  DecisionTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --decisions (list)
          The  list  of  decisions  (possibly empty) made by the decider while
          processing this decision task. See the docs for the  Decision struc-
          ture for details.

          (structure)
              Specifies  a decision made by the decider. A decision can be one
              of these types:

              o CancelTimer  Cancels a previously started timer and records  a
                TimerCanceled event in the history.

              o CancelWorkflowExecution   Closes  the  workflow  execution and
                records a WorkflowExecutionCanceled event in the history.

              o CompleteWorkflowExecution  Closes the workflow  execution  and
                records a WorkflowExecutionCompleted event in the history .

              o ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution   Closes the workflow execution
                and starts a new workflow execution of the same type using the
                same  workflow ID and a unique run Id. A WorkflowExecutionCon-
                tinuedAsNew event is recorded in the history.

              o FailWorkflowExecution   Closes  the  workflow  execution   and
                records a WorkflowExecutionFailed event in the history.

              o RecordMarker   Records  a MarkerRecorded event in the history.
                Markers can be used for adding custom information in the  his-
                tory for instance to let deciders know that they don't need to
                look at the history beyond the marker event.

              o RequestCancelActivityTask  Attempts  to  cancel  a  previously
                scheduled  activity  task.  If the activity task was scheduled
                but has not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If
                the  activity  task was already assigned to a worker, then the
                worker is informed that cancellation has been requested in the
                response to  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat .

              o RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution   Requests  that  a re-
                quest be made to cancel the specified external workflow execu-
                tion  and records a RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionIni-
                tiated event in the history.

              o ScheduleActivityTask  Schedules an activity task.

              o SignalExternalWorkflowExecution  Requests a signal to  be  de-
                livered  to  the  specified  external  workflow  execution and
                records a  SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated  event  in
                the history.

              o StartChildWorkflowExecution   Requests  that  a child workflow
                execution be started and  records  a  StartChildWorkflowExecu-
                tionInitiated  event in the history. The child workflow execu-
                tion is a separate workflow execution with its own history.

              o StartTimer  Starts a timer for  this  workflow  execution  and
                records  a TimerStarted event in the history. This timer fires
                after the specified delay and record a TimerFired event.
                 Access Control

              If you grant permission to  use  RespondDecisionTaskCompleted  ,
              you  can use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of
              decisions returned by this action as if they were members of the
              API. Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform con-
              ceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details  and
              example  IAM  policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon
              SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .
                 Decision Failure

              Decisions can fail for several reasons

              o The ordering of decisions should follow a logical  flow.  Some
                decisions  might  not make sense in the current context of the
                workflow execution and therefore fails.

              o A limit on your account was reached.

              o The decision lacks sufficient permissions.

              One of the following events might be added to the history to in-
              dicate an error. The event attribute's cause parameter indicates
              the cause. If cause is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED , the  de-
              cision  failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. For de-
              tails and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to  Manage  Access
              to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

              o ScheduleActivityTaskFailed   A  ScheduleActivityTask  decision
                failed. This could happen if the activity  type  specified  in
                the  decision  isn't  registered, is in a deprecated state, or
                the decision isn't properly configured.

              o RequestCancelActivityTaskFailed   A  RequestCancelActivityTask
                decision  failed. This could happen if there is no open activ-
                ity task with the specified activityId.

              o StartTimerFailed  A StartTimer  decision  failed.  This  could
                happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.

              o CancelTimerFailed   A  CancelTimer decision failed. This could
                happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.

              o StartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed  A  StartChildWorkflowExecu-
                tion  decision  failed. This could happen if the workflow type
                specified isn't registered, is  deprecated,  or  the  decision
                isn't properly configured.

              o SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed   A  SignalExternalWork-
                flowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the  work-
                flowID specified in the decision was incorrect.

              o RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed     A    Request-
                CancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision  failed.  This  could
                happen  if the workflowID specified in the decision was incor-
                rect.

              o CancelWorkflowExecutionFailed  A CancelWorkflowExecution deci-
                sion  failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled deci-
                sion task pending in the workflow execution.

              o CompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed   A  CompleteWorkflowExecution
                decision  failed.  This  could happen if there is an unhandled
                decision task pending in the workflow execution.

              o ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed    A   ContinueAsNewWork-
                flowExecution  decision  failed. This could happen if there is
                an unhandled decision task pending in the  workflow  execution
                or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not config-
                ured correctly.

              o FailWorkflowExecutionFailed  A FailWorkflowExecution  decision
                failed.  This  could  happen if there is an unhandled decision
                task pending in the workflow execution.

              The preceding error events might occur due to an  error  in  the
              decider  logic, which might put the workflow execution in an un-
              stable state The cause field in the event structure for the  er-
              ror event indicates the cause of the error.

              NOTE:
                     A  workflow execution may be closed by the decider by re-
                     turning one of the following decisions when completing  a
                     decision   task:  CompleteWorkflowExecution  ,  FailWork-
                     flowExecution , CancelWorkflowExecution  and  ContinueAs-
                     NewWorkflowExecution  . An UnhandledDecision fault is re-
                     turned if a workflow closing decision is specified and  a
                     signal  or  activity  event had been added to the history
                     while the decision task was being performed  by  the  de-
                     cider.  Unlike  the  above situations which are logic is-
                     sues, this fault is always possible because of race  con-
                     ditions in a distributed system. The right action here is
                     to call  RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without  any  deci-
                     sions.  This  would  result in another decision task with
                     these new events included in  the  history.  The  decider
                     should  handle the new events and may decide to close the
                     workflow execution.

                 How to Code a Decision

              You code a decision by first setting the decision type field  to
              one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding
              attributes field shown below:

              o `` ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` StartTimerDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` CancelTimerDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              o `` StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``

              decisionType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of the decision.

              scheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes -> (structure)
                 Provides the details of the ScheduleActivityTask decision. It
                 isn't set for other decision types.

                 activityType -> (structure)
                     The type of the activity task to schedule.

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of this activity.

                        NOTE:
                            The  combination of activity type name and version
                            must be unique within a domain.

                     version -> (string)
                        The version of this activity.

                        NOTE:
                            The combination of activity type name and  version
                            must be unique with in a domain.

                 activityId -> (string)
                     The activityId of the activity task.

                     The  specified  string  must  not  contain a : (colon), /
                     (slash), | (vertical  bar),  or  any  control  characters
                     (\u0000-\u001f  |  \u007f-\u009f  ). Also, it must not be
                     the literal string arn .

                 control -> (string)
                     Data attached to the event that can be used  by  the  de-
                     cider  in subsequent workflow tasks. This data isn't sent
                     to the activity.

                 input -> (string)
                     The input provided to the activity task.

                 scheduleToCloseTimeout -> (string)
                     The maximum duration for this activity task.

                     The duration is specified in seconds, an integer  greater
                     than  or  equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlim-
                     ited duration.

                     NOTE:
                        A schedule-to-close timeout  for  this  activity  task
                        must be specified either as a default for the activity
                        type or through this field. If neither this  field  is
                        set nor a default schedule-to-close timeout was speci-
                        fied at registration time then a fault is returned.

                 taskList -> (structure)
                     If set, specifies the name of the task list in  which  to
                     schedule  the  activity  task.  If not specified, the de-
                     faultTaskList registered with the activity type is used.

                     NOTE:
                        A task list for this activity task must  be  specified
                        either  as  a default for the activity type or through
                        this field. If neither this field is set nor a default
                        task  list  was  specified at registration time then a
                        fault is returned.

                     The specified string must not  contain  a  :  (colon),  /
                     (slash),  |  (vertical  bar),  or  any control characters
                     (\u0000-\u001f | \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it  must  not  be
                     the literal string arn .

                     name -> (string)
                        The name of the task list.

                 taskPriority -> (string)
                     If  set,  specifies  the priority with which the activity
                     task is to be assigned to a worker.  This  overrides  the
                     defaultTaskPriority specified when registering the activ-
                     ity type using  RegisterActivityType . Valid  values  are
                     integers   that   range   from  Java's  Integer.MIN_VALUE
                     (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE  (2147483647).  Higher
                     numbers indicate higher priority.

                     For  more  information  about  setting task priority, see
                     Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

                 scheduleToStartTimeout -> (string)
                     If set, specifies the maximum duration the activity  task
                     can  wait  to be assigned to a worker. This overrides the
                     default schedule-to-start timeout specified  when  regis-
                     tering the activity type using  RegisterActivityType .

                     The  duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater
                     than or equal to 0 . You can use NONE to  specify  unlim-
                     ited duration.

                     NOTE:
                        A  schedule-to-start  timeout  for  this activity task
                        must be specified either as a default for the activity
                        type  or  through this field. If neither this field is
                        set nor a default schedule-to-start timeout was speci-
                        fied at registration time then a fault is returned.

                 startToCloseTimeout -> (string)
                     If  set, specifies the maximum duration a worker may take
                     to process this activity task. This overrides the default
                     start-to-close timeout specified when registering the ac-
                     tivity type using  RegisterActivityType .

                     The duration is specified in seconds, an integer  greater
                     than  or  equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlim-
                     ited duration.

                     NOTE:
                        A start-to-close timeout for this activity  task  must
                        be specified either as a default for the activity type
                        or through this field. If neither this  field  is  set
                        nor  a default start-to-close timeout was specified at
                        registration time then a fault is returned.

                 heartbeatTimeout -> (string)
                     If set, specifies the maximum time before which a  worker
                     processing  a  task  of this type must report progress by
                     calling  RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat . If the timeout  is
                     exceeded,  the  activity task is automatically timed out.
                     If the worker subsequently attempts to record a heartbeat
                     or  returns  a  result, it is ignored. This overrides the
                     default heartbeat timeout specified when registering  the
                     activity type using  RegisterActivityType .

                     The  duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater

                     itly  or due to an expired timeout. This policy overrides
                     the default child policy specified when  registering  the
                     workflow type using  RegisterWorkflowType .

                     The supported child policies are:

                     o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

                     o REQUEST_CANCEL   A  request  to cancel is attempted for
                       each child execution by recording a  WorkflowExecution-
                       CancelRequested  event  in its history. It is up to the
                       decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
                       execution history with this event.

                     o ABANDON   No action is taken. The child executions con-
                       tinue to run.

                     NOTE:
                        A child policy for this  workflow  execution  must  be
                        specified either as a default for the workflow type or
                        through this parameter. If neither this  parameter  is
                        set nor a default child policy was specified at regis-
                        tration time then a fault is returned.

                     action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This pol-
                     icy overrides the default  child  policy  specified  when
                     registering the workflow type using  RegisterWorkflowType
                     .

                     The supported child policies are:

                     o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

                     o REQUEST_CANCEL  A request to cancel  is  attempted  for
                       each  child execution by recording a WorkflowExecution-
                       CancelRequested event in its history. It is up  to  the
                       decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an
                       execution history with this event.

                     o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions  con-
                       tinue to run.

                     NOTE:
                        A  child  policy  for  this workflow execution must be
                        specified either as a default for the workflow type or
                        through  this  parameter. If neither this parameter is
                        set nor a default child policy was specified at regis-
                        tration time then a fault is returned.

                 tagList -> (list)
                     The list of tags to associate with the child workflow ex-
                     ecution. A maximum of 5 tags can be  specified.  You  can
                     list  workflow  executions with a specific tag by calling
                     ListOpenWorkflowExecutions  or   ListClosedWorkflowExecu-
                     tions and specifying a  TagFilter .

                     (string)

                 lambdaRole -> (string)
                     The IAM role attached to the child workflow execution.

              scheduleLambdaFunctionDecisionAttributes -> (structure)
                 Provides  the details of the ScheduleLambdaFunction decision.
                 It isn't set for other decision types.

                 id -> (string)
                     A string that identifies the Lambda function execution in
                     the event history.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name, or ARN, of the Lambda function to schedule.

                 control -> (string)
                     The  data  attached to the event that the decider can use
                     in subsequent workflow tasks. This data isn't sent to the
                     Lambda task.

                 input -> (string)
                     The  optional  input  data  to  be supplied to the Lambda
                     function.

                 startToCloseTimeout -> (string)
                     The timeout value, in seconds,  after  which  the  Lambda
                     function  is considered to be failed once it has started.
                     This can be any integer from 1-900 (1s-15m).

                     If no value is supplied, then a default value of 900s  is
                     assumed.

       --execution-context (string)
          User defined context to add to workflow execution.

       --task-list (structure)
          The  task list to use for the future decision tasks of this workflow
          execution. This list overrides the original task list you  specified
          while starting the workflow execution.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the task list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string"
          }

       --task-list-schedule-to-start-timeout (string)
          Specifies  a  timeout  (in seconds) for the task list override. When
          this parameter is missing, the task list override is permanent. This
          parameter  makes  it possible to temporarily override the task list.
          If a decision task scheduled  on  the  override  task  list  is  not
          started  within the timeout, the decision task will time out. Amazon
          SWF will revert the override and schedule a new decision task to the
          original task list.

          If  a  decision  task scheduled on the override task list is started
          within the timeout, but  not  completed  within  the  start-to-close
          timeout, Amazon SWF will also revert the override and schedule a new
          decision task to the original task list.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
