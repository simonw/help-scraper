NAME
       list-closed-workflow-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list  of closed workflow executions in the specified domain
       that meet the filtering criteria. The results may be split into  multi-
       ple  pages. To retrieve subsequent pages, make the call again using the
       nextPageToken returned by the initial call.

       NOTE:
              This operation is eventually consistent. The  results  are  best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o tagFilter.tag : String constraint. The key is swf:tagFilter.tag .

         o typeFilter.name : String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.name
           .

         o typeFilter.version  :  String  constraint.  The  key  is  swf:type-
           Filter.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-closed-workflow-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: executionInfos

       --start-time-filter (structure)
          If specified, the workflow executions are included in  the  returned
          results  based  on  whether  their  start times are within the range
          specified by this filter. Also, if this parameter is specified,  the
          returned results are ordered by their start times.

          NOTE:
              startTimeFilter  and closeTimeFilter are mutually exclusive. You
              must specify one of these in a request but not both.

              Specifies the oldest start or close date and time to return.

          latestDate -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the latest start or close date and time to return.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          oldestDate=timestamp,latestDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "oldestDate": timestamp,

          }

       --close-time-filter (structure)
          If specified, the workflow executions are included in  the  returned
          results  based  on  whether  their  close times are within the range
          specified by this filter. Also, if this parameter is specified,  the
          returned results are ordered by their close times.

          NOTE:
              startTimeFilter  and closeTimeFilter are mutually exclusive. You
              must specify one of these in a request but not both.

          {
            "workflowId": "string"
          }

       --close-status-filter (structure)
          If  specified, only workflow executions that match this close status
          are listed. For example, if TERMINATED is specified, then only  TER-
          MINATED workflow executions are listed.

          }

       --type-filter (structure)
          If specified, only executions of the type specified  in  the  filter
          are returned.

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          When  set to true , returns the results in reverse order. By default
          the results are returned in descending order of  the  start  or  the
          close time of the executions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       executionInfos -> (list)
          The list of workflow information structures.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a workflow execution.

              execution -> (structure)
                 The workflow execution this information is about.

                 workflowId -> (string)
                     The  user defined identifier associated with the workflow
                     execution.

                 runId -> (string)
                     A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow ex-
                     ecution.

              workflowType -> (structure)
                 The type of the workflow execution.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the workflow type.

                     NOTE:
                        The combination of workflow type name and version must
                        be unique with in a domain.

                 version -> (string)
                     The version of the workflow type.

                     NOTE:
                        The combination of workflow type name and version must
                        be unique with in a domain.

              startTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the execution was started.

              closeTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time when the workflow execution was closed. Set only if
                 the execution status is CLOSED.

              executionStatus -> (string)
                 The current status of the execution.

              closeStatus -> (string)
                 If the execution status is closed then this specifies how the
                 execution was closed:

                 o COMPLETED  the execution was successfully completed.

                 o CANCELED   the  execution  was canceled.Cancellation allows
                   the implementation to gracefully clean up before the execu-
                   tion is closed.

                 o TERMINATED  the execution was force terminated.

                 o FAILED  the execution failed to complete.

                 o TIMED_OUT   the  execution  did not complete in the alloted
                   time and was automatically timed out.

                 o CONTINUED_AS_NEW  the  execution  is  logically  continued.
                   This  means  the  current execution was completed and a new
                   execution was started to carry on the workflow.

              parent -> (structure)
                 If this workflow execution is a child  of  another  execution
                 then contains the workflow execution that started this execu-
                 tion.

                 workflowId -> (string)
                     The user defined identifier associated with the  workflow
                     execution.

                 runId -> (string)
                     A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow ex-
                     ecution.

              tagList -> (list)
                 The list of tags associated with the workflow execution. Tags
                 can  be  used to identify and list workflow executions of in-
                 terest through the visibility APIs. A workflow execution  can
                 have a maximum of 5 tags.

                 (string)

              cancelRequested -> (boolean)
                 Set  to true if a cancellation is requested for this workflow
                 execution.

       nextPageToken -> (string)
          If a NextPageToken was returned by a previous call, there  are  more
          results  available.  To  retrieve the next page of results, make the
          call again using the returned token  in  nextPageToken  .  Keep  all
          other arguments unchanged.

          The  configured  maximumPageSize  determines how many results can be
          returned in a single call.
