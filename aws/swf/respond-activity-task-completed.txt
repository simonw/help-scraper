RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-COMPLETED()            RESPOND-ACTIVITY-TASK-COMPLETED()



NAME
       respond-activity-task-completed -

DESCRIPTION
       Used  by  workers to tell the service that the  ActivityTask identified
       by the taskToken completed successfully with a  result  (if  provided).
       The  result  appears in the ActivityTaskCompleted event in the workflow
       history.

       WARNING:
          If the requested task doesn't complete successfully, use  RespondAc-
          tivityTaskFailed  instead. If the worker finds that the task is can-
          celed through the canceled  flag  returned  by   RecordActivityTask-
          Heartbeat  ,  it should cancel the task, clean up and then call  Re-
          spondActivityTaskCanceled .

       A task is considered open from the time that it is scheduled  until  it
       is  closed. Therefore a task is reported as open while a worker is pro-
       cessing it. A task is closed after it has been specified in a  call  to
       RespondActivityTaskCompleted,   RespondActivityTaskCanceled  ,  Respon-
       dActivityTaskFailed , or the task has timed out .
          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            respond-activity-task-completed
          --task-token <value>
          [--result <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-token (string)
          The taskToken of the  ActivityTask .

          WARNING:
              taskToken is generated by the service and should be  treated  as
              an  opaque  value. If the task is passed to another process, its
              taskToken must also be passed. This enables it  to  provide  its
              progress and respond with results.

       --result (string)
          The  result  of  the activity task. It is a free form string that is
          implementation specific.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
