NAME
       describe-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the specified workflow execution including
       its type and some statistics.

       NOTE:
              This operation is eventually consistent. The  results  are  best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set  to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED  .  For  details  and example IAM policies, see
       Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in  the  Amazon  SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workflow-execution
          --domain <value>
          --execution <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the workflow execution.

       --execution (structure)
          The workflow execution to describe.

          workflowId -> (string)
              The  user defined identifier associated with the workflow execu-
              tion.

          runId -> (string)
              A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow execution.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          workflowId=string,runId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "workflowId": "string",
            "runId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of workflow type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

              version -> (string)
                 The version of the workflow type.

                 NOTE:
                     The combination of workflow type name and version must be
                     unique with in a domain.

          startTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time when the execution was started.

          closeTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time when the workflow execution was closed. Set only if the
              execution status is CLOSED.

          executionStatus -> (string)
              The current status of the execution.

          closeStatus -> (string)
              If the execution status is closed then this  specifies  how  the
              execution was closed:

              o COMPLETED  the execution was successfully completed.

              o CANCELED   the  execution was canceled.Cancellation allows the
                implementation to gracefully clean up before the execution  is
                closed.

              o TERMINATED  the execution was force terminated.

              o FAILED  the execution failed to complete.

              o TIMED_OUT   the execution did not complete in the alloted time
                and was automatically timed out.

              o CONTINUED_AS_NEW  the execution is logically  continued.  This
                means  the current execution was completed and a new execution
                was started to carry on the workflow.

          parent -> (structure)
              If this workflow execution is a child of another execution  then
              contains the workflow execution that started this execution.

              workflowId -> (string)
                 The user defined identifier associated with the workflow exe-
                 cution.

              runId -> (string)
                 A system-generated unique identifier for the workflow  execu-
                 tion.

          tagList -> (list)
              The  list  of  tags associated with the workflow execution. Tags
              can be used to identify and list workflow executions of interest
              through  the  visibility  APIs.  A workflow execution can have a
              maximum of 5 tags.

              (string)

          cancelRequested -> (boolean)
              Set to true if a cancellation is requested for this workflow ex-
              ecution.

       executionConfiguration -> (structure)

          timeout values, tasklist etc.

          taskStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The maximum duration allowed for decision tasks for  this  work-
              flow execution.

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          executionStartToCloseTimeout -> (string)
              The total duration for this workflow execution.

              The duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or
              equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

          taskList -> (structure)
              The  task  list  used  for the decision tasks generated for this
              workflow execution.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the task list.

          taskPriority -> (string)
              The priority assigned to decision tasks for this workflow execu-
              tion.  Valid  values  are  integers that range from Java's Inte-
              ger.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to  Integer.MAX_VALUE  (2147483647).
              Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

              For  more  information  about setting task priority, see Setting
              Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

          childPolicy -> (string)
              The policy to use for the  child  workflow  executions  if  this
              workflow execution is terminated, by calling the  TerminateWork-
              flowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout.

              The supported child policies are:

              o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

              o REQUEST_CANCEL  A request to  cancel  is  attempted  for  each
                child  execution  by  recording  a  WorkflowExecutionCancelRe-
                quested event in its history. It is up to the decider to  take
                appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with
                this event.

              o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions continue  to
                run.

              The count of timers started by this workflow execution that have
              not fired yet.

          openChildWorkflowExecutions -> (integer)
              The count of child workflow executions whose status is OPEN .

          openLambdaFunctions -> (integer)
              The count of Lambda tasks whose status is OPEN .

       latestActivityTaskTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          The time when the last activity task was scheduled for this workflow
          execution. You can use this information to determine if the workflow
          has not made progress for an unusually long period of time and might
          require a corrective action.

       latestExecutionContext -> (string)
          The  latest  executionContext provided by the decider for this work-
          flow  execution.  A  decider  can  provide  an  executionContext  (a
