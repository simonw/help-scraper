TERMINATE-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()                  TERMINATE-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION()



NAME
       terminate-workflow-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Records  a  WorkflowExecutionTerminated event and forces closure of the
       workflow execution identified by the given  domain,  runId,  and  work-
       flowId.  The  child policy, registered with the workflow type or speci-
       fied when starting this execution, is applied to any open  child  work-
       flow executions of this workflow execution.

       WARNING:
          If  the  identified workflow execution was in progress, it is termi-
          nated immediately.

       NOTE:
          If a runId isn't  specified,  then  the  WorkflowExecutionTerminated
          event  is  recorded in the history of the current open workflow with
          the matching workflowId in the domain.

       NOTE:
              You should consider using  RequestCancelWorkflowExecution action
              instead because it allows the workflow to gracefully close while
              TerminateWorkflowExecution doesn't.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o You cannot use an IAM policy to constrain this action's parameters.

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            terminate-workflow-execution
          --domain <value>
          --workflow-id <value>
          [--run-id <value>]
          [--reason <value>]
          [--details <value>]
          [--child-policy <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The domain of the workflow execution to terminate.

       --workflow-id (string)
          The workflowId of the workflow execution to terminate.

       --run-id (string)
          The runId of the workflow execution to terminate.

       --reason (string)
          A descriptive reason for terminating the workflow execution.

       --details (string)
          Details for terminating the workflow execution.

       --child-policy (string)
          If set, specifies the policy to use for the  child  workflow  execu-
          tions  of the workflow execution being terminated. This policy over-
          rides the child policy specified for the workflow execution at  reg-
          istration time or when starting the execution.

          The supported child policies are:

          o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

          o REQUEST_CANCEL   A  request  to cancel is attempted for each child
            execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in
            its  history.  It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions
            when it receives an execution history with this event.

          o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

          NOTE:
              A child policy for this workflow execution must be specified ei-
              ther  as a default for the workflow type or through this parame-
              ter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy
              was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.

          Possible values:

          o TERMINATE

          o REQUEST_CANCEL

          o ABANDON

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
