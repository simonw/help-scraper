REGISTER-WORKFLOW-TYPE()                              REGISTER-WORKFLOW-TYPE()



NAME
       register-workflow-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  new  workflow  type and its configuration settings in the
       specified domain.

       The retention period for the workflow history is set by the   Register-
       Domain action.

       WARNING:
              If  the  type  already exists, then a TypeAlreadyExists fault is
              returned. You cannot change  the  configuration  settings  of  a
              workflow type once it is registered and it must be registered as
              a new version.

          Access Control

       You can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon  SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use  a  Resource  element with the domain name to limit the action to
         only specified domains.

       o Use an Action element to allow or deny permission to  call  this  ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain  the following parameters by using a Condition element with
         the appropriate keys.

         o defaultTaskList.name : String constraint. The key  is  swf:default-
           TaskList.name .

         o name : String constraint. The key is swf:name .

         o version : String constraint. The key is swf:version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain in which to register the workflow type.

       --name (string)
          The name of the workflow type.

          The specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It  must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters (\u0000-\u001f | \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it  must  not  be
          the literal string arn .

       --description (string)
          Textual description of the workflow type.

       --default-task-start-to-close-timeout (string)
          If set, specifies the default maximum duration of decision tasks for
          this workflow type. This default can be overridden when  starting  a
          workflow  execution  using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the
          StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

          The duration is specified in seconds, an  integer  greater  than  or
          equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.

       --default-execution-start-to-close-timeout (string)
          If  set,  specifies  the  default maximum duration for executions of
          this workflow type. You can override this default when  starting  an
          execution  through the  StartWorkflowExecution Action or StartChild-
          WorkflowExecution   Decision .

          The duration is specified in seconds; an  integer  greater  than  or
          equal  to  0.  Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon
          SWF, you cannot specify a value of "NONE" for defaultExecutionStart-
          ToCloseTimeout  ;  there  is a one-year max limit on the time that a
          workflow execution can run. Exceeding this limit always  causes  the
          workflow execution to time out.

       --default-task-list (structure)
          If  set, specifies the default task list to use for scheduling deci-
          sion tasks for executions of this workflow  type.  This  default  is
          used  only if a task list isn't provided when starting the execution
          through the  StartWorkflowExecution Action or StartChildWorkflowExe-
          cution   Decision .

          name -> (string)
              The name of the task list.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string"
          }

       --default-task-priority (string)
          The default task priority to assign to the workflow type. If not as-
          signed, then 0 is used. Valid values are integers  that  range  from
          Java's    Integer.MIN_VALUE   (-2147483648)   to   Integer.MAX_VALUE
          (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.

          For more information about setting task priority, see  Setting  Task
          Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --default-child-policy (string)
          If  set,  specifies the default policy to use for the child workflow
          executions when a workflow execution of this type is terminated,  by
          calling  the  TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to
          an expired timeout. This default can be overridden when  starting  a
          workflow  execution  using the  StartWorkflowExecution action or the
          StartChildWorkflowExecution   Decision .

          The supported child policies are:

          o TERMINATE  The child executions are terminated.

          o REQUEST_CANCEL  A request to cancel is attempted  for  each  child
            execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in
            its history. It is up to the decider to take  appropriate  actions
            when it receives an execution history with this event.

          o ABANDON  No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.

          Possible values:

          o TERMINATE

          o REQUEST_CANCEL

          o ABANDON

       --default-lambda-role (string)
          The default IAM role attached to this workflow type.

          NOTE:
              Executions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda
              functions. If you don't specify an IAM role when you start  this
              workflow type, the default Lambda role is attached to the execu-
              tion.         For         more         information,          see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/developerguide/lambda-task.html
              in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .

       --workflow-version (string)
          The version of the workflow type.

          NOTE:
              The workflow type consists of the name and version, the combina-
              tion of which must be unique within the domain. To get a list of
              all currently registered workflow types, use the   ListWorkflow-
              Types action.

          The  specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must
          not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control
          characters  (\u0000-\u001f  |  \u007f-\u009f ). Also, it must not be
          the literal string arn .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Registering a Workflow Type

       To  register  a  Workflow  type  with  the  AWS CLI, use the swf regis-
       ter-workflow-type command.

          aws swf register-workflow-type \
              --domain DataFrobtzz \
              --name "MySimpleWorkflow" \
              --workflow-version "v1"

       If successful, the command produces no output.

       On an error (for example, if you try  to  register  the  same  workflow
       typetwice,  or  specify a domain that doesn't exist) you will get a re-
       sponse in JSON.

          {
              "message": "WorkflowType=[name=MySimpleWorkflow, version=v1]",
              "__type": "com.amazonaws.swf.base.model#TypeAlreadyExistsFault"
          }

       The --domain, --name and --workflow-version are required. You can  also
       set the workflow description, timeouts, and child workflow policy.

       Workflow Service API Reference

OUTPUT
       None
