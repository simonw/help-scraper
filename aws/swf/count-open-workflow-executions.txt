COUNT-OPEN-WORKFLOW-EXECUTIONS()              COUNT-OPEN-WORKFLOW-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       count-open-workflow-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the number of open workflow executions within the given domain
       that meet the specified filtering criteria.

       NOTE:
              This operation is eventually consistent. The  results  are  best
              effort and may not exactly reflect recent updates and changes.

          Access Control

       You  can use IAM policies to control this action's access to Amazon SWF
       resources as follows:

       o Use a Resource element with the domain name to limit  the  action  to
         only specified domains.

       o Use  an  Action  element to allow or deny permission to call this ac-
         tion.

       o Constrain the following parameters by using a Condition element  with
         the appropriate keys.

         o tagFilter.tag : String constraint. The key is swf:tagFilter.tag .

         o typeFilter.name : String constraint. The key is swf:typeFilter.name
           .

         o typeFilter.version  :  String  constraint.  The  key  is  swf:type-
           Filter.version .

       If the caller doesn't have sufficient permissions to invoke the action,
       or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the ac-
       tion  fails. The associated event attribute's cause parameter is set to
       OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED . For details and  example  IAM  policies,  see
       Using  IAM  to  Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF
       Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            count-open-workflow-executions
          --domain <value>
          --start-time-filter <value>
          [--type-filter <value>]
          [--tag-filter <value>]
          [--execution-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the workflow executions to count.

       --start-time-filter (structure)
          Specifies the start time criteria that workflow executions must meet
          in order to be counted.

          oldestDate -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the oldest start or close date and time to return.

          latestDate -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the latest start or close date and time to return.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          oldestDate=timestamp,latestDate=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "oldestDate": timestamp,
            "latestDate": timestamp
          }

       --type-filter (structure)
          Specifies the type of the workflow executions to be counted.

          NOTE:
              executionFilter  ,  typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclu-
              sive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

          name -> (string)
              Name of the workflow type.

          version -> (string)
              Version of the workflow type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "name": "string",
            "version": "string"
          }

       --tag-filter (structure)
          If specified, only executions that have a tag that matches the  fil-
          ter are counted.

          NOTE:
              executionFilter  ,  typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclu-
              sive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

          tag -> (string)
              Specifies the tag that must be associated with the execution for
              it to meet the filter criteria.

              Tags  may  only  contain unicode letters, digits, whitespace, or
              these symbols: _ . : / = + - @ .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          tag=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "tag": "string"
          }

       --execution-filter (structure)
          If specified, only workflow executions matching  the  WorkflowId  in
          the filter are counted.

          NOTE:
              executionFilter  ,  typeFilter and tagFilter are mutually exclu-
              sive. You can specify at most one of these in a request.

          workflowId -> (string)
              The workflowId to pass of match the criteria of this filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          workflowId=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "workflowId": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Counting Open Workflow Executions

       You can use swf count-open-workflow-executions to retrieve  the  number
       of open workflow executions for a given domain. You can specify filters
       to count specific classes of executions.

       The --domain and --start-time-filter arguments are required. All  other
       arguments are optional.

       Here is a basic example:

          aws swf count-open-workflow-executions --domain DataFrobtzz --start-time-filter "{ \"latestDate\" : 1377129600, \"oldestDate\" : 1370044800 }"

       Result:

          {
            "count": 4,
            "truncated": false
          }

       If "truncated" is true, then "count" represents the maximum number that
       can be returned by Amazon SWF. Any further results are truncated.

       To reduce the number of results returned, you can:

       o modify the --start-time-filter values to narrow the time  range  that
         is searched.

       o

         use  the  --close-status-filter,  --execution-filter, --tag-filter or
         --type-filter arguments to further
                filter the results. Each of these is mutually  exclusive:  You
                can specify only one of these in a request.

       For  more  information,  see  CountOpenWorkflowExecutions in the Amazon
       Simple Workflow Service API Reference

OUTPUT
       count -> (integer)
          The number of workflow executions.

       truncated -> (boolean)
          If set to true, indicates that the actual count was  more  than  the
          maximum  supported  by  this API and the count returned is the trun-
          cated value.
