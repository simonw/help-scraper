ROTATE-SECRET()                                                ROTATE-SECRET()



NAME
       rotate-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Configures and starts the asynchronous process of rotating the secret.

       If  you  include  the  configuration parameters, the operation sets the
       values for the secret and then immediately starts a  rotation.  If  you
       don't  include the configuration parameters, the operation starts a ro-
       tation with the values already stored in the secret. For more  informa-
       tion about rotation, see Rotate secrets .

       To  configure  rotation,  you include the ARN of an Amazon Web Services
       Lambda function and the schedule for the rotation. The Lambda  rotation
       function creates a new version of the secret and creates or updates the
       credentials on the database or service to match. After testing the  new
       credentials, the function marks the new secret version with the staging
       label AWSCURRENT . Then anyone who retrieves the secret  gets  the  new
       version. For more information, see How rotation works .

       When  rotation is successful, the AWSPENDING staging label might be at-
       tached to the same version as the AWSCURRENT version, or it  might  not
       be attached to any version.

       If the AWSPENDING staging label is present but not attached to the same
       version as AWSCURRENT , then any later invocation of  RotateSecret  as-
       sumes that a previous rotation request is still in progress and returns
       an error.

       To run this command, you must have secretsmanager:RotateSecret  permis-
       sions  and  lambda:InvokeFunction permissions on the function specified
       in the secret's metadata.

SYNOPSIS
            rotate-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--rotation-lambda-arn <value>]
          [--rotation-rules <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to rotate.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of the secret that helps en-
          sure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the ac-
          cidental  creation  of  duplicate versions if there are failures and
          retries during rotation. This value becomes the VersionId of the new
          version.

          If you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web Ser-
          vices SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this  parameter
          empty.  The  CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes
          that in the request for this parameter. If you don't use the SDK and
          instead  generate  a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service
          endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken  yourself  for
          new versions and include that value in the request.

          You  only need to specify this value if you implement your own retry
          logic and you want to ensure that Secrets Manager doesn't attempt to
          create  a  secret  version  twice.  We recommend that you generate a
          UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness within the specified secret.

       --rotation-lambda-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Lambda rotation function that can rotate the secret.

       --rotation-rules (structure)
          A structure that defines the rotation configuration for this secret.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days between automatic  scheduled  rota-
              tions of the secret.

              Secrets  Manager  schedules  the next rotation when the previous
              one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the  date  by  adding
              the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the
              last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that  24-hour
              date  window  randomly.  The minute is also chosen somewhat ran-
              domly, but weighted towards the top of the hour  and  influenced
              by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutomaticallyAfterDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutomaticallyAfterDays": long
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To configure and start automatic rotation for a secret

       The following rotate-secret example configures and starts automatic ro-
       tation for a secret. Secrets Manager rotates the  secret  once  immedi-
       ately  and  then automatically every 10 days. The output shows the Ver-
       sionId of the new secret version created by rotation.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret \
              --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:1234566789012:function:SecretsManagerTestRotationLambda \
              --rotation-rules AutomaticallyAfterDays=10

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For more information, see This is the topic title in the  Secrets  Man-
       ager User Guide.

       Example 2: To rotate a secret immediately

       The  following  rotate-secret example starts an immediate rotation. The
       output shows the VersionId of the new secret version created  by  rota-
       tion. The secret must already have rotation configured.

          aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \
              --secret-id MyTestDatabaseSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "aws:arn:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestDatabaseSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestDatabaseSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       Guide.
