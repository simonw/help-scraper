OPTIONS
       --password-length (long)
          The length of the password. If you don't include this parameter, the
          default length is 32 characters.

       --exclude-characters (string)
          A string of the characters that you don't want in the password.

       --exclude-numbers | --no-exclude-numbers (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude numbers from the password. If you don't
          include this switch, the password can contain numbers.

       --exclude-punctuation | --no-exclude-punctuation (boolean)
          Specifies  whether  to  exclude the following punctuation characters
          from the password: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ]
          ^  _  ` { | } ~ . If you don't include this switch, the password can
          contain punctuation.

       --exclude-uppercase | --no-exclude-uppercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude uppercase letters from the password. If
          you  don't  include  this switch, the password can contain uppercase
          letters.

       --exclude-lowercase | --no-exclude-lowercase (boolean)
          Specifies whether to exclude lowercase letters from the password. If
          you  don't  include  this switch, the password can contain lowercase
          letters.

       --include-space | --no-include-space (boolean)
          Specifies whether to include the space  character.  If  you  include
          this switch, the password can contain space characters.

       --require-each-included-type  |  --no-require-each-included-type (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies whether to include at least one upper and  lowercase  let-
          ter,  one  number,  and  one  punctuation. If you don't include this
          switch, the password contains at least one of every character type.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
