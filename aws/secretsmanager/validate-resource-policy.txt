VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()                          VALIDATE-RESOURCE-POLICY()



NAME
       validate-resource-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Validates that a resource policy does not grant a wide range of princi-
       pals access to your secret. A resource-based policy is optional for se-
       crets.

       The API performs three checks when validating the policy:

       o Sends  a  call  to Zelkova , an automated reasoning engine, to ensure
         your resource policy does not allow broad access to your secret,  for
         example policies that use a wildcard for the principal.

       o Checks for correct syntax in a policy.

       o Verifies the policy does not lock out a caller.
          Required  permissions:   secretsmanager:ValidateResourcePolicy . For
          more information, see IAM policy actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            validate-resource-policy
          [--secret-id <value>]
          --resource-policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          This field is reserved for internal use.

       --resource-policy (string)
          A  JSON-formatted  string  that  contains an Amazon Web Services re-
          source-based policy. The policy in the string identifies who can ac-
          cess  or  manage this secret and its versions. For example policies,
          see Permissions policy examples .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To validate a resource policy

       The  following  validate-resource-policy example checks that a resource
       policy doesn't grant broad access to a secret. The policy is read  from
       a  file  on  disk. For more information, see Loading AWS CLI parameters
       from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager validate-resource-policy \
              --resource-policy file://mypolicy.json

       Contents of mypolicy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
                      },
                      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                      "Resource": "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "PolicyValidationPassed": true,
              "ValidationErrors": []
          }

       For more information, see Permissions reference for Secrets Manager  in
       the Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       PolicyValidationPassed -> (boolean)
          True if your policy passes validation, otherwise false.

       ValidationErrors -> (list)
          Validation errors if your policy didn't pass validation.

          (structure)
              Displays  errors that occurred during validation of the resource
              policy.

              CheckName -> (string)
                 Checks the name of the policy.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 Displays error messages  if  validation  encounters  problems
                 during validation of the resource policy.
