DESCRIBE-SECRET()                                            DESCRIBE-SECRET()



NAME
       describe-secret -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  of a secret. It does not include the encrypted
       secret value. Secrets Manager only returns fields that have a value  in
       the response.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-secret
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.

       Description -> (string)
          The description of the secret.

       KmsKeyId -> (string)
          The ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses to encrypt the  se-
          cret  value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon Web Services
          managed key aws/secretsmanager , this field is omitted.

       RotationEnabled -> (boolean)
          Specifies whether automatic rotation is turned on for this secret.

          To turn on rotation, use  RotateSecret . To turn off  rotation,  use
          CancelRotateSecret .

       RotationLambdaARN -> (string)
          The  ARN  of the Lambda function that Secrets Manager invokes to ro-
          tate the secret.

       RotationRules -> (structure)
          The rotation schedule and Lambda function for this  secret.  If  the
          secret  previously had rotation turned on, but it is now turned off,
          this field shows the previous rotation schedule and  rotation  func-
          tion.  If  the  secret  never  had rotation turned on, this field is
          omitted.

          AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
              Specifies the number of days between automatic  scheduled  rota-
              tions of the secret.

              Secrets  Manager  schedules  the next rotation when the previous
              one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the  date  by  adding
              the rotation interval (number of days) to the actual date of the
              last rotation. The service chooses the hour within that  24-hour
              date  window  randomly.  The minute is also chosen somewhat ran-
              domly, but weighted towards the top of the hour  and  influenced
              by a variety of factors that help distribute load.

       LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  last  date and time that Secrets Manager rotated the secret. If
          the secret isn't configured for rotation,  Secrets  Manager  returns
          null.

       LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)
          The last date and time that this secret was modified in any way.

       LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  last  date that the secret value was retrieved. This value does
          not include the time. This field is omitted if the secret has  never
          been retrieved.

       DeletedDate -> (timestamp)
          The  date  the secret is scheduled for deletion. If it is not sched-
          uled for deletion, this field is omitted. When you delete a  secret,
          Secrets Manager requires a recovery window of at least 7 days before
          deleting the secret. Some time after the deleted date, Secrets  Man-
          ager deletes the secret, including all of its versions.

          If  a  secret is scheduled for deletion, then its details, including
          the encrypted secret value, is not accessible. To cancel a scheduled
          deletion and restore access to the secret, use  RestoreSecret .

       Tags -> (list)
          The  list  of  tags attached to the secret. To add tags to a secret,
          use  TagResource . To remove tags, use  UntagResource .

          (structure)
              A structure that contains information about a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The string value associated with the key of the tag.

       VersionIdsToStages -> (map)
          A list of the versions of the secret that have  staging  labels  at-
          tached.  Versions that don't have staging labels are considered dep-
          recated and Secrets Manager can delete them.

          Secrets Manager uses staging labels to indicate the status of a  se-
          cret  version during rotation. The three staging labels for rotation
          are:

          o AWSCURRENT , which indicates the current version of the secret.

          o AWSPENDING , which indicates the version of the secret  that  con-
            tains  new  secret  information  that will become the next current
            version when rotation finishes. During rotation,  Secrets  Manager
            creates  an  AWSPENDING  version ID before creating the new secret
            version. To check if a secret version exists, call  GetSecretValue
            .

          o AWSPREVIOUS  , which indicates the previous current version of the
            secret. You can use this as the last known good version.

          For more information about rotation and staging labels, see How  ro-
          tation works .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       OwningService -> (string)
          The name of the service that created this secret.

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the secret was created.

       PrimaryRegion -> (string)
          The  Region the secret is in. If a secret is replicated to other Re-
          gions, the replicas are listed in ReplicationStatus .

       ReplicationStatus -> (list)
          A list of the replicas of this secret and their status:

          o Failed , which indicates that the replica was not created.

          o InProgress , which  indicates  that  Secrets  Manager  is  in  the
            process of creating the replica.

          o InSync , which indicates that the replica was created.

          (structure)
              A replication object consisting of a RegionReplicationStatus ob-
              ject and includes a Region, KMSKeyId, status,  and  status  mes-
              sage.

              Region -> (string)
                 The Region where replication occurs.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 Can be an ARN , Key ID , or Alias .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status can be InProgress , Failed , or InSync .

              StatusMessage -> (string)
                 Status  message such as "Secret with this name already exists
                 in this region ".

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date that you last accessed the secret in the Region.
