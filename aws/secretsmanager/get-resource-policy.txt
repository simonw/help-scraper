       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-resource-policy
          --secret-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The  ARN  or  name  of  the  secret  to  retrieve  the  attached re-
          source-based policy for.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "ResourcePolicy": "{\n\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\n\"Statement\":[{\n\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\n
              \"Principal\":{\n\"AWS\":\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root\"\n},\n\"Action\":
              \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\",\n\"Resource\":\"*\"\n}]\n}"
