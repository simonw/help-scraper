GET-SECRET-VALUE()                                          GET-SECRET-VALUE()



NAME
       get-secret-value -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the contents of the encrypted fields SecretString or Secret-
       Binary from the specified version of a secret, whichever contains  con-
       tent.

       For  information  about retrieving the secret value in the console, see
       Retrieve secrets .

       To run this command, you must have  secretsmanager:GetSecretValue  per-
       missions.  If  the secret is encrypted using a customer-managed key in-
       stead of the Amazon Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager ,  then
       you also need kms:Decrypt permissions for that key.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-secret-value
          --secret-id <value>
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--version-stage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to retrieve.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --version-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the version of the secret to  retrieve.  If
          you  include  both this parameter and VersionStage , the two parame-
          ters must refer to the same secret version. If you don't specify ei-
          ther  a VersionStage or VersionId , then Secrets Manager returns the
          AWSCURRENT version.

          This value is typically a UUID-type value with 32  hexadecimal  dig-
          its.

       --version-stage (string)
          The staging label of the version of the secret to retrieve.

          Secrets  Manager uses staging labels to keep track of different ver-
          sions during the rotation process. If you include both this  parame-
          ter and VersionId , the two parameters must refer to the same secret
          version. If you don't specify either a VersionStage or  VersionId  ,
          Secrets Manager returns the AWSCURRENT version.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the encrypted secret value of a secret

       The  following  get-secret-value example gets the current secret value.
       To get the previous secret value, include  --version-stage AWSPREVIOUS.

          aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "SecretString": "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"i29wwX!%9wFV\"}",
              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSCURRENT"
              ],
              "CreatedDate": 1523477145.713
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The friendly name of the secret.

       VersionId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of this version of the secret.

       SecretBinary -> (blob)
          The  decrypted secret value, if the secret value was originally pro-
          vided as binary data in the form of a byte array. The  response  pa-
          rameter represents the binary data as a base64-encoded string.

          If  the  secret was created by using the Secrets Manager console, or
          if the secret value was originally provided as a string,  then  this
          field is omitted. The secret value appears in SecretString instead.

       SecretString -> (string)
          The  decrypted secret value, if the secret value was originally pro-
          vided as a string or through the Secrets Manager console.

          If this secret was created by using the console, then  Secrets  Man-
          ager stores the information as a JSON structure of key/value pairs.

       VersionStages -> (list)
          A  list of all of the staging labels currently attached to this ver-
          sion of the secret.

          (string)

       CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that this version of the secret  was  created.  If
          you  don't specify which version in VersionId or VersionStage , then
          Secrets Manager uses the AWSCURRENT version.
