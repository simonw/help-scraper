PUT-SECRET-VALUE()                                          PUT-SECRET-VALUE()



NAME
       put-secret-value -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new version with a new encrypted secret value and attaches it
       to the secret. The version can contain a new SecretString  value  or  a
       new SecretBinary value.

       We  recommend  you  avoid calling PutSecretValue at a sustained rate of
       more than once every 10 minutes. When you update the secret value,  Se-
       crets  Manager creates a new version of the secret. Secrets Manager re-
       moves outdated versions when there are more than 100, but it  does  not
       remove  versions created less than 24 hours ago. If you call PutSecret-
       Value more than once every 10 minutes, you create  more  versions  than
       Secrets  Manager  removes, and you will reach the quota for secret ver-
       sions.

       You can specify the staging labels to attach to the new version in Ver-
       sionStages  . If you don't include VersionStages , then Secrets Manager
       automatically moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to  this  version.  If
       this  operation  creates the first version for the secret, then Secrets
       Manager automatically attaches the staging label AWSCURRENT to it .

       If this operation moves the staging label AWSCURRENT from another  ver-
       sion to this version, then Secrets Manager also automatically moves the
       staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the version that  AWSCURRENT  was  removed
       from.

       This  operation  is  idempotent. If a version with a VersionId with the
       same value as the ClientRequestToken parameter already exists, and  you
       specify  the same secret data, the operation succeeds but does nothing.
       However, if the secret data is different, then the operation fails  be-
       cause  you  can't  modify  an existing version; you can only create new
       ones.
          Required permissions:  secretsmanager:PutSecretValue . For more  in-
          formation,   see   IAM   policy  actions  for  Secrets  Manager  and
          Authentication and access control in Secrets Manager .

SYNOPSIS
            put-secret-value
          --secret-id <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--secret-binary <value>]
          [--secret-string <value>]
          [--version-stages <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to add a new version to.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

          If the secret doesn't already exist, use CreateSecret instead.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for the new version of the secret.

          NOTE:
              If  you use the Amazon Web Services CLI or one of the Amazon Web
              Services SDKs to call this operation, then you  can  leave  this
              parameter  empty because they generate a random UUID for you. If
              you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to
              the  Secrets  Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a
              ClientRequestToken yourself for new versions  and  include  that
              value in the request.

          This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value
          to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate  versions  if  there
          are  failures  and  retries during the Lambda rotation function pro-
          cessing. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to  ensure
          uniqueness within the specified secret.

          o If  the  ClientRequestToken  value isn't already associated with a
            version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.

          o If a version with this value already exists and that version's Se-
            cretString or SecretBinary values are the same as those in the re-
            quest then the request is ignored. The operation is idempotent.

          o If a version with this value already exists and the version of the
            SecretString  and  SecretBinary values are different from those in
            the request, then the request fails because you can't modify a se-
            cret version. You can only create new versions to store new secret
            values.

          This value becomes the VersionId of the new version.

       --secret-binary (blob)
          The binary data to encrypt and store in the new version of  the  se-
          cret.  To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend
          that you store your binary data in a file and then pass the contents
          of the file as a parameter.

          You must include SecretBinary or SecretString , but not both.

          You can't access this value from the Secrets Manager console.

       --secret-string (string)
          The text to encrypt and store in the new version of the secret.

          You must include SecretBinary or SecretString , but not both.

          We  recommend  you create the secret string as JSON key/value pairs,
          as shown in the example.

       --version-stages (list)
          A list of staging labels to attach to this version  of  the  secret.
          Secrets  Manager  uses  staging labels to track versions of a secret
          through the rotation process.

          If you specify a staging label that's already associated with a dif-
          ferent  version of the same secret, then Secrets Manager removes the
          label from the other version and attaches it to this version. If you
          specify  AWSCURRENT , and it is already attached to another version,
          then Secrets Manager also moves the staging label AWSPREVIOUS to the
          version that AWSCURRENT was removed from.

          If  you don't include VersionStages , then Secrets Manager automati-
          cally moves the staging label AWSCURRENT to this version.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To store a new secret value in a secret

       The  following  put-secret-value example creates a new version of a se-
       cret with two key-value pairs.

          aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --secret-string "{\"user\":\"diegor\",\"password\":\"VCsdUbPX!bcu]N\"KEnm||:3Bp3$IBOS\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-1a2b3c",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret",
              "VersionId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSCURRENT"
              ]
          }

       Guide.

       Example 2: To store a new secret value from credentials in a JSON file

       The  following  put-secret-value example creates a new version of a se-
       cret from credentials in a file. For more information, see Loading  AWS
       CLI parameters from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager put-secret-value \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --secret-string file://mycreds.json

       Contents of mycreds.json:

          {
            "engine": "mysql",
            "username": "saanvis",
            "password": "i29wwX!%9wFV",
            "host": "my-database-endpoint.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
            "dbname": "myDatabase",
            "port": "3306"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",

              "VersionStages": [
                  "AWSCURRENT"
              ]
          }
