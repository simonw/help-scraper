       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-policy
          --secret-id <value>
          --resource-policy <value>
          [--block-public-policy | --no-block-public-policy]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --secret-id (string)
          The ARN or name of the secret to attach the resource-based policy.

          For an ARN, we recommend that you specify a complete ARN rather than
          a partial ARN.

       --resource-policy (string)
          A  JSON-formatted  string  for an Amazon Web Services resource-based
          policy. For example policies, see Permissions policy examples .

       --block-public-policy | --no-block-public-policy (boolean)
          Specifies whether to block resource-based policies that allow  broad
          access  to  the  secret. By default, Secrets Manager blocks policies
          that allow broad access, for example those that use a  wildcard  for
          the principal.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To add a resource-based policy to a secret

       The following put-resource-policy example adds a permissions policy  to
       a  secret, checking first that the policy does not provide broad access
       to the secret. The policy is read from a file.  For  more  information,
       see Loading AWS CLI parameters from a file in the AWS CLI User Guide.

          aws secretsmanager put-resource-policy \
              --secret-id MyTestSecret \
              --resource-policy file://mypolicy.json \
              --block-public-policy

       Contents of mypolicy.json:

          {
              "Version": "2012-10-17",
              "Statement": [
                  {
                      "Effect": "Allow",
                      "Principal": {
                          "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"
                      },
                      "Action": "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                      "Resource": "*"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:123456789012:secret:MyTestSecret-a1b2c3",
              "Name": "MyTestSecret"
          }

       For  more  information,  see Attach a permissions policy to a secret in
       the Secrets Manager User Guide.

OUTPUT
       ARN -> (string)
          The ARN of the secret.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the secret.
