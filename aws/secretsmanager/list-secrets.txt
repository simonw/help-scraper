LIST-SECRETS()                                                  LIST-SECRETS()



NAME
       list-secrets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the secrets that are stored by Secrets Manager in the Amazon Web
       Services account.

       To list the versions of a secret, use  ListSecretVersionIds .

       To get the secret value from SecretString or SecretBinary , call   Get-
       SecretValue .

       For  information  about  finding  secrets  in the console, see Enhanced
       search capabilities for secrets in Secrets Manager .
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have  secretsmanager:ListSecrets  permis-
       sions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-secrets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: SecretList

SYNOPSIS
            list-secrets
          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-order <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the list of secrets.

          (structure)
              Allows you to add filters when you use the  search  function  in
              Secrets  Manager.  For more information, see Find secrets in Se-
              crets Manager .

              Key -> (string)
                 The following are keys you can use:

                 o description : Prefix match, not case-sensitive.

                 o name : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o tag-key : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o tag-value : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o primary-region : Prefix match, case-sensitive.

                 o all : Breaks the filter value string into  words  and  then
                   searches all attributes for matches. Not case-sensitive.

              Values -> (list)
                 The keyword to filter for.

                 You  can prefix your search value with an exclamation mark (!
                 ) in order to perform negation filters.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "description"|"name"|"tag-key"|"tag-value"|"primary-region"|"all",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-order (string)
          Lists secrets in the requested order.

          Possible values:

          o asc

          o desc

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SecretList -> (list)
          A list of the secrets in the account.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the details about a  secret.  It  does
              not  include the encrypted SecretString and SecretBinary values.
              To get those values, use the  GetSecretValue operation.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the secret.

              Name -> (string)
                 The friendly name of the secret. You can use forward  slashes
                 in  the  name  to  represent  a  path hierarchy. For example,
                 /prod/databases/dbserver1 could represent the  secret  for  a
                 server  named dbserver1 in the folder databases in the folder
                 prod .

              Description -> (string)
                 The user-provided description of the secret.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 The ARN of the KMS key that Secrets Manager uses  to  encrypt
                 the  secret value. If the secret is encrypted with the Amazon
                 Web Services managed key aws/secretsmanager , this  field  is
                 omitted.

              RotationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  automatic,  scheduled rotation is enabled
                 for this secret.

              RotationLambdaARN -> (string)
                 The ARN of an Amazon Web Services Lambda function invoked  by
                 Secrets  Manager to rotate and expire the secret either auto-
                 matically per the schedule or manually by a call to  RotateS-
                 ecret .

              RotationRules -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that defines the rotation configuration for the
                 secret.

                 AutomaticallyAfterDays -> (long)
                     Specifies the number of days between automatic  scheduled
                     rotations of the secret.

                     Secrets Manager schedules the next rotation when the pre-
                     vious one is complete. Secrets Manager schedules the date
                     by  adding  the rotation interval (number of days) to the
                     actual date of the last rotation. The service chooses the
                     hour within that 24-hour date window randomly. The minute
                     is also chosen somewhat randomly,  but  weighted  towards
                     the  top  of the hour and influenced by a variety of fac-
                     tors that help distribute load.

              LastRotatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The most recent date and time that the Secrets Manager  rota-
                 tion  process  was successfully completed. This value is null
                 if the secret hasn't ever rotated.

              LastChangedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last date and time that this secret was modified  in  any
                 way.

              LastAccessedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  last  date  that this secret was accessed. This value is
                 truncated to midnight of the date and  therefore  shows  only
                 the date, not the time.

              DeletedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time the deletion of the secret occurred. Not
                 present on active secrets. The secret can be recovered  until
                 the  number  of  days  in  the recovery window has passed, as
                 specified  in  the  RecoveryWindowInDays  parameter  of   the
                 DeleteSecret operation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  list of user-defined tags associated with the secret. To
                 add tags to a secret, use  TagResource . To remove tags,  use
                 UntagResource .

                 (structure)
                     A structure that contains information about a tag.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key identifier, or name, of the tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The string value associated with the key of the tag.

              SecretVersionsToStages -> (map)
                 A  list  of  all of the currently assigned SecretVersionStage
                 staging labels and the SecretVersionId attached to each  one.
                 Staging  labels  are used to keep track of the different ver-
                 sions during the rotation process.

                 NOTE:
                     A version that does not have  any  SecretVersionStage  is
                     considered  deprecated and subject to deletion. Such ver-
                     sions are not included in this list.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (list)
                     (string)

              OwningService -> (string)
                 Returns the name of the service that created the secret.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when a secret was created.

              PrimaryRegion -> (string)
                 The Region where Secrets Manager originated the secret.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Secrets Manager includes this value if there's more output available
          than  what  is included in the current response. This can occur even
          when the response includes no values at all, such as  when  you  ask
          for  a  filtered  view of a long list. To get the next results, call
          ListSecrets again with this value.
