LIST-TARGETS-BY-RULE()                                  LIST-TARGETS-BY-RULE()



NAME
       list-targets-by-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the targets assigned to the specified rule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-targets-by-rule  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Targets

OPTIONS
       --rule (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display all the targets for a CloudWatch Events rule

       This example displays all the targets of the  rule  named  DailyLambda-
       Function:

          aws events list-targets-by-rule --rule  "DailyLambdaFunction"

OUTPUT
       Targets -> (list)
          The targets assigned to the rule.

          (structure)
              Targets  are  the  resources  to be invoked when a rule is trig-
              gered. For a complete list of services and resources that can be
              set as a target, see PutTargets .

              If  you are setting the event bus of another account as the tar-
              get, and that account granted permission to your account through
              an  organization instead of directly by the account ID, then you
              must specify a RoleArn with proper  permissions  in  the  Target
              structure.  For  more  information,  see  Sending  and Receiving
              Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon Event-
              Bridge User Guide .

              Id -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the target within the specified rule. Use this ID
                 to reference the target when updating the rule. We  recommend
                 using a memorable and unique string.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the target.

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to be used for
                 this target when the rule is triggered. If one rule  triggers
                 multiple  targets,  you can use a different IAM role for each
                 target.

              Input -> (string)
                 Valid JSON text passed to the target. In this  case,  nothing
                 from  the  event itself is passed to the target. For more in-
                 formation, see The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data In-
                 terchange Format .

              InputPath -> (string)
                 The value of the JSONPath that is used for extracting part of
                 the matched event when passing it to the target. You may  use
                 JSON  dot  notation or bracket notation. For more information
                 about JSON paths, see JSONPath .

              InputTransformer -> (structure)
                 Settings to enable you to provide custom input  to  a  target
                 based  on  certain  event  data.  You can extract one or more
                 key-value pairs from the event and then use that data to send
                 customized input to the target.

                 InputPathsMap -> (map)
                     Map of JSON paths to be extracted from the event. You can
                     then insert these in the  template  in  InputTemplate  to
                     produce the output you want to be sent to the target.
                        InputPathsMap  is an array key-value pairs, where each
                        value is a valid JSON path. You can have  as  many  as
                        100  key-value  pairs. You must use JSON dot notation,
                        not bracket notation.

                     The keys cannot start with "Amazon Web Services."

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 InputTemplate -> (string)
                     Input template where you specify placeholders  that  will
                     be  filled with the values of the keys from InputPathsMap
                     to customize the data sent to the  target.  Enclose  each
                     InputPathsMaps value in brackets: <value >

                     If  InputTemplate  is  a JSON object (surrounded by curly
                     braces), the following restrictions apply:

                     o The placeholder cannot be used as an object key.

                     The following example shows the syntax for  using  Input-
                     PathsMap and InputTemplate .
                        "InputTransformer":

                        {

                        "InputPathsMap":       {"instance":      "$.detail.in-
                        stance","status": "$.detail.status"},

                        "InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state <status>"

                        }

                     To have the InputTemplate include quote  marks  within  a
                     JSON  string, escape each quote marks with a slash, as in
                     the following example:
                        "InputTransformer":

                        {

                        "InputPathsMap":      {"instance":       "$.detail.in-
                        stance","status": "$.detail.status"},

                        "InputTemplate": "<instance> is in state \"<status>\""

                        }

                     The InputTemplate can also be valid JSON with varibles in
                     quotes or out, as in the following example:
                        "InputTransformer":

                        {

                        "InputPathsMap":      {"instance":       "$.detail.in-
                        stance","status": "$.detail.status"},

                        "InputTemplate":   '{"myInstance":  <instance>,"mySta-
                        tus": "<instance> is in state \"<status>\""}'

                        }

              KinesisParameters -> (structure)
                 The custom parameter you can use to control the shard assign-
                 ment, when the target is a Kinesis data stream. If you do not
                 include this parameter, the default is to use the eventId  as
                 the partition key.

                 PartitionKeyPath -> (string)
                     The  JSON path to be extracted from the event and used as
                     the partition key. For more information, see Amazon Kine-
                     sis  Streams  Key  Concepts in the Amazon Kinesis Streams
                     Developer Guide .

              RunCommandParameters -> (structure)
                 Parameters used when you are using the rule to invoke  Amazon
                 EC2 Run Command.

                 RunCommandTargets -> (list)
                     Currently, we support including only one RunCommandTarget
                     block, which specifies either an array of InstanceIds  or
                     a tag.

                     (structure)
                        Information  about  the  EC2  instances that are to be
                        sent the command, specified as key-value  pairs.  Each
                        RunCommandTarget  block  can include only one key, but
                        this key may specify multiple values.

                        Key -> (string)
                            Can be either tag:  tag-key or InstanceIds .

                        Values -> (list)
                            If Key is tag:  tag-key , Values is a list of  tag
                            values.  If  Key is InstanceIds , Values is a list
                            of Amazon EC2 instance IDs.

                            (string)

              EcsParameters -> (structure)
                 Contains the Amazon ECS task definition and task count to  be
                 used, if the event target is an Amazon ECS task. For more in-
                 formation about Amazon ECS tasks, see Task Definitions in the
                 Amazon EC2 Container Service Developer Guide .

                 TaskDefinitionArn -> (string)
                     The ARN of the task definition to use if the event target
                     is an Amazon ECS task.

                 TaskCount -> (integer)
                     The number of tasks to create based on  TaskDefinition  .
                     The default is 1.

                 LaunchType -> (string)
                     Specifies  the launch type on which your task is running.
                     The launch type that you specify here must match  one  of
                     the launch type (compatibilities) of the target task. The
                     FARGATE value is supported only in the Regions where Far-
                     gate  with Amazon ECS is supported. For more information,
                     see Fargate on Amazon ECS in the Amazon Elastic Container
                     Service Developer Guide .

                 NetworkConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Use this structure if the Amazon ECS task uses the awsvpc
                     network mode. This structure specifies  the  VPC  subnets
                     and security groups associated with the task, and whether
                     a public IP address is to be used. This structure is  re-
                     quired  if  LaunchType is FARGATE because the awsvpc mode
                     is required for Fargate tasks.

                     If you specify NetworkConfiguration when the  target  ECS
                     task  does  not  use  the  awsvpc  network mode, the task
                     fails.

                     awsvpcConfiguration -> (structure)
                        Use this structure to specify the VPC subnets and  se-
                        curity  groups  for  the task, and whether a public IP
                        address is to be used. This structure is relevant only
                        for ECS tasks that use the awsvpc network mode.

                        Subnets -> (list)
                            Specifies  the  subnets  associated with the task.
                            These subnets must all be in the same VPC. You can
                            specify as many as 16 subnets.

                            (string)

                        SecurityGroups -> (list)
                            Specifies  the security groups associated with the
                            task. These security groups must  all  be  in  the
                            same VPC. You can specify as many as five security
                            groups. If you do not specify  a  security  group,
                            the default security group for the VPC is used.

                            (string)

                        AssignPublicIp -> (string)
                            Specifies  whether  the task's elastic network in-
                            terface receives a  public  IP  address.  You  can
                            specify ENABLED only when LaunchType in EcsParame-
                            ters is set to FARGATE .

                 PlatformVersion -> (string)
                     Specifies the platform version for the task. Specify only
                     the  numeric  portion  of  the  platform version, such as
                     1.1.0 .

                     This structure is used only if LaunchType  is  FARGATE  .
                     For  more  information about valid platform versions, see
                     Fargate Platform Versions in the Amazon Elastic Container
                     Service Developer Guide .

                 Group -> (string)
                     Specifies  an  ECS  task  group for the task. The maximum
                     length is 255 characters.

                 CapacityProviderStrategy -> (list)
                     The capacity provider strategy to use for the task.

                     If   a   capacityProviderStrategy   is   specified,   the
                     launchType  parameter  must  be  omitted.  If  no capaci-
                     tyProviderStrategy or launchType is  specified,  the  de-
                     faultCapacityProviderStrategy for the cluster is used.

                     (structure)
                        The  details of a capacity provider strategy. To learn
                        more, see CapacityProviderStrategyItem in  the  Amazon
                        ECS API Reference.

                        capacityProvider -> (string)
                            The short name of the capacity provider.

                        weight -> (integer)
                            The  weight value designates the relative percent-
                            age of the total number  of  tasks  launched  that
                            should  use  the  specified capacity provider. The
                            weight value is taken into consideration after the
                            base value, if defined, is satisfied.

                        base -> (integer)
                            The  base  value  designates  how many tasks, at a
                            minimum,  to  run  on   the   specified   capacity
                            provider. Only one capacity provider in a capacity
                            provider strategy can have a base defined.  If  no
                            value  is  specified,  the  default  value of 0 is
                            used.

                 EnableECSManagedTags -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether to enable Amazon ECS managed  tags  for
                     the  task.  For more information, see Tagging Your Amazon
                     ECS Resources in the Amazon Elastic Container Service De-
                     veloper Guide.

                 EnableExecuteCommand -> (boolean)
                     Whether  or not to enable the execute command functional-
                     ity for the containers in this task. If  true,  this  en-
                     ables  execute command functionality on all containers in
                     the task.

                 PlacementConstraints -> (list)
                     An array of placement constraint objects to use  for  the
                     task.  You can specify up to 10 constraints per task (in-
                     cluding constraints in  the  task  definition  and  those
                     specified at runtime).

                     (structure)
                        An object representing a constraint on task placement.
                        To learn more, see Task Placement Constraints  in  the
                        Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

                        type -> (string)
                            The  type  of  constraint. Use distinctInstance to
                            ensure that each task in  a  particular  group  is
                            running  on  a  different  container instance. Use
                            memberOf to restrict the selection to a  group  of
                            valid candidates.

                        expression -> (string)
                            A  cluster  query  language expression to apply to
                            the constraint. You cannot specify  an  expression
                            if  the  constraint  type is distinctInstance . To
                            learn more, see Cluster Query Language in the Ama-
                            zon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.

                 PlacementStrategy -> (list)
                     The  placement  strategy objects to use for the task. You
                     can specify a maximum of five strategy rules per task.

                     (structure)
                        The task placement strategy for a task or service.  To
                        learn  more, see Task Placement Strategies in the Ama-
                        zon Elastic Container Service Service Developer Guide.

                        type -> (string)
                            The type of placement strategy. The random  place-
                            ment  strategy  randomly places tasks on available
                            candidates. The spread placement strategy  spreads
                            placement across available candidates evenly based
                            on  the  field  parameter.  The  binpack  strategy
                            places tasks on available candidates that have the
                            least available amount of  the  resource  that  is
                            specified  with  the field parameter. For example,
                            if you binpack on memory, a task is placed on  the
                            instance with the least amount of remaining memory
                            (but still enough to run the task).

                        field -> (string)
                            The field to apply the placement strategy against.
                            For  the  spread  placement strategy, valid values
                            are instanceId (or host, which has  the  same  ef-
                            fect), or any platform or custom attribute that is
                            applied to a container instance,  such  as  attri-
                            bute:ecs.availability-zone. For the binpack place-
                            ment strategy, valid values are  cpu  and  memory.
                            For  the  random placement strategy, this field is
                            not used.

                 PropagateTags -> (string)
                     Specifies whether to propagate the  tags  from  the  task
                     definition  to  the  task.  If no value is specified, the
                     tags are not propagated. Tags can only be  propagated  to
                     the  task during task creation. To add tags to a task af-
                     ter task creation, use the TagResource API action.

                 ReferenceId -> (string)
                     The reference ID to use for the task.

                 Tags -> (list)
                     The metadata that you apply to the task to help you cate-
                     gorize  and organize them. Each tag consists of a key and
                     an optional value, both of which  you  define.  To  learn
                     more, see RunTask in the Amazon ECS API Reference.

                        Key -> (string)
                            A string you can use to assign a value. The combi-
                            nation of tag keys and values can help  you  orga-
                            nize and categorize your resources.

                        Value -> (string)

                     The array properties for the submitted job, such  as  the
                     size  of  the  array. The array size can be between 2 and
                     10,000. If you specify array properties for a job, it be-
                     comes  an  array  job. This parameter is used only if the
                     target is an Batch job.

                     Size -> (integer)
                        The size of the array, if this is an array batch  job.
                        Valid values are integers between 2 and 10,000.

                 RetryStrategy -> (structure)
                     The  retry strategy to use for failed jobs, if the target
                     is an Batch job. The retry  strategy  is  the  number  of
                     times to retry the failed job execution. Valid values are
                     110. When you specify a retry strategy here, it overrides
                     the retry strategy defined in the job definition.

                     Attempts -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  times to attempt to retry, if the job

                 If  you specify an API Gateway API or EventBridge ApiDestina-
                 tion as a target, you can use this parameter to specify head-
                 ers, path parameters, and query string keys/values as part of
                 your target invoking request.  If  you're  using  ApiDestina-
                 tions,  the corresponding Connection can also have these val-
                 ues configured. In case of any conflicting keys, values  from
                 the Connection take precedence.

                 PathParameterValues -> (list)
                     The  path  parameter  values  to  be used to populate API
                     Gateway API or EventBridge ApiDestination path  wildcards
