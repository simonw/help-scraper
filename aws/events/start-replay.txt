START-REPLAY()                                                  START-REPLAY()



NAME
       start-replay -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the
       exact same order that they were added to the  archive.  A  replay  pro-
       cesses  events  to  replay  based on the time in the event, and replays
       them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an EventStartTime and  an
       EventEndTime  that  covers  a  20 minute time range, the events are re-
       played from the first minute of that 20 minute range  first.  Then  the
       events  from the second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay
       to determine the progress of a replay. The value returned for EventLas-
       tReplayedTime  indicates the time within the specified time range asso-
       ciated with the last event replayed.

SYNOPSIS
            start-replay
          --replay-name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --event-source-arn <value>
          --event-start-time <value>
          --event-end-time <value>
          --destination <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replay-name (string)
          The name of the replay to start.

       --description (string)
          A description for the replay to start.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the archive to replay events from.

       --event-start-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to start  replaying  events.  Only  events
          that  occurred  between  the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are re-
          played.

       --event-end-time (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time to stop replaying events. Only events that
          occurred between the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are replayed.

       --destination (structure)
          A  ReplayDestination object that includes details about the destina-
          tion for the replay.

          Arn -> (string)
              The ARN of the event bus to replay  event  to.  You  can  replay
              events only to the event bus specified to create the archive.

          FilterArns -> (list)
              A list of ARNs for rules to replay events to.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Arn=string,FilterArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Arn": "string",
            "FilterArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ReplayArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the replay.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the replay.

       StateReason -> (string)
          The reason that the replay is in the state.

       ReplayStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time at which the replay started.
