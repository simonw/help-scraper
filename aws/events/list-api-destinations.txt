NAME
       list-api-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of API destination in the account in the current Re-
       gion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-api-destinations
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--connection-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A name prefix to filter results returned. Only API destinations with
          a name that starts with the prefix are returned.

       --connection-arn (string)
          The ARN of the connection specified for the API destination.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  returned  by a previous call to retrieve the next set of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of API destinations to include in the response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
