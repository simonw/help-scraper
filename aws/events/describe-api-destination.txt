NAME
       describe-api-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves details about an API destination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-api-destination
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the API destination to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApiDestinationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the API destination retrieved.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the API destination retrieved.

       Description -> (string)
          The description for the API destination retrieved.

       ApiDestinationState -> (string)
          The state of the API destination retrieved.

       ConnectionArn -> (string)
          The  ARN  of  the  connection  specified for the API destination re-
          trieved.

       InvocationEndpoint -> (string)
          The URL to use to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

       HttpMethod -> (string)
          The method to use to connect to the HTTP endpoint.

       InvocationRateLimitPerSecond -> (integer)
          The maximum number of invocations per second to  specified  for  the
          API destination. Note that if you set the invocation rate maximum to
          a value lower the rate necessary to send all events received  on  to
          the  destination  HTTP  endpoint,  some  events may not be delivered
          within the 24-hour retry window. If you plan to set the  rate  lower
          than  the  rate  necessary  to  deliver all events, consider using a
          dead-letter queue to catch events that are not delivered  within  24
          hours.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A time stamp for the time that the API destination was created.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A  time  stamp  for the time that the API destination was last modi-
          fied.
