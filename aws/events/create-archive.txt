CREATE-ARCHIVE()                                              CREATE-ARCHIVE()



NAME
       create-archive -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an archive of events with the specified settings. When you cre-
       ate an archive, incoming events might not immediately start being  sent
       to  the  archive.  Allow a short period of time for changes to take ef-
       fect. If you do not specify a pattern to filter events sent to the  ar-
       chive,  all  events are sent to the archive except replayed events. Re-
       played events are not sent to an archive.

SYNOPSIS
            create-archive
          --archive-name <value>
          --event-source-arn <value>
          [--description <value>]
          [--event-pattern <value>]
          [--retention-days <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --archive-name (string)
          The name for the archive to create.

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the event bus that sends events to the archive.

       --description (string)
          A description for the archive.

       --event-pattern (string)
          An event pattern to use to filter events sent to the archive.

       --retention-days (integer)
          The number of days to retain events for. Default value is 0. If  set
          to 0, events are retained indefinitely

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       State -> (string)
          The state of the archive that was created.

       StateReason -> (string)
