       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-api-destination
          --name <value>
          [--description <value>]
          --connection-arn <value>
          --invocation-endpoint <value>
          --http-method <value>
          [--invocation-rate-limit-per-second <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the API destination to create.

       --description (string)
          A description for the API destination to create.

       --connection-arn (string)
          The ARN of the connection to use for the API destination. The desti-
          nation  endpoint  must  support the authorization type specified for
          the connection.

       --invocation-endpoint (string)
          The URL to the HTTP invocation endpoint for the API destination.

       --http-method (string)
          The method to use for the request to the HTTP invocation endpoint.

          Possible values:

          o POST

          o GET

          o HEAD

          o OPTIONS

          o PUT

          o PATCH

          o DELETE

       --invocation-rate-limit-per-second (integer)
          The maximum number of requests per second to send to the HTTP  invo-
          cation endpoint.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ApiDestinationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the API destination that was created by the request.

       ApiDestinationState -> (string)
          The state of the API destination that was created by the request.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          A  time  stamp indicating the time that the API destination was cre-
          ated.

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          A time stamp indicating the time that the API destination  was  last
          modified.
