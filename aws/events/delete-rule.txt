DELETE-RULE()                                                    DELETE-RULE()



NAME
       delete-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified rule.

       Before  you  can  delete  the  rule, you must remove all targets, using
       RemoveTargets .

       When you delete a rule, incoming events might continue to match to  the
       deleted rule. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.

       If  you  call  delete  rule multiple times for the same rule, all calls
       will succeed. When you call  delete  rule  for  a  non-existent  custom
       eventbus, ResourceNotFoundException is returned.

       Managed  rules are rules created and managed by another Amazon Web Ser-
       vices service on your behalf. These rules are created  by  those  other
       Amazon  Web  Services  services  to support functionality in those ser-
       vices. You can delete these rules  using  the  Force  option,  but  you
       should  do so only if you are sure the other service is not still using
       that rule.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-rule
          --name <value>
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the rule.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the  rule.  If  you
          omit this, the default event bus is used.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service
          on your behalf, you must specify Force as True to delete  the  rule.
          This  parameter is ignored for rules that are not managed rules. You
          can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using DescribeRule  or
          ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
