DESCRIBE-REPLAY()                                            DESCRIBE-REPLAY()



NAME
       describe-replay -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about a replay. Use DescribeReplay to determine the
       progress of a running replay. A replay processes events to replay based
       on the time in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If
       you use StartReplay and specify an EventStartTime and  an  EventEndTime
       that  covers  a  20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the
       first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the  events  from  the
       second minute are replayed. You can use DescribeReplay to determine the
       progress of a replay. The value returned for EventLastReplayedTime  in-
       dicates  the  time  within the specified time range associated with the
       last event replayed.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-replay
          --replay-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --replay-name (string)
          The name of the replay to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
