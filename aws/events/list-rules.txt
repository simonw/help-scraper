LIST-RULES()                                                      LIST-RULES()



NAME
       list-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your Amazon EventBridge rules. You can either list all the rules
       or you can provide a prefix to match to the rule names.

       ListRules does not list the targets of a rule. To see the targets asso-
       ciated with a rule, use ListTargetsByRule .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-rules  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Rules

SYNOPSIS
            list-rules
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--event-bus-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          The prefix matching the rule name.

       --event-bus-name (string)
          The name or ARN of the event bus to list the rules for. If you  omit
          this, the default event bus is used.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display a list of all CloudWatch Events rules

       This example displays all CloudWatch Events rules in the region:

          aws events list-rules

       To display a list of CloudWatch Events rules beginning with  a  certain
       string.

       This  example  displays  all CloudWatch Events rules in the region that
       have a name starting with "Daily":

          aws events list-rules --name-prefix "Daily"

OUTPUT
       Rules -> (list)
          The rules that match the specified criteria.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a rule in Amazon EventBridge.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule.

              EventPattern -> (string)
                 The event pattern of the  rule.  For  more  information,  see
                 Events  and  Event  Patterns  in  the Amazon EventBridge User
                 Guide .

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the rule.

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The scheduling expression. For example, "cron(0 20 * * ?
                 *
                 )", "rate(5 minutes)". For more information, see Creating  an
                 Amazon EventBridge rule that runs on a schedule .

              RoleArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the role that is used for
                 target invocation.

                 If you're setting an event bus in another account as the tar-
                 get  and  that  account  granted  permission  to your account
                 through an organization instead of directly  by  the  account
                 ID, you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the
                 Target structure, instead of here in this parameter.

              ManagedBy -> (string)
                 If the rule was created on behalf of your account by an  Ama-
                 zon  Web  Services service, this field displays the principal
                 name of the service that created the rule.

              EventBusName -> (string)
                 The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If
                 you omit this, the default event bus is used.

       NextToken -> (string)
          Indicates whether there are additional results to retrieve. If there
          are no more results, the value is null.
