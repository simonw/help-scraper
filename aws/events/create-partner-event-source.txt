CREATE-PARTNER-EVENT-SOURCE()                    CREATE-PARTNER-EVENT-SOURCE()



NAME
       create-partner-event-source -

DESCRIPTION
       Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This opera-
       tion is not used by Amazon Web Services customers.

       Each partner event source can be used by one Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
       count  to  create  a matching partner event bus in that Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source  for
       each  Amazon  Web  Services  account  that wants to receive those event
       types.

       A partner event source creates events based  on  resources  within  the
       SaaS partner's service or application.

       An  Amazon  Web  Services account that creates a partner event bus that
       matches the partner event source can use  that  event  bus  to  receive
       events  from  the  partner, and then process them using Amazon Web Ser-
       vices Events rules and targets.

       Partner event source names follow this format:
          `` partner_name /event_namespace /event_name ``

          partner_name is determined during partner registration  and  identi-
          fies  the  partner to Amazon Web Services customers. event_namespace
          is determined by the partner and is a way for the partner to catego-
          rize  their  events.  event_name  is  determined by the partner, and
          should uniquely identify an  event-generating  resource  within  the
          partner  system.  The  combination of event_namespace and event_name
          should help Amazon Web Services customers decide whether  to  create
          an event bus to receive these events.

SYNOPSIS
            create-partner-event-source
          --name <value>
          --account <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The  name  of the partner event source. This name must be unique and
          must be in the format `` partner_name  /event_namespace  /event_name
          ``  . The Amazon Web Services account that wants to use this partner
          event source must create a  partner  event  bus  with  a  name  that
          matches the name of the partner event source.

       --account (string)
          The  Amazon  Web  Services  account ID that is permitted to create a
          matching partner event bus for this partner event source.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EventSourceArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the partner event source.
