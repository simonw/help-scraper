NAME
       list-replays -

SYNOPSIS
            list-replays
          [--name-prefix <value>]
          [--state <value>]
          [--event-source-arn <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name-prefix (string)
          A name prefix to filter the replays returned. Only replays with name
          that match the prefix are returned.

       --state (string)
          The state of the replay.

          Possible values:

          o STARTING

          o RUNNING

          o CANCELLING

          o COMPLETED

          o CANCELLED

          o FAILED

       --event-source-arn (string)
          The ARN of the archive from which the events are replayed.

       --next-token (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
          results.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of replays to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Replays -> (list)

              ReplayName -> (string)

              StateReason -> (string)
                 A description of why the replay is in the current state.

              EventStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  time stamp for the time to start replaying events. This is
                 determined by the time in the event as described in Time .

              EventEndTime -> (timestamp)

              ReplayEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 A time stamp for the time that the replay completed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token returned by a previous call to retrieve the  next  set  of
