SYNOPSIS
            upgrade-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          --target-version <value>
          [--perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only]
          [--advanced-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --target-version (string)
          The version of OpenSearch you intend to upgrade the domain to.

       --perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only (boolean)
          When  true,  indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs to be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       --advanced-options (map)
          Exposes  select  native   OpenSearch   configuration   values   from
          opensearch.yml  .  Currently,  the  following  advanced  options are
          available:

          o Option to allow references to indices in  an  HTTP  request  body.
            Must be false when configuring access to individual sub-resources.
            By default, the value is true . See  Advanced  cluster  parameters
            for more information.

          o Option  to specify the percentage of heap space allocated to field
            data. By default, this setting is unbounded.

          For more information, see Advanced cluster parameters .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       UpgradeId -> (string)

       DomainName -> (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       TargetVersion -> (string)
          The version of OpenSearch that you intend to upgrade the domain to.

       PerformCheckOnly -> (boolean)
          When  true,  indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs to be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       AdvancedOptions -> (map)
          Exposes  select  native   OpenSearch   configuration   values   from
          opensearch.yml  .  Currently,  the  following  advanced  options are
