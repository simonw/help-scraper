SYNOPSIS
            upgrade-domain
          --domain-name <value>
          --target-version <value>
          [--perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only]
          [--advanced-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain-name (string)
          The name of an domain. Domain names are unique  across  the  domains
          owned  by an account within an AWS region. Domain names start with a
          letter or number and can contain the following characters: a-z (low-
          ercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

       --target-version (string)
          The version of OpenSearch you intend to upgrade the domain to.

       --perform-check-only | --no-perform-check-only (boolean)
          When  true,  indicates that an upgrade eligibility check needs to be
          performed. Does not actually perform the upgrade.

       --advanced-options (map)
          Exposes  select  native   OpenSearch   configuration   values   from
          opensearch.yml  .  Currently,  the  following  advanced  options are
          available:

          o Option to allow references to indices in  an  HTTP  request  body.
            Must be false when configuring access to individual sub-resources.
            By default, the value is true . See  Advanced  cluster  parameters
            for more information.

          o Option  to specify the percentage of heap space allocated to field
            data. By default, this setting is unbounded.

          For more information, see Advanced cluster parameters .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
