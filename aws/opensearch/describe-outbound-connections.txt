NAME
       describe-outbound-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the outbound cross-cluster connections for a local domain.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-outbound-connections
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          A  list of filters used to match properties for outbound cross-clus-
          ter connections. Available ``  Filter `` names  for  this  operation
          are:

          o connection-id

          o remote-domain-info.domain-name

          o remote-domain-info.owner-id

          o remote-domain-info.region

          o local-domain-info.domain-name

          (structure)
              A  filter  used to limit results when describing inbound or out-
              bound cross-cluster connections. Multiple values can  be  speci-
              fied  per filter. A cross-cluster connection must match at least
              one of the specified values for it to be returned from an opera-
              tion.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 Contains one or more values for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          Set this value to limit the number of results returned. If not spec-
          ified, defaults to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          NextToken is sent in case the earlier API call results  contain  the
          NextToken parameter. Used for pagination.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
