OPTIONS
       --local-domain-info (structure)
          The ``  AWSDomainInformation `` for the local OpenSearch domain.

          AWSDomainInformation -> (structure)
              OwnerId -> (string)

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The name of an domain. Domain names are unique across the do-

              Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AWSDomainInformation={OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AWSDomainInformation": {
              "OwnerId": "string",
              "DomainName": "string",
              "Region": "string"
            }
          }

       --remote-domain-info (structure)
          The ``  AWSDomainInformation `` for the remote OpenSearch domain.

          AWSDomainInformation -> (structure)
              OwnerId -> (string)

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The name of an domain. Domain names are unique across the do-
                 mains owned by an account within an AWS region. Domain  names
                 start  with  a letter or number and can contain the following
                 characters: a-z (lowercase), 0-9, and - (hyphen).

              Region -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AWSDomainInformation={OwnerId=string,DomainName=string,Region=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AWSDomainInformation": {
              "OwnerId": "string",
              "DomainName": "string",
              "Region": "string"
            }
          }

       --connection-alias (string)
          The connection alias used used by the customer for this  cross-clus-
          ter connection.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
