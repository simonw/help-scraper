LIST-CHANNELS()                                                LIST-CHANNELS()



NAME
       list-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of channels that are associated with this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-channels  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-channels
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Items -> (list)
          An array of channels that are associated with this account.

          (structure)
              The configuration parameters for a channel.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the channel.

              ChannelName -> (string)
                 The name of the channel.

              ChannelState -> (string)

                 You must configure filler slate if your channel uses the LIN-
                 EAR PlaybackMode. MediaTailor doesn't  support  filler  slate
                 for channels using the LOOP PlaybackMode.

                 VodSourceName -> (string)
                     The slate VOD source name. The VOD  source  must  already
                     exist  in  a  source  location  before it can be used for
                     slate.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of when the channel was last modified.

                 (structure)

                            Minimum  value:  2 seconds. Maximum value: 60 sec-
                            onds.

                            Minimum amount  of  time  (in  seconds)  that  the
                            player  should  wait  before requesting updates to
                            the manifest. Minimum value:  2  seconds.  Maximum
                            value: 60 seconds.
