NAME
       describe-program -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the properties of the requested program.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-program
          --channel-name <value>
          --program-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The identifier for the channel you are working on.

       --program-name (string)
          The identifier for the program you are working on.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AdBreaks -> (list)
          The ad break configuration settings.

          (structure)
              Ad break configuration parameters.

              MessageType -> (string)
                 The SCTE-35 ad insertion type. Accepted value: SPLICE_INSERT.

              OffsetMillis -> (long)
                 How long (in milliseconds) after the beginning of the program
                 that  an  ad  starts.  This value must fall within 100ms of a
                 segment boundary, otherwise the ad break will be skipped.

              Slate -> (structure)
                 Ad break slate configuration.

                 SourceLocationName -> (string)
                     The name of the  source  location  where  the  slate  VOD
                     source is stored.

                 VodSourceName -> (string)
                     The  slate  VOD  source name. The VOD source must already
                     exist in a source location before  it  can  be  used  for
                     slate.

              SpliceInsertMessage -> (structure)
                 This  defines  the  SCTE-35  splice_insert() message inserted
                 around the ad. For information about  using  splice_insert(),
                 see the SCTE-35 specficiaiton, section 9.7.3.1.

                 AvailNum -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.avail_num, as defined in
                     section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification. The default
                     value is 0. Values must be between 0 and 256, inclusive.

                 AvailsExpected -> (integer)
                     This  is written to splice_insert.avails_expected, as de-
                     fined in section 9.7.3.1 of  the  SCTE-35  specification.
                     The default value is 0. Values must be between 0 and 256,
                     inclusive.

                 SpliceEventId -> (integer)
                     This is written to splice_insert.splice_event_id, as  de-
                     fined  in  section  9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification.
                     The default value is 1.

                 UniqueProgramId -> (integer)
                     This is written  to  splice_insert.unique_program_id,  as
                     defined  in section 9.7.3.1 of the SCTE-35 specification.
                     The default value is 0. Values must be between 0 and 256,
                     inclusive.

       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the program.

       ChannelName -> (string)
          The name of the channel that the program belongs to.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp of when the program was created.

       LiveSourceName -> (string)
          The name of the LiveSource for this Program.

       ProgramName -> (string)
          The name of the program.

       ScheduledStartTime -> (timestamp)
          The date and time that the program is scheduled to start in ISO 8601
          format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, the  value
          2021-03-27T17:48:16.751Z  represents  March 27, 2021 at 17:48:16.751
          UTC.

       SourceLocationName -> (string)
          The source location name.

       VodSourceName -> (string)
          The name that's used to refer to a VOD source.
