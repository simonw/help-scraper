DESCRIBE-SOURCE-LOCATION()                          DESCRIBE-SOURCE-LOCATION()



NAME
       describe-source-location -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the properties of the requested source location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-source-location
          --source-location-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-location-name (string)
          The identifier for the source location you are working on.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AccessConfiguration -> (structure)
          The access configuration for the source location.

          AccessType -> (string)
              The  type of authentication used to access content from HttpCon-
              figuration::BaseUrl on your  source  location.  Accepted  value:
              S3_SIGV4.

              S3_SIGV4  - AWS Signature Version 4 authentication for Amazon S3
              hosted virtual-style access. If your source location base URL is
              an Amazon S3 bucket, MediaTailor can use AWS Signature Version 4
              (SigV4) authentication to access the bucket  where  your  source
              content is stored. Your MediaTailor source location baseURL must
              follow the S3 virtual hosted-style request URL format. For exam-
              ple, https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.

              Before you can use S3_SIGV4, you must meet these requirements:

              o You  must allow MediaTailor to access your S3 bucket by grant-
                ing mediatailor.amazonaws.com principal access in IAM. For in-
                formation  about configuring access in IAM, see Access manage-
                ment in the IAM User Guide.

              o The mediatailor.amazonaws.com service principal must have per-
                missions  to  read  all  top level manifests referenced by the
                VodSource packaging configurations.

              o The caller of the API must have s3:GetObject  IAM  permissions
                to read all top level manifests referenced by your MediaTailor
                VodSource packaging configurations.

          SecretsManagerAccessTokenConfiguration -> (structure)
              AWS Secrets Manager access token configuration parameters.

              HeaderName -> (string)
                 The name of the HTTP header used to supply the  access  token
                 in requests to the source location.

              SecretArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Secrets Manager se-
                 cret that contains the access token.

              SecretStringKey -> (string)
                 The AWS Secrets Manager SecretString key associated with  the
                 access  token.  MediaTailor  uses  the key to look up Secret-
                 String key and value pair containing the access token.

       Arn -> (string)
          The ARN of the source location.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp that indicates when the source location was created.

       DefaultSegmentDeliveryConfiguration -> (structure)
          The default segment delivery configuration settings.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The hostname of the server that will be used to serve  segments.
              This string must include the protocol, such as https:// .

       HttpConfiguration -> (structure)
          The HTTP package configuration settings for the source location.

          BaseUrl -> (string)
              The  base  URL  for the source location host server. This string
              must include the protocol, such as https:// .

       LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
          The timestamp that indicates when the source location was last modi-
          fied.

       SegmentDeliveryConfigurations -> (list)
          (structure)
              BaseUrl -> (string)

              Name -> (string)

       SourceLocationName -> (string)
          The name of the source location.

       Tags -> (map)
          The tags assigned to the source location.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
