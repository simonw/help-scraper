LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()                            LIST-PREFETCH-SCHEDULES()



NAME
       list-prefetch-schedules -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new prefetch schedule.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-prefetch-schedules  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-prefetch-schedules
          --playback-configuration-name <value>
          [--stream-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --playback-configuration-name (string)
          The name of the playback configuration.

       --stream-id (string)
          An optional filtering  parameter  whereby  MediaTailor  filters  the
          prefetch schedules to include only specific streams.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Items -> (list)
          Lists the prefetch schedules. An empty Items list doesn't mean there
          aren't more items to fetch, just that that page was empty.

          (structure)
              A complex type that contains prefetch schedule information.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the prefetch schedule.

              Consumption -> (structure)
                 Consumption settings determine  how,  and  when,  MediaTailor
                 places  the prefetched ads into ad breaks. Ad consumption oc-
                 curs within a span of time that you define, called a consump-
                 tion  window  .  You can designate which ad breaks that Medi-
                 aTailor fills with prefetch ads  by  setting  avail  matching
                 criteria.

                 AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
                     If  you  only  want  MediaTailor to insert prefetched ads
                     into avails (ad breaks) that match specific dynamic vari-
                     ables, such as scte.event_id, set the avail matching cri-
                     teria.

                     (structure)
                        MediaTailor only places (consumes) prefetched  ads  if
                        the ad break meets the criteria defined by the dynamic
                        variables. This gives you granular control over  which
                        ad break to place the prefetched ads into.

                        As  an example, let's say that you set DynamicVariable
                        to scte.event_id and  Operator  to  EQUALS,  and  your
                        playback    configuration    has   an   ADS   URL   of
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs].
                        And  the  prefetch  request  to the ADS contains these
                        values
                        https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30.
                        MediaTailor will only insert the prefetched  ads  into
                        the  ad break if has a SCTE marker with an event id of
                        my-awesome-event, since it must  match  the  event  id
                        that MediaTailor uses to query the ADS.

                        You  can  specify up to five AvailMatchingCriteria. If
                        you specify multiple AvailMatchingCriteria,  MediaTai-
                        lor  combines  them  to match using a logical AND. You
                        can model logical OR combinations by creating multiple
                        prefetch schedules.

                        DynamicVariable -> (string)
                            The  dynamic  variable(s)  that MediaTailor should
                            use as avail matching criteria.  MediaTailor  only
                            places  the  prefetched  ads into the avail if the
                            avail matches the criteria defined by the  dynamic
                            variable. For information about dynamic variables,
                            see Using dynamic ad variables in the  MediaTailor
                            User Guide .

                            You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.

                        Operator -> (string)
                            For  the  DynamicVariable specified in AvailMatch-
                            ingCriteria, the Operator that  is  used  for  the
                            comparison.

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The   time  when  MediaTailor  no  longer  considers  the
                     prefetched ads for use in an ad break. MediaTailor  auto-
                     matically  deletes  prefetch schedules no less than seven
                     days after the end time. If you'd like to manually delete
                     the  prefetch schedule, you can call DeletePrefetchSched-
                     ule.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetched ads are considered for use in an
                     ad  break. If you don't specify StartTime, the prefetched
                     ads are available after MediaTailor  retrives  them  from
                     the ad decision server.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the prefetch schedule. The name must be unique
                 among all prefetch schedules that  are  associated  with  the
                 specified playback configuration.

              PlaybackConfigurationName -> (string)
                 The name of the playback configuration to create the prefetch
                 schedule for.

              Retrieval -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains settings for prefetch  retrieval
                 from the ad decision server (ADS).

                 DynamicVariables -> (map)
                     The  dynamic  variables  to  use  for substitution during
                     prefetch requests to the ad decision server (ADS).

                     You intially configure dynamic variables for the ADS  URL
                     when  you  set  up  your playback configuration. When you
                     specify DynamicVariables for  prefetch  retrieval,  Medi-
                     aTailor  includes the dynamic variables in the request to
                     the ADS.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (string)

                 EndTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetch retrieval ends for the  ad  break.
                     Prefetching  will be attempted for manifest requests that
                     occur at or before this time.

                 StartTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time when prefetch  retrievals  can  start  for  this
                     break.  Ad prefetching will be attempted for manifest re-
                     quests that occur at or after this time. Defaults to  the
                     current  time.  If  not specified, the prefetch retrieval
                     starts as soon as possible.

              StreamId -> (string)
                 An optional stream identifier that you can specify  in  order
                 to  prefetch  for multiple streams that use the same playback
                 configuration.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The value that you will use forNextToken in the  next  ListPrefetch-
          SchedulesRequest request.
