       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-prefetch-schedule
          --consumption <value>
          --name <value>
          --playback-configuration-name <value>
          --retrieval <value>
          [--stream-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --consumption (structure)
          The configuration settings  for  MediaTailor's  consumption  of  the
          prefetched ads from the ad decision server. Each consumption config-
          uration contains an end time and an optional start time that  define
          the  consumption window . Prefetch schedules automatically expire no
          earlier than seven days after the end time.

          AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
              If you only want  MediaTailor  to  insert  prefetched  ads  into
              avails  (ad  breaks) that match specific dynamic variables, such
              as scte.event_id, set the avail matching criteria.

              (structure)
                 MediaTailor only places (consumes) prefetched ads if  the  ad
                 break  meets  the  criteria defined by the dynamic variables.
                 This gives you granular control over which ad break to  place
                 the prefetched ads into.

                 As  an  example,  let's  say  that you set DynamicVariable to
                 scte.event_id and Operator to EQUALS, and your playback  con-
                 figuration        has        an        ADS       URL       of
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs].
                 And  the  prefetch  request  to the ADS contains these values
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30.
                 MediaTailor  will  only insert the prefetched ads into the ad
                 break if has a SCTE  marker  with  an  event  id  of  my-awe-
                 some-event, since it must match the event id that MediaTailor
                 uses to query the ADS.

                 You can specify up  to  five  AvailMatchingCriteria.  If  you
                 specify  multiple AvailMatchingCriteria, MediaTailor combines
                 them to match using a logical AND. You can model  logical  OR
                 combinations by creating multiple prefetch schedules.

                 DynamicVariable -> (string)
                     The  dynamic  variable(s)  that MediaTailor should use as
                     avail matching  criteria.  MediaTailor  only  places  the
                     prefetched  ads  into  the avail if the avail matches the
                     criteria defined by the dynamic variable. For information
                     about  dynamic  variables, see Using dynamic ad variables
                     in the MediaTailor User Guide .

                     You can include up to 100 dynamic variables.

                 Operator -> (string)
                     For the DynamicVariable specified in  AvailMatchingCrite-
                     ria, the Operator that is used for the comparison.

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when MediaTailor no longer considers the prefetched ads
              for use  in  an  ad  break.  MediaTailor  automatically  deletes
              prefetch  schedules  no less than seven days after the end time.
              If you'd like to manually delete the prefetch schedule, you  can
              call DeletePrefetchSchedule.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  prefetched  ads are considered for use in an ad
              break. If you don't specify StartTime, the  prefetched  ads  are
              available  after  MediaTailor retrives them from the ad decision
              server.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AvailMatchingCriteria=[{DynamicVariable=string,Operator=string},{DynamicVariable=string,Operator=string}],EndTime=timestamp,StartTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AvailMatchingCriteria": [
              {
                "DynamicVariable": "string",
                "Operator": "EQUALS"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "EndTime": timestamp,
            "StartTime": timestamp
          }

       --name (string)
          The identifier for the playback configuration.

       --playback-configuration-name (string)
          The name of the playback configuration.

       --retrieval (structure)
          The configuration settings for retrieval of prefetched ads from  the
          ad decision server. Only one set of prefetched ads will be retrieved
          and subsequently consumed for each ad break.

          DynamicVariables -> (map)
              The dynamic variables to use for  substitution  during  prefetch
              requests to the ad decision server (ADS).

              You  intially  configure  dynamic variables for the ADS URL when
              you set up your playback configuration. When you specify  Dynam-
              icVariables for prefetch retrieval, MediaTailor includes the dy-
              namic variables in the request to the ADS.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          EndTime -> (timestamp)
              The  time  when  prefetch  retrieval  ends  for  the  ad  break.
              Prefetching  will  be attempted for manifest requests that occur
              at or before this time.

          StartTime -> (timestamp)
              The time when prefetch retrievals can start for this  break.  Ad
              prefetching  will  be attempted for manifest requests that occur
              at or after this time. Defaults to  the  current  time.  If  not
              specified, the prefetch retrieval starts as soon as possible.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DynamicVariables={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},EndTime=timestamp,StartTime=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "DynamicVariables": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "EndTime": timestamp,
            "StartTime": timestamp
          }

       --stream-id (string)
          An  optional stream identifier that MediaTailor uses to prefetch ads
          for multiple streams that use the same  playback  configuration.  If
          StreamId  is  specified,  MediaTailor  returns  all  of the prefetch
          schedules with an exact match on StreamId. If not  specified,  Medi-
          aTailor  returns all of the prefetch schedules for the playback con-
          figuration, regardless of StreamId.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the prefetch schedule.

       Consumption -> (structure)
          Consumption settings determine how, and when, MediaTailor places the
          prefetched ads into ad breaks. Ad consumption occurs within  a  span
          of  time that you define, called a consumption window . You can des-
          ignate which ad breaks that MediaTailor fills with prefetch  ads  by
          setting avail matching criteria.

          AvailMatchingCriteria -> (list)
              If  you  only  want  MediaTailor  to  insert prefetched ads into
              avails (ad breaks) that match specific dynamic  variables,  such
              as scte.event_id, set the avail matching criteria.

              (structure)
                 MediaTailor  only  places (consumes) prefetched ads if the ad
                 break meets the criteria defined by  the  dynamic  variables.
                 This  gives you granular control over which ad break to place
                 the prefetched ads into.

                 scte.event_id  and Operator to EQUALS, and your playback con-
                 figuration       has       an        ADS        URL        of
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=[scte.avail_num]&event=[scte.event_id]&duration=[session.avail_duration_secs].
                 And the prefetch request to the  ADS  contains  these  values
                 https://my.ads.server.com/path?&podId=3&event=my-awesome-event&duration=30.
                 MediaTailor will only insert the prefetched ads into  the  ad
                 break  if  has  a  SCTE  marker  with  an event id of my-awe-
                 some-event, since it must match the event id that MediaTailor
                 uses to query the ADS.

                 You  can  specify  up  to  five AvailMatchingCriteria. If you
                 specify multiple AvailMatchingCriteria, MediaTailor  combines
                 them  to  match using a logical AND. You can model logical OR
                 combinations by creating multiple prefetch schedules.

                 DynamicVariable -> (string)
                     The dynamic variable(s) that MediaTailor  should  use  as
                     avail  matching  criteria.  MediaTailor  only  places the
                     prefetched ads into the avail if the  avail  matches  the
                     criteria defined by the dynamic variable. For information
                     about dynamic variables, see Using dynamic  ad  variables
                     in the MediaTailor User Guide .

              server.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the prefetch schedule. The name must be unique among all
          prefetch schedules that are associated with the  specified  playback
