OPTIONS
       --channel-name (string)
          The identifier for the channel you are working on.

       --filler-slate (structure)
          The  slate  used  to fill gaps between programs in the schedule. You
          must configure filler slate if your channel uses  the  LINEAR  Play-
          backMode.  MediaTailor doesn't support filler slate for channels us-
          ing the LOOP PlaybackMode.

          SourceLocationName -> (string)
              The name of the source location where the slate  VOD  source  is
              stored.

          VodSourceName -> (string)
              The  slate VOD source name. The VOD source must already exist in
              a source location before it can be used for slate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SourceLocationName=string,VodSourceName=string

          loops back to the first program in the schedule.

          Possible values:

          o LOOP

          o LINEAR

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
