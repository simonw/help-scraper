LIST-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()                                  LIST-ENDPOINT-GROUPS()



NAME
       list-endpoint-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List the endpoint groups that are associated with a listener.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-endpoint-groups  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: EndpointGroups

          [--ca-bundle <value>]
          [--cli-read-timeout <value>]
          [--cli-connect-timeout <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the listener.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list endpoint groups

       The following list-endpoint-groups example lists  the  endpoint  groups
       for a listener. This listener has two endpoint groups.

          aws globalaccelerator --region us-west-2 list-endpoint-groups \
              --listener-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh/listener/abcdef1234

                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroups -> (list)
          The list of the endpoint groups associated with a listener.

          (structure)
              A complex type for the endpoint group. An  Amazon  Web  Services
              Region can have only one endpoint group for a specific listener.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services Region where the endpoint group is
                 located.

              EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
                 The list of endpoint objects.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for an endpoint. Each endpoint  group  can
                     include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        An  ID  for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network
                        Load Balancer or Application Load  Balancer,  this  is
                        the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the
                        endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic
                        IP  address  allocation  ID. For Amazon EC2 instances,
                        this is the EC2 instance ID.

                        An Application Load Balancer can be either internal or
                        internet-facing.

                     Weight -> (integer)
                        The  weight associated with the endpoint. When you add
                        weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator
                        to  route  traffic based on proportions that you spec-
                        ify. For example, you might specify  endpoint  weights
                        of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of
                        your traffic, on average, is routed to the first  end-
                        point,  5/20  is  routed  both to the second and third
                        endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to  the  last  endpoint.
                        For  more  information,  see  Endpoint  weights in the
                        Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                     HealthState -> (string)
                        The health status of the endpoint.

                     HealthReason -> (string)
                        Returns a null result.

                     ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether client IP  address  preservation  is
                        enabled  for  an endpoint. The value is true or false.
                        The default value is true for  Application  Load  Bal-
                        ancers endpoints.

                        If  the  value is set to true, the client's IP address
                        is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header  as
                        traffic   travels  to  applications  on  the  endpoint
                        fronted by the accelerator.

                        Client IP address preservation is supported,  in  spe-
                        cific  Amazon Web Services Regions, for endpoints that
                        are Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2  instances,
                        and  Network  Load Balancers with security groups. IM-
                        PORTANT: You cannot use client IP address preservation
                        with Network Load Balancers with TLS listeners.

                        For more information, see Preserve client IP addresses
                        in Global Accelerator in the Global Accelerator Devel-
                        oper Guide .

              TrafficDialPercentage -> (float)
                 The  percentage  of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services
                 Region. Additional traffic is distributed to  other  endpoint
                 groups for this listener.

                 Use this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down)
                 traffic to a specific Region. The percentage  is  applied  to
                 the  traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Re-
                 gion based on optimal routing.

                 The default value is 100.

              HealthCheckPort -> (integer)
                 The port that  Global  Accelerator  uses  to  perform  health
                 checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.

                 The  default port is the port for the listener that this end-
                 point group is associated with. If the  listener  port  is  a
                 list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the
                 list of ports.

              HealthCheckProtocol -> (string)
                 The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to  perform  health
                 checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The
                 default value is TCP.

              HealthCheckPath -> (string)
                 If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the  ping
                 path  that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the
                 endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

              HealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
                 The time10 seconds or 30  secondsbetween  health  checks  for
                 each endpoint. The default value is 30.

              ThresholdCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of consecutive health checks required to set the
                 state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to  set  an  un-
                 healthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

              PortOverrides -> (list)
                 Allows  you  to  override the destination ports used to route
                 traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you map  a
                 list  of  external  destination  ports  (that your users send
                 traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that  you
                 want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     Override specific listener ports used to route traffic to
                     endpoints that are part of an endpoint group.  For  exam-
                     ple, you can create a port override in which the listener
                     receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but  your  ac-
                     celerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, re-
                     spectively, on the endpoints.

                     For more information, see Overriding  listener  ports  in
                     the Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                     ListenerPort -> (integer)
                        The  listener  port that you want to map to a specific
                        endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic  ar-
                        rives to the Global Accelerator on.

                     EndpointPort -> (integer)
                        The  endpoint port that you want a listener port to be
                        mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint,  such  as
                        the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
