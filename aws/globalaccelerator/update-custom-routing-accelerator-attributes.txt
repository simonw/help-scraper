NAME
       update-custom-routing-accelerator-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Update the attributes for a custom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-custom-routing-accelerator-attributes
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--flow-logs-enabled | --no-flow-logs-enabled]
          [--flow-logs-s3-bucket <value>]
          [--flow-logs-s3-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom routing accelerator to
          update attributes for.

       --flow-logs-enabled | --no-flow-logs-enabled (boolean)
          Update whether flow logs are enabled. The default value is false. If
          the  value  is  true,  FlowLogsS3Bucket and FlowLogsS3Prefix must be
          specified.

          For more information, see Flow Logs in the  AWS  Global  Accelerator
          Developer Guide .

       --flow-logs-s3-bucket (string)
          The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for the flow logs. Attribute is re-
          quired if FlowLogsEnabled is true . The bucket must exist and have a
          bucket policy that grants AWS Global Accelerator permission to write
          to the bucket.

       --flow-logs-s3-prefix (string)
          Update the prefix for the location in the Amazon S3 bucket  for  the
          flow logs. Attribute is required if FlowLogsEnabled is true .

          If  you  dont specify a prefix, the flow logs are stored in the root
          of the bucket. If you specify slash (/) for the  S3  bucket  prefix,
          the  log  file  bucket  folder structure will include a double slash
          (//), like the following:

          DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET//AWSLogs/aws_account_id

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a custom routing accelerator's attributes

       The following update-custom-routing-accelerator-attributes example  up-
       dates a custom routing accelerator to enable flow logs.

          aws globalaccelerator update-custom-routing-accelerator-attributes \
              --accelerator-arn arn:aws:globalaccelerator::012345678901:accelerator/1234abcd-abcd-1234-abcd-1234abcdefgh \
              --flow-logs-enabled \
              --flow-logs-s3-bucket flowlogs-abc \
              --flow-logs-s3-prefix bucketprefix-abc

       Output:

          {
              "AcceleratorAttributes": {
                  "FlowLogsEnabled": true
                  "FlowLogsS3Bucket": flowlogs-abc
                  "FlowLogsS3Prefix": bucketprefix-abc
              }
          }

       celerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       AcceleratorAttributes -> (structure)
          Updated custom routing accelerator.

          FlowLogsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether flow logs are enabled. The  default  value  is
              false. If the value is true, FlowLogsS3Bucket and FlowLogsS3Pre-
              fix must be specified.

              For more information, see Flow Logs in the AWS Global  Accelera-
              tor Developer Guide .

          FlowLogsS3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the Amazon S3 bucket for the flow logs. Attribute is
              required if FlowLogsEnabled is true . The bucket must exist  and
              have  a bucket policy that grants AWS Global Accelerator permis-
              sion to write to the bucket.

          FlowLogsS3Prefix -> (string)
              The prefix for the location in the Amazon S3 bucket for the flow
              logs. Attribute is required if FlowLogsEnabled is true .

              If  you  dont  specify a prefix, the flow logs are stored in the
              root of the bucket. If you specify slash (/) for the  S3  bucket
              prefix, the log file bucket folder structure will include a dou-
              ble slash (//), like the following:

              DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET//AWSLogs/aws_account_id
