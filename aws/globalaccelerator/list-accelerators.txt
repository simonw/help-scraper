LIST-ACCELERATORS()                                        LIST-ACCELERATORS()



NAME
       list-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       List the accelerators for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-accelerators  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Accelerators

SYNOPSIS
            list-accelerators
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Accelerators -> (list)
          The list of accelerators for a customer account.

          (structure)
              An accelerator is a complex type that includes one or more  lis-
              teners  that process inbound connections and then direct traffic
              to one or more endpoint groups,  each  of  which  includes  end-
              points, such as load balancers.

              AcceleratorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of the accelerator. The name must contain only al-
                 phanumeric characters or hyphens (-), and must not  begin  or
                 end with a hyphen.

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The value for the address type must be IPv4.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the  accelerator is enabled. The value is
                 true or false. The default value is true.

                 If the value is  set  to  true,  the  accelerator  cannot  be
                 deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

              IpSets -> (list)
                 The  static  IP  addresses that Global Accelerator associates
                 with the accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type for the set of IP addresses for an  accel-
                     erator.

                     IpFamily -> (string)
                        The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

                     IpAddresses -> (list)
                        The array of IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                        address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                        (string)

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The Domain Name System (DNS)  name  that  Global  Accelerator
                 creates  that  points  to  your  accelerator's  static IP ad-
                 dresses.

                 The naming convention for the DNS name is  the  following:  A
                 lowercase  letter  a, followed by a 16-bit random hex string,
                 followed   by   .awsglobalaccelerator.com.    For    example:
                 a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

                 For  more information about the default DNS name, see Support
                 for DNS Addressing in Global Accelerator in  the  AWS  Global
                 Accelerator Developer Guide .

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
