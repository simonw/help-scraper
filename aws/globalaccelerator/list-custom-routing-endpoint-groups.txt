NAME
       list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       List the endpoint groups that are associated with a listener for a cus-
       tom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-endpoint-groups
          --listener-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --listener-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  listener  to  list  endpoint
          groups for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  number  of  endpoint group objects that you want to return with
          this call. The default value is 10.

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroups -> (list)
          The  list  of  the  endpoint groups associated with a listener for a
          custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              A complex type for the endpoint group for a custom  routing  ac-
              celerator.  An AWS Region can have only one endpoint group for a
              specific listener.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region where the endpoint group is located.

              DestinationDescriptions -> (list)
                 For a custom routing accelerator, describes  the  port  range
                 and  protocol  for  all endpoints (virtual private cloud sub-
                 nets) in an endpoint group to accept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     For a custom  routing  accelerator,  describes  the  port
                     range  and  protocol  for  all endpoints (virtual private
                     cloud subnets) in an  endpoint  group  to  accept  client
                     traffic on.

                     FromPort -> (integer)
                        The  first  port, inclusive, in the range of ports for
                        the endpoint group that is associated  with  a  custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     ToPort -> (integer)
                        The  last  port,  inclusive, in the range of ports for
                        the endpoint group that is associated  with  a  custom
                        routing accelerator.

                     Protocols -> (list)
                        The protocol for the endpoint group that is associated
                        with a custom routing accelerator. The protocol can be
                        either TCP or UDP.

                        (string)

              EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
                 For  a  custom  routing  accelerator, describes the endpoints
                 (virtual private cloud subnets) in an endpoint group  to  ac-
                 cept client traffic on.

                 (structure)
                     A  complex  type for an endpoint for a custom routing ac-
                     celerator. Each endpoint group can include  one  or  more
                     endpoints, which are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.

                     EndpointId -> (string)
                        An  ID  for the endpoint. For custom routing accelera-
                        tors, this is the virtual private cloud  (VPC)  subnet
                        ID.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
