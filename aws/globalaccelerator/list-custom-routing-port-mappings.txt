NAME
       list-custom-routing-port-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  a complete mapping from the public accelerator IP address and
       port to destination EC2 instance IP addresses and ports in the  virtual
       public  cloud  (VPC)  subnet endpoint for a custom routing accelerator.
       For each subnet endpoint that you add, Global Accelerator creates a new
       static port mapping for the accelerator. The port mappings don't change
       after Global Accelerator generates them, so you can retrieve and  cache
       the full mapping on your servers.

       If  you  remove  a subnet from your accelerator, Global Accelerator re-
       moves (reclaims) the port mappings. If you add a subnet to your  accel-
       erator, Global Accelerator creates new port mappings (the existing ones
       don't change). If you add or remove EC2 instances in your  subnet,  the
       port  mappings  don't change, because the mappings are created when you
       add the subnet to Global Accelerator.

       The mappings also include a flag for each  destination  denoting  which
       destination IP addresses and ports are allowed or denied traffic.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-routing-port-mappings  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: PortMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-port-mappings
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--endpoint-group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator to list the custom
          routing port mappings for.

       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the endpoint group to list the
          custom routing port mappings for.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The following list-custom-routing-port-mappings example provides a par-
       tial list of the port mappings in a custom routing accelerator.

OUTPUT
       PortMappings -> (list)
          The port mappings for a custom routing accelerator.

          (structure)
              Returns the ports and associated IP addresses and ports of  Ama-
              zon  EC2  instances in your virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.
              Custom routing is a port mapping protocol in AWS Global Acceler-
              ator  that  statically  associates port ranges with VPC subnets,
              which allows Global Accelerator to route to  specific  instances
              and ports within one or more subnets.

              AcceleratorPort -> (integer)
                 The accelerator port.

              EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

              EndpointId -> (string)
                 The IP address of the VPC subnet (the subnet ID).

              DestinationSocketAddress -> (structure)
                 The  EC2  instance  IP address and port number in the virtual
                 private cloud (VPC) subnet.

                 IpAddress -> (string)
                     The IP address for the socket address.

                 Port -> (integer)
                     The port for the socket address.

              Protocols -> (list)
                 The protocols supported by the endpoint group.

                 (string)

              DestinationTrafficState -> (string)
                 Indicates whether or not a port mapping destination  can  re-
                 ceive  traffic.  The value is either ALLOW, if traffic is al-
                 lowed to the destination, or DENY, if traffic is not  allowed
                 to the destination.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
