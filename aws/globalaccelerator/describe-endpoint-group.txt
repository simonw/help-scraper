DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-GROUP()                            DESCRIBE-ENDPOINT-GROUP()



NAME
       describe-endpoint-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Describe an endpoint group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-endpoint-group
          --endpoint-group-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-group-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe an endpoint group

       The  following  describe-endpoint-group example retrieves details about
       an endpoint group with the following endpoints: an Amazon EC2 instance,
       an ALB, and an NLB.

OUTPUT
       EndpointGroup -> (structure)
          The description of an endpoint group.

          EndpointGroupArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the endpoint group.

          EndpointGroupRegion -> (string)
              The Amazon Web Services Region where the endpoint group  is  lo-
              cated.

          EndpointDescriptions -> (list)
              The list of endpoint objects.

              (structure)
                 A  complex  type for an endpoint. Each endpoint group can in-
                 clude one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.

                 EndpointId -> (string)
                     An ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load
                     Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon
                     Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the  endpoint  is
                     an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address al-
                     location ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this  is  the  EC2
                     instance ID.

                     An  Application  Load  Balancer can be either internal or
                     internet-facing.

                 Weight -> (integer)
                     The weight associated with the  endpoint.  When  you  add
                     weights to endpoints, you configure Global Accelerator to
                     route traffic based on proportions that you specify.  For
                     example,  you  might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5,
                     and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your  traffic,
                     on  average,  is  routed  to  the first endpoint, 5/20 is
                     routed both to the second and third endpoints,  and  6/20
                     is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see
                     Endpoint weights  in  the  Global  Accelerator  Developer
                     Guide .

                 HealthState -> (string)
                     The health status of the endpoint.

                 HealthReason -> (string)
                     Returns a null result.

                 ClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  client IP address preservation is en-
                     abled for an endpoint. The value is true  or  false.  The
                     default value is true for new accelerators.

                     If  the  value is set to true, the client's IP address is
                     preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as  traf-
                     fic  travels  to  applications on the endpoint fronted by
                     the accelerator.

                     Client IP address preservation is supported, in  specific
                     Amazon  Web  Services Regions, for endpoints that are Ap-
                     plication Load Balancers and Amazon EC2 instances.

                     For more information, see Preserve client IP addresses in
                     Global  Accelerator  in  the Global Accelerator Developer
                     Guide .

          TrafficDialPercentage -> (float)
              The percentage of traffic to send to an Amazon Web Services  Re-
              gion. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups
              for this listener.

              Use this action to increase (dial up) or  decrease  (dial  down)
              traffic  to  a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the
              traffic that would otherwise have  been  routed  to  the  Region
              based on optimal routing.

              The default value is 100.

          HealthCheckPort -> (integer)
              The  port  that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks
              on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.

              The default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint
              group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global
              Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.

          HealthCheckProtocol -> (string)
              The protocol that Global  Accelerator  uses  to  perform  health
              checks  on  endpoints  that are part of this endpoint group. The
              default value is TCP.

          HealthCheckPath -> (string)
              If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this  value  provides  the  ping
              path  that  Global  Accelerator  uses for the destination on the
              endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).

          HealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)
              The time10 seconds or 30 secondsbetween health checks  for  each
              endpoint. The default value is 30.

          ThresholdCount -> (integer)
              The  number  of  consecutive  health  checks required to set the
              state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy
              endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.

          PortOverrides -> (list)
              Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traf-
              fic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you map a list of
              external  destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to
              a list of internal destination ports that you want  an  applica-
              tion endpoint to receive traffic on.

              (structure)
                 Override  specific  listener  ports  used to route traffic to
                 endpoints that are part of an endpoint  group.  For  example,
                 you can create a port override in which the listener receives
                 user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes
                 that  traffic  to  ports  1080 and 1443, respectively, on the
                 endpoints.

                 For more information, see Overriding listener  ports  in  the
                 Global Accelerator Developer Guide .

                 ListenerPort -> (integer)
                     The listener port that you want to map to a specific end-
                     point port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to
                     the Global Accelerator on.

                 EndpointPort -> (integer)
                     The  endpoint  port  that  you want a listener port to be
                     mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as  the
                     Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.
