NAME
       describe-custom-routing-accelerator -

DESCRIPTION
       Describe a custom routing accelerator.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-routing-accelerator
          --accelerator-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accelerator-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the accelerator to describe.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a custom routing accelerator

       The following describe-custom-routing-accelerator example retrieves the
       details about the specified custom routing accelerator.

OUTPUT
       Accelerator -> (structure)
          The description of the custom routing accelerator.

          AcceleratorArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom  routing  accelera-
              tor.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the accelerator. The name must contain only alphanu-
              meric characters or hyphens (-), and must not begin or end  with
              a hyphen.

          IpAddressType -> (string)
              The value for the address type must be IPv4.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether the accelerator is enabled. The value is true
              or false. The default value is true.

              If the value is set to true, the accelerator cannot be  deleted.
              If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

          IpSets -> (list)
              The  static IP addresses that Global Accelerator associates with
              the accelerator.

              (structure)
                 A complex type for the set of IP addresses for  an  accelera-
                 tor.

                 IpFamily -> (string)
                     The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

                 IpAddresses -> (list)
                     The  array  of  IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                     address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                     (string)

          DnsName -> (string)
              The Domain Name System (DNS) name that Global  Accelerator  cre-
              ates that points to your accelerator's static IP addresses.

              The  naming convention for the DNS name is the following: A low-
              ercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random  hex  string,  fol-
              lowed     by     .awsglobalaccelerator.com.     For     example:
              a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

              For more information about the default DNS name, see Support for
              DNS Addressing in Global Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelera-
              tor Developer Guide .

          Status -> (string)
              Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

          CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was created.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.
