NAME
       list-custom-routing-accelerators -

DESCRIPTION
       List the custom routing accelerators for an AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-routing-accelerators is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Accelerators

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-accelerators
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Accelerators -> (list)
          The list of custom routing accelerators for a customer account.

              Attributes of a custom routing accelerator.

              AcceleratorArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the custom routing acceler-
                 ator.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the accelerator. The name must contain  only  al-
                 phanumeric  characters  or hyphens (-), and must not begin or
                 end with a hyphen.

              IpAddressType -> (string)
                 The value for the address type must be IPv4.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled.  The  value  is
                 true or false. The default value is true.

                 If  the  value  is  set  to  true,  the accelerator cannot be
                 deleted. If set to false, accelerator can be deleted.

              IpSets -> (list)
                 The static IP addresses that  Global  Accelerator  associates
                 with the accelerator.

                 (structure)
                     A  complex type for the set of IP addresses for an accel-
                     erator.

                     IpFamily -> (string)
                        The types of IP addresses included in this IP set.

                     IpAddresses -> (list)
                        The array of IP addresses in the IP address set. An IP
                        address set can have a maximum of two IP addresses.

                        (string)

              DnsName -> (string)
                 The  Domain  Name  System  (DNS) name that Global Accelerator
                 creates that points  to  your  accelerator's  static  IP  ad-
                 dresses.

                 The  naming  convention  for the DNS name is the following: A
                 lowercase letter a, followed by a 16-bit random  hex  string,
                 followed    by    .awsglobalaccelerator.com.   For   example:
                 a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com.

                 For more information about the default DNS name, see  Support
                 for  DNS  Addressing  in Global Accelerator in the AWS Global
                 Accelerator Developer Guide .

              Status -> (string)
                 Describes the deployment status of the accelerator.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the accelerator was last modified.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results. You receive this token from a
          previous call.
