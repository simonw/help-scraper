LIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-PORT-MAPLIST-CUSTOM-ROUTING-PORT-MAPPINGS-BY-DESTINATION()



NAME
       list-custom-routing-port-mappings-by-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  port mappings for a specific EC2 instance (destination) in a
       VPC subnet endpoint. The response is the mappings for  one  destination
       IP  address. This is useful when your subnet endpoint has mappings that
       span multiple custom routing accelerators in your account, or for  sce-
       narios  where  you  only  want to list the port mappings for a specific
       destination instance.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-custom-routing-port-mappings-by-destination is a paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results  of  the  following  query expressions: Destination-
       PortMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-custom-routing-port-mappings-by-destination
          --endpoint-id <value>
          --destination-address <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --endpoint-id (string)
          The ID for the virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet.

       --destination-address (string)
          The endpoint IP address in a virtual private cloud (VPC) subnet  for
          which you want to receive back port mappings.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the port mappings for a  specific  custom  routing  accelerator
       destination

       The  following list-custom-routing-port-mappings-by-destination example
       provides the port mappings for a specific destination  EC2  server  (at
       the destination address) for a custom routing accelerator.

          aws globalaccelerator list-custom-routing-port-mappings-by-destination \
              --endpoint-id subnet-abcd123example \
              --destination-address 198.51.100.52
