GET-SIGNING-PROFILE()                                    GET-SIGNING-PROFILE()



NAME
       get-signing-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information on a specific signing profile.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-signing-profile
          --profile-name <value>
          [--profile-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --profile-name (string)
          The name of the target signing profile.

       --profile-owner (string)
          The AWS account ID of the profile owner.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To display details about a signing profile

       The  following  get-signing-profile  example displays details about the
       specified signing profile.

          aws signer get-signing-profile \
              --profile-name MyProfile3

       Output:

          {

              "status": "Active",
              "signingMaterial": {
                  "certificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate/6a55389b-306b-4e8c-a95c-0123456789abc"
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       profileName -> (string)
          The name of the target signing profile.

       profileVersion -> (string)
          The current version of the signing profile.

       profileVersionArn -> (string)
          The signing profile ARN, including the profile version.

       revocationRecord -> (structure)
          Revocation information for a signing profile.

          revocationEffectiveFrom -> (timestamp)
              The time when revocation becomes effective.

          revokedAt -> (timestamp)
              The time when the signing profile was revoked.

          revokedBy -> (string)
              The identity of the revoker.

       signingMaterial -> (structure)
          The ARN of the certificate that the target profile uses for  signing
          operations.

          certificateArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificates that is used
              to sign your code.

       platformId -> (string)
          The ID of the platform that is used by the target signing profile.

       platformDisplayName -> (string)
          A human-readable name for the signing platform associated  with  the
          signing profile.

       signatureValidityPeriod -> (structure)
          The validity period for a signing job.

          value -> (integer)
              The numerical value of the time unit for signature validity.

          type -> (string)
              The time unit for signature validity.

       overrides -> (structure)
          A  list of overrides applied by the target signing profile for sign-
          ing operations.

          signingConfiguration -> (structure)
              A signing configuration that overrides the default encryption or
              hash algorithm of a signing job.

              encryptionAlgorithm -> (string)
                 A specified override of the default encryption algorithm that
                 is used in a code signing job.

              hashAlgorithm -> (string)
                 A specified override of the default hash  algorithm  that  is
                 used in a code signing job.

          signingImageFormat -> (string)
              A  signed  image  is  a JSON object. When overriding the default
              signing platform configuration, a customer can select either  of
              two  signing  formats,  JSONEmbedded  or JSONDetached . (A third
              format value, JSON , is reserved for future use.)  With  JSONEm-
              bedded  , the signing image has the payload embedded in it. With
              JSONDetached , the payload is not be embedded in the signing im-
              age.

       signingParameters -> (map)
