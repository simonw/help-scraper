NAME
       cognito-identity -

DESCRIPTION
       Amazon  Cognito  Federated  Identities  is  a web service that delivers
       scoped temporary credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted  en-
       vironments.  It uniquely identifies a device and supplies the user with
       a consistent identity over the lifetime of an application.

       Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can  enable  authentica-
       tion with one or more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google,
       or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon Cognito user pool, and you can  also
       choose  to support unauthenticated access from your app. Cognito deliv-
       ers a unique identifier for each user  and  acts  as  an  OpenID  token
       provider  trusted  by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access tempo-
       rary, limited-privilege AWS credentials.

       For a description of the authentication flow from  the  Amazon  Cognito
       Developer Guide see Authentication Flow .
