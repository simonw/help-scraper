DESCRIPTION
       Welcome to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller API Ref-
       erence Guide for Recovery Control Data Plane .

       Recovery control in Route 53 Application Recovery  Controller  includes
       extremely reliable routing controls that enable you to recover applica-
       tions by rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability  Zones  or
       AWS  Regions.  Routing  controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a
       cluster. A cluster is  a  set  of  five  redundant  regional  endpoints
       against  which  you can execute API calls to update or get the state of
       routing controls. You use routing controls to failover traffic  to  re-
       cover your application across Availability Zones or Regions.

       This API guide includes information about how to get and update routing
       control states in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
