DESCRIPTION
       This  reference  provides descriptions of the low-level AWS Marketplace
       Metering Service API.

       AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for  cus-
       tom usage dimensions.

       For  information  on  the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS
       Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions in the  AWS  Market-
       place Seller Guide.
          Submitting Metering Records

       o MeterUsage  -  Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product.
         MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container  running  on
         EKS or ECS.

       o BatchMeterUsage - Submits the metering record for a set of customers.
         BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS)  appli-
         cation.
          Accepting New Customers

       o ResolveCustomer  -  Called by a SaaS application during the registra-
         tion process. When a buyer visits your website during  the  registra-
         tion  process,  the  buyer  submits  a Registration Token through the
         browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API  to  ob-
         tain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code.
          Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products

       o Paid  container  software  products sold through AWS Marketplace must
         integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the Reg-
         isterUsage  operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and
         BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't  required  to  call
         RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in
         your seller reports. For more information on using the  RegisterUsage
         operation, see Container-Based Products .

       BatchMeterUsage  API  calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use
       Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you  sent  are
       accurate  by  searching  for  records  with  the  eventName of BatchMe-
       terUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over  time.  For
       more information, see the * AWS CloudTrail User Guide * .
