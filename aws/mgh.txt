DESCRIPTION
       The AWS Migration Hub API methods help to obtain server and application
       migration status and integrate your resource-specific migration tool by
       providing a programmatic interface to Migration Hub.

       Remember  that  you  must set your AWS Migration Hub home region before
       you call any of these APIs, or a HomeRegionNotSetException  error  will
       be  returned.  Also, you must make the API calls while in your home re-
       gion.
