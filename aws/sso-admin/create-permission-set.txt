OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the  PermissionSet .

       --description (string)
          The description of the  PermissionSet .

       --instance-arn (string)
          The ARN of the SSO instance under which the operation will  be  exe-
          cuted.  For  more  information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names
          (ARNs) and Amazon Web Services Service Namespaces in the Amazon  Web
          Services General Reference .

       --session-duration (string)
          The  length  of time that the application user sessions are valid in
          the ISO-8601 standard.

       --relay-state (string)
          Used to redirect users within the application during the  federation
          authentication process.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to attach to the new  PermissionSet .

          (structure)
              A  set  of key-value pairs that are used to manage the resource.
              Tags can only be applied to permission sets and  cannot  be  ap-
              plied  to  corresponding roles that Amazon Web Services SSO cre-
              ates in Amazon Web Services accounts.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
