SYNOPSIS
            delete-mailbox-permissions
          --organization-id <value>
          --entity-id <value>
          --grantee-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The  identifier  of the organization under which the member (user or
          group) exists.

       --entity-id (string)
          The identifier of the member (user or group) that owns the mailbox.

       --grantee-id (string)
          The identifier of the member (user or group)  for  which  to  delete
          granted permissions.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
