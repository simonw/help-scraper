DEREGISTER-MAIL-DOMAIN()                              DEREGISTER-MAIL-DOMAIN()



NAME
       deregister-mail-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes a domain from Amazon WorkMail, stops email routing to WorkMail,
       and removes the authorization allowing WorkMail use. SES keeps the  do-
       main  because  other applications may use it. You must first remove any
       email address used by WorkMail entities before you remove the domain.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-mail-domain
          --organization-id <value>
          --domain-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The Amazon WorkMail organization for which the domain will be dereg-
          istered.

       --domain-name (string)
          The domain to deregister in WorkMail and SES.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
