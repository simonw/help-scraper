SYNOPSIS
            delete-mobile-device-access-override
          --organization-id <value>
          --user-id <value>
          --device-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The Amazon WorkMail organization for which the access override  will
          be deleted.

       --user-id (string)
          The WorkMail user for which you want to delete the override. Accepts
          the following types of user identities:

          o User       ID:       12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012       or
            S-1-1-12-1234567890-123456789-123456789-1234

          o Email address: user@domain.tld

          o User name: user

       --device-id (string)
          The  mobile  device  for  which you delete the override. DeviceId is
          case insensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
