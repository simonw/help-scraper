NAME
       get-mobile-device-access-effect -

DESCRIPTION
       Simulates  the  effect  of the mobile device access rules for the given
       attributes of a sample access event. Use this method to  test  the  ef-
       fects  of  the current set of mobile device access rules for the Amazon
       WorkMail organization for a particular user's attributes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-mobile-device-access-effect
          --organization-id <value>
          [--device-type <value>]
          [--device-model <value>]
          [--device-operating-system <value>]
          [--device-user-agent <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-id (string)
          The Amazon WorkMail organization to simulate the access effect for.

       --device-type (string)
          Device type the simulated user will report.

       --device-model (string)
          Device model the simulated user will report.

       --device-operating-system (string)
          Device operating system the simulated user will report.

       --device-user-agent (string)
          Device user agent the simulated user will report.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Effect -> (string)
          The effect of the simulated access, ALLOW or DENY , after evaluating
          mobile  device  access rules in the Amazon WorkMail organization for
          the simulated user parameters.

       MatchedRules -> (list)
          A list of the rules which matched the simulated user input and  pro-
          duced the effect.

          (structure)
              The rule that a simulated user matches.

              MobileDeviceAccessRuleId -> (string)
                 Identifier of the rule that a simulated user matches.

              Name -> (string)
                 Name of a rule that a simulated user matches.
