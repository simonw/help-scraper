NAME
       list-app-version-resource-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  how  the  resources in an application version are mapped/sourced
       from. Mappings can be  physical  resource  identifiers,  CloudFormation
       stacks, resource-groups, or an application registry app.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-app-version-resource-mappings
          --app-arn <value>
          --app-version <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --app-version (string)
          The version of the application.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the token from a previous call to get the next set of re-
          sults.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token for the next set of results, or null if there are no more
          results.

       resourceMappings -> (list)
          Mappings used to map logical resources from the template to physical
          resources. You can use the mapping type CFN_STACK if the application
          template uses a logical stack name. Or you can  map  individual  re-
          sources  by using the mapping type RESOURCE . We recommend using the
          mapping type CFN_STACK if the application is backed by a CloudForma-
          tion stack.

          (structure)
              Defines a resource mapping.

              appRegistryAppName -> (string)
                 The name of the application this resource is mapped to.

              logicalStackName -> (string)
                 The  name of the CloudFormation stack this resource is mapped
                 to.

              mappingType -> (string)
                 Specifies the type of resource mapping.
                     AppRegistryApp

                 The resource is mapped to another application.  The  name  of
                 the  application is contained in the appRegistryAppName prop-
                 erty.
                     CfnStack

                 The resource is mapped to a CloudFormation stack. The name of
                 the CloudFormation stack is contained in the logicalStackName
                 property.
                     Resource

                 The resource is mapped to another resource. The name  of  the
                 resource is contained in the resourceName property.
                     ResourceGroup

                 The  resource  is mapped to a resource group. The name of the
                 resource group is contained in  the  resourceGroupName  prop-
                 erty.

              physicalResourceId -> (structure)
                 The identifier of this resource.

                 awsAccountId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Web  Services account that owns the physical
                     resource.

                 awsRegion -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region that the physical resource
                     is located in.

                 identifier -> (string)
                     The identifier of the physical resource.

                 type -> (string)
                     Specifies the type of physical resource identifier.
                        Arn

                     The  resource identifier is an Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
                     .
                        Native

                     The resource identifier is a Resilience Hub-native  iden-
                     tifier.

              resourceGroupName -> (string)
                 The name of the resource group this resource is mapped to.
