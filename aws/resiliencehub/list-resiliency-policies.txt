NAME
       list-resiliency-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the resiliency policies for the Resilience Hub applications.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-resiliency-policies
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--policy-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. If more
          results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null, or the token from a previous call to get the next set  of  re-
          sults.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of results, or null if there are no  more
          results.

       resiliencyPolicies -> (list)
          The resiliency policies for the Resilience Hub applications.

          (structure)
              Defines a resiliency policy.

              creationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp for when the resiliency policy was created.

              dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
                 Specifies  a  high-level geographical location constraint for
                 where your resilience policy data can be stored.

              estimatedCostTier -> (string)
                 Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

              policy -> (map)
                 The resiliency policy.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Defines a failure policy.

                     rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                        The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

                     rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                        The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

              policyArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy.  The
                 format  for  this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region
                 :account :resiliency-policy/policy-id . For more  information
                 about  ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS Gen-
                 eral Reference .

              policyDescription -> (string)
                 The description for the policy.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of the policy

              tags -> (map)
                 The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that  you
                 assign  to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists
                 of a key/value pair.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tier -> (string)
                 The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest
                 severity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).
