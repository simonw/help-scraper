       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-test-recommendations
          --assessment-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the assessment. The format for
          this  ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account   :app-assess-
          ment/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to include in the  response.  If  more
          results  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null,  or  the token from a previous call to get the next set of re-
          sults.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
