NAME
       describe-app-assessment -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes an assessment for an AWS Resilience Hub application.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-app-assessment
          --assessment-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the assessment. The format for
          this  ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account   :app-assess-
          ment/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
