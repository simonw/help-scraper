OPTIONS
       --assessment-arn (string)
          Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the assessment. The format for this
          ARN is: arn:partition  :resiliencehub:region  :account  :app-assess-
          ment/app-id  .  For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference guide.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                 a key/value pair.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              tier -> (string)

                 The  score generated by Resilience Hub for the scoring compo-
                 nent after running an assessment.

                 For example, if the score is  25  points,  it  indicates  the
                 overall score of your application generated by Resilience Hub
                 after running an assessment.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     Resiliency score of each scoring component. For more  in-
                     formation  about  scoring  component, see Calculating re-
                     siliency score .

                     excludedCount -> (long)
                        Number of recommendations that were excluded from  the
                        assessment.

                        For  example, if the excludedCount for Alarms coverage
                        scoring component is 7, it  indicates  that  7  Amazon
                        CloudWatch alarms are excluded from the assessment.

                     outstandingCount -> (long)
                        Number  of recommendations that must be implemented to
                        obtain the maximum possible score for the scoring com-
                        ponent.  For  SOPs,  alarms,  and tests, these are the
                        number of recommendations that  must  be  implemented.
                        For  compliance,  these  are the number of Application
                        Components that have breached the resiliency policy.

                        For example, if the outstandingCount for Alarms cover-
                        age scoring component is 5, it indicates that 5 Amazon
                        CloudWatch alarms need to be  implemented  to  achieve
                        the maximum possible score.

                     possibleScore -> (double)
                        Maximum  possible  score  that can be obtained for the
                        scoring component.

                        For example, if the possibleScore is 20 points, it in-
                        dicates the maximum possible score you can achieve for
                        the scoring component when you run  a  new  assessment
                        after  implementing all the Resilience Hub recommenda-
                        tions.

                     score -> (double)
                        Resiliency score points given for the  scoring  compo-
                        nent.  The  score  is always less than or equal to the
                        possibleScore .

              disruptionScore -> (map)
                 The disruption score for a valid key.

                 key -> (string)
