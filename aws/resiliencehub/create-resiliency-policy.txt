            create-resiliency-policy
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--data-location-constraint <value>]

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          Used for an idempotency token. A client token is a unique, case-sen-
          sitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. You should not reuse the
          same client token for other API requests.

       --data-location-constraint (string)
          Specifies  a  high-level  geographical location constraint for where
          your resilience policy data can be stored.

          Possible values:

          o AnyLocation

          o SameContinent

          o SameCountry

       --policy (map)
          The type of resiliency policy to be created, including the  recovery
          time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) in seconds.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Defines a failure policy.

              rpoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Point Objective (RPO), in seconds.

              rtoInSecs -> (integer)
                 The Recovery Time Objective (RTO), in seconds.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer,KeyName2=rpoInSecs=integer,rtoInSecs=integer

          Where valid key names are:
            Software
            Hardware
            AZ
            Region

       JSON Syntax:

          {"Software"|"Hardware"|"AZ"|"Region": {
                "rpoInSecs": integer,
                "rtoInSecs": integer
              }
            ...}

       --policy-description (string)
          The description for the policy.

       --policy-name (string)
          The name of the policy

       --tags (map)
          The  tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value
          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tier (string)
          The tier for this resiliency policy, ranging from the highest sever-
          ity (MissionCritical ) to lowest (NonCritical ).

          Possible values:

          o MissionCritical

          o Critical

          o Important

          o CoreServices

          o NonCritical

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       policy -> (structure)
          The type of resiliency policy that was created, including the recov-

          onds.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the resiliency policy was created.

          dataLocationConstraint -> (string)
              Specifies  a  high-level  geographical  location  constraint for
              where your resilience policy data can be stored.

              Specifies the estimated cost tier of the resiliency policy.

          policy -> (map)
              The resiliency policy.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (structure)

              The name of the policy

          tags -> (map)
              The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you as-
              sign to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of  a
