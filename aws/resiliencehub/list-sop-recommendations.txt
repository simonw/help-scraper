SYNOPSIS
            list-sop-recommendations
          --assessment-arn <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  assessment.  The  format  for
          this   ARN  is:  arn:partition  :dcps:region  :account  :app-assess-
          ment/app-id . For more information about ARNs, see  Amazon  Resource
          Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results to include in the response. If more
          results exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          Null, or the token from a previous call to get the next set  of  re-
          sults.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
