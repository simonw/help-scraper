CREATE-APP()                                                      CREATE-APP()



NAME
       create-app -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a Resilience Hub application. A Resilience Hub application is a
       collection of Amazon Web Services resources structured to  prevent  and
       recover  Amazon Web Services application disruptions. To describe a Re-
       silience Hub application, you provide an  application  name,  resources
       from one or moreup to fiveCloudFormation stacks, and an appropriate re-
       siliency policy.
          <p>After you create a Resilience Hub application, you publish it  so
          that  you  can  run  a resiliency assessment on it. You can then use
          recommendations from the assessment to improve resiliency by running
          another  assessment,  comparing  results,  and  then  iterating  the
          process until you achieve your goals  for  recovery  time  objective
          (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO).</p>

SYNOPSIS
            create-app
          [--assessment-schedule <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          --name <value>
          [--policy-arn <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --assessment-schedule (string)
          Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.

          Possible values:

          o Disabled

          o Daily

       --client-token (string)
          Used for an idempotency token. A client token is a unique, case-sen-
          sitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. You should not reuse the
          same client token for other API requests.

       --description (string)
          The optional description for an app.

       --name (string)
          The name for the application.

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for this ARN is: arn:partition :resiliencehub:region  :account  :re-
          siliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --tags (map)
          The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you  assign
          to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a key/value
          pair.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       app -> (structure)
          The created application returned as an object with details including
          compliance status, creation time, description, resiliency score, and
          more.

          appArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format
              for this ARN is:  arn:partition  :resiliencehub:region  :account
              :app/app-id  .  For  more information about ARNs, see Amazon Re-
              source Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          assessmentSchedule -> (string)
              Assessment execution schedule with 'Daily' or 'Disabled' values.

          complianceStatus -> (string)
              The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the app was created.

          description -> (string)
              The optional description for an app.

          lastAppComplianceEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent compliance evaluation.

          lastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent resiliency score evaluation.

          name -> (string)
              The name for the application.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resiliency  policy.  The

              count :resiliency-policy/policy-id . For more information  about
              ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Refer-
              ence .

          resiliencyScore -> (double)

          status -> (string)
              The status of the action.
