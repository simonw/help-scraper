DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-app
          --app-arn <value>
          [--clear-resiliency-policy-arn | --no-clear-resiliency-policy-arn]
          [--description <value>]
          [--policy-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --app-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the application. The format for
          this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id  .  For
          more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the
          AWS General Reference .

       --clear-resiliency-policy-arn | --no-clear-resiliency-policy-arn (bool-
       ean)
          Specifies if the resiliency policy ARN should be cleared.

       --description (string)
          The optional description for an app.

       --policy-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The format
          for  this  ARN  is:   arn:partition   :dcps:region   :account   :re-
          siliency-policy/policy-id  .  For  more  information about ARNs, see
          Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       app -> (structure)
          The specified application, returned as an object  with  details  in-
          cluding  compliance  status,  creation time, description, resiliency
          score, and more.

          appArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  application.  The  format
              for this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :app/app-id
              . For more information about ARNs,  see  Amazon  Resource  Names
              (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          complianceStatus -> (string)
              The current status of compliance for the resiliency policy.

          creationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for when the app was created.

          description -> (string)
              The optional description for an app.

          lastAppComplianceEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent compliance evaluation.

          lastResiliencyScoreEvaluationTime -> (timestamp)
              The timestamp for the most recent resiliency score evaluation.

          name -> (string)
              The name for the application.

          policyArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the resiliency policy. The
              format for this ARN is: arn:partition :dcps:region :account :re-
              siliency-policy/policy-id . For more information about ARNs, see
              Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the AWS General Reference .

          resiliencyScore -> (double)
              The current resiliency score for the application.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the action.

          tags -> (map)
              The tags assigned to the resource. A tag is a label that you as-
              sign  to an Amazon Web Services resource. Each tag consists of a
              key/value pair.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)
