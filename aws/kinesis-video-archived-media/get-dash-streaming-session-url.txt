NAME
       get-dash-streaming-session-url -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  an  MPEG Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) URL for
       the stream. You can then open the URL in a media  player  to  view  the
       stream contents.

       Both  the StreamName and the StreamARN parameters are optional, but you
       must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN when invoking  this
       API operation.

       An  Amazon Kinesis video stream has the following requirements for pro-
       viding data through MPEG-DASH:

       o The media must contain h.264 or h.265 encoded video and,  optionally,
         AAC  or  G.711  encoded  audio. Specifically, the codec ID of track 1
         should be V_MPEG/ISO/AVC (for h.264) or V_MPEGH/ISO/HEVC (for H.265).
         Optionally,  the  codec  ID  of  track 2 should be A_AAC (for AAC) or
         A_MS/ACM (for G.711).

       o Data retention must be greater than 0.

       o The video track of each fragment must contain codec private  data  in
         the  Advanced  Video Coding (AVC) for H.264 format and HEVC for H.265
         format.  For  more  information,  see  MPEG-4  specification  ISO/IEC
         14496-15 . For information about adapting stream data to a given for-
         mat, see NAL Adaptation Flags .

       o The audio track (if present) of each fragment must contain codec pri-
         vate  data  in the AAC format (AAC specification ISO/IEC 13818-7 ) or
         the MS Wave format .

       The following procedure shows how to use MPEG-DASH with  Kinesis  Video
       Streams:

       o Get  an  endpoint using GetDataEndpoint , specifying GET_DASH_STREAM-
         ING_SESSION_URL for the APIName parameter.

       o Retrieve the MPEG-DASH URL using GetDASHStreamingSessionURL . Kinesis
         Video  Streams  creates an MPEG-DASH streaming session to be used for
         accessing content in a stream using the MPEG-DASH protocol.  GetDASH-
         StreamingSessionURL  returns  an  authenticated URL (that includes an
         encrypted session token) for the session's  MPEG-DASH  manifest  (the
         root resource needed for streaming with MPEG-DASH).

       NOTE:
              Don't share or store this token where an unauthorized entity can
              access it. The token provides  access  to  the  content  of  the
              stream.  Safeguard the token with the same measures that you use
              with your AWS credentials.

          The media that is made available through the manifest consists  only
          of the requested stream, time range, and format. No other media data
          (such as frames outside the requested window or alternate  bitrates)
          is made available.

       o Provide  the  URL  (containing  the  encrypted session token) for the
         MPEG-DASH manifest to a media player that supports the MPEG-DASH pro-
         tocol.  Kinesis  Video  Streams makes the initialization fragment and
         media fragments available through the manifest URL.  The  initializa-
         tion  fragment  contains  the  codec private data for the stream, and
         other data needed to set up the video or audio decoder and  renderer.
         The  media  fragments  contain  encoded video frames or encoded audio
         samples.

       o The media player receives the authenticated URL and  requests  stream
         metadata  and  media  data  normally.  When the media player requests
         data, it calls the following actions:

         o GetDASHManifest: Retrieves an MPEG DASH  manifest,  which  contains
           the metadata for the media that you want to playback.

         o GetMP4InitFragment:  Retrieves the MP4 initialization fragment. The
           media player typically loads  the  initialization  fragment  before
           loading any media fragments. This fragment contains the "fytp " and
           "moov " MP4 atoms, and the child atoms that are needed to  initial-
           ize  the media player decoder. The initialization fragment does not
           correspond to a fragment in a Kinesis  video  stream.  It  contains
           only  the  codec  private data for the stream and respective track,
           which the media player needs to decode the media frames.

         o GetMP4MediaFragment: Retrieves MP4 media fragments. These fragments
           contain  the  "moof  " and "mdat " MP4 atoms and their child atoms,
           containing the encoded fragment's  media  frames  and  their  time-
           stamps.

         NOTE:
                After  the first media fragment is made available in a stream-
                ing session, any fragments that don't contain the  same  codec
                private  data cause an error to be returned when those differ-
                ent media fragments are loaded. Therefore, the  codec  private
                data  should  not  change between fragments in a session. This
                also means that the session fails if the fragments in a stream
                change from having only video to having both audio and video.

            Data  retrieved  with this action is billable. See Pricing for de-
            tails.

       NOTE:
          For restrictions that apply to MPEG-DASH sessions, see Kinesis Video
          Streams Limits .

       You  can  monitor  the amount of data that the media player consumes by
       monitoring the GetMP4MediaFragment.OutgoingBytes Amazon CloudWatch met-
       ric.  For  information  about using CloudWatch to monitor Kinesis Video
       Streams, see Monitoring Kinesis Video Streams .  For  pricing  informa-

       WARNING:
          If  an  error  is  thrown  after  invoking  a  Kinesis Video Streams
          archived media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the  re-
          sponse body, it includes the following pieces of information:

          o x-amz-ErrorType  HTTP  header  contains a more specific error type
            in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

          o x-amz-RequestId HTTP header  if you want to  report  an  issue  to
            AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
            Request Id.

          Both the HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can  be  utilized
          to  make  programmatic decisions about whether errors are retry-able
          and under what conditions, as well as provide  information  on  what
          actions  the  client  programmer might need to take in order to suc-
          cessfully try again.

          [--stream-name <value>]
          [--stream-arn <value>]
          [--playback-mode <value>]
          [--display-fragment-timestamp <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stream-name (string)
          The  name of the stream for which to retrieve the MPEG-DASH manifest
          URL.

          You must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN .

       --stream-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stream for which  to  retrieve
          the MPEG-DASH manifest URL.

          You must specify either the StreamName or the StreamARN .

       --playback-mode (string)
          Whether to retrieve live, live replay, or archived, on-demand data.

          Features of the three types of sessions include the following:

          o

            **
            LIVE  **  :  For  sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is
            continually updated with  the  latest  fragments  as  they  become
            available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new mani-
            fest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is played
            in  a media player, the user interface typically displays a "live"
            notification, with no scrubber control for choosing  the  position
            in the playback window to display.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 188)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          NOTE:
              In  LIVE mode, the newest available fragments are included in an
              MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is  a  gap  between  fragments
              (that is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause
              a media player to halt or cause a  jump  in  playback.  In  this
              mode,  fragments are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they
              are older than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the miss-
              ing  fragment  becomes  available after a subsequent fragment is
              added to the manifest, the older fragment is not added, and  the
              gap is not filled.

          o

            **
            LIVE_REPLAY ** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest
            is updated similarly to how it is updated  for  LIVE  mode  except
            that it starts by including fragments from a given start time. In-
            stead of fragments being added as they are ingested, fragments are
            added  as  the duration of the next fragment elapses. For example,
            if the fragments in the session are two seconds long, then  a  new
            fragment  is added to the manifest every two seconds. This mode is
            useful to be able to start playback from when an event is detected
            and  continue  live streaming media that has not yet been ingested
            as of the time of the session creation. This mode is  also  useful
            to  stream  previously archived media without being limited by the
            1,000 fragment limit in the ON_DEMAND mode.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 196)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          o

            **
            ON_DEMAND ** : For sessions of this type, the  MPEG-DASH  manifest
            contains  all the fragments for the session, up to the number that
            is specified in MaxManifestFragmentResults . The manifest must  be
            retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is
            played in a media player, the user interface typically displays  a
            scrubber  control for choosing the position in the playback window
            to display.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 198)
            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          In all playback modes, if FragmentSelectorType is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP
          , and if there are multiple fragments with the same start timestamp,
          the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that is, the newer
          fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other fragments
          are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but  have
          overlapping  durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest.
          This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.

          The default is LIVE .

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o LIVE_REPLAY

          o ON_DEMAND

       --display-fragment-timestamp (string)
          Per the MPEG-DASH specification, the wall-clock time of fragments in
          the  manifest  file  can be derived using attributes in the manifest
          itself. However, typically, MPEG-DASH compatible  media  players  do
          not  properly  handle  gaps  in  the  media  timeline. Kinesis Video
          Streams adjusts the media timeline in the manifest  file  to  enable
          playback  of  media  with discontinuities. Therefore, the wall-clock
          time derived from the manifest  file  may  be  inaccurate.  If  Dis-
          playFragmentTimestamp is set to ALWAYS , the accurate fragment time-
          stamp is added to each S element in the manifest file with  the  at-
          tribute name kvs:ts. A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary to
          leverage this custom attribute.

          The  default  value  is  NEVER  .  When    DASHFragmentSelector   is
          SERVER_TIMESTAMP  ,  the  timestamps  will be the server start time-
          stamps. Similarly, when  DASHFragmentSelector is  PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP
          , the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.

          Possible values:

          o ALWAYS

          o NEVER

       --display-fragment-number (string)
          Fragments  are  identified  in  the manifest file based on their se-
          quence number in the session. If DisplayFragmentNumber is set to AL-
          WAYS  , the Kinesis Video Streams fragment number is added to each S
          element in the manifest file with the attribute name  kvs:fn.  These
          fragment  numbers can be used for logging or for use with other APIs
          (e.g. GetMedia and GetMediaForFragmentList ). A custom MPEG-DASH me-
          dia player is necessary to leverage these this custom attribute.

          The default value is NEVER .

          Possible values:

          o ALWAYS

          o NEVER

       --dash-fragment-selector (structure)
          The time range of the requested fragment and the source of the time-
          stamps.

          This parameter is required if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or  LIVE_RE-
          PLAY . This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is LIVE . If Play-
          backMode is LIVE , the FragmentSelectorType  can  be  set,  but  the
          TimestampRange  should  not  be set. If PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or
          LIVE_REPLAY , both FragmentSelectorType and TimestampRange  must  be
          set.

          FragmentSelectorType -> (string)
              The source of the timestamps for the requested media.

              When FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and  Get-
              DASHStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode   is   ON_DEMAND    or
              LIVE_REPLAY  , the first fragment ingested with a producer time-
              stamp within the specified   FragmentSelector$TimestampRange  is
              included  in the media playlist. In addition, the fragments with
              producer timestamps within the TimestampRange  ingested  immedi-
              ately  following  the  first fragment (up to the  GetDASHStream-
              ingSessionURLInput$MaxManifestFragmentResults  value)  are   in-
              cluded.

              Fragments  that  have duplicate producer timestamps are dedupli-
              cated. This means that if producers are producing  a  stream  of
              fragments  with producer timestamps that are approximately equal
              to the true clock time, the MPEG-DASH manifest will contain  all
              of  the  fragments within the requested timestamp range. If some
              fragments are ingested within the same time range and very  dif-
              ferent  points  in  time, only the oldest ingested collection of
              fragments are returned.

              When FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and  Get-
              DASHStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is LIVE , the producer
              timestamps are used in the MP4 fragments and for  deduplication.
              But  the  most recently ingested fragments based on server time-
              stamps are included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. This  means  that
              even  if fragments ingested in the past have producer timestamps
              with values  now,  they  are  not  included  in  the  HLS  media
              playlist.

              The default is SERVER_TIMESTAMP .

          TimestampRange -> (structure)
              The  start  and end of the timestamp range for the requested me-
              dia.

              This value should not be present if PlaybackType is LIVE .

              StartTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The start of the timestamp range for the requested media.

                 If the DASHTimestampRange value is specified, the StartTimes-
                 tamp value is required.

                 Only  fragments that start exactly at or after StartTimestamp
                 are included in the  session.  Fragments  that  start  before
                 StartTimestamp  and  continue  past it aren't included in the
                 session. If FragmentSelectorType is  SERVER_TIMESTAMP  ,  the
                 StartTimestamp must be later than the stream head.

              EndTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This
                 value must be within 24 hours of the specified StartTimestamp
                 , and it must be later than the StartTimestamp value.

                 If FragmentSelectorType for the request is SERVER_TIMESTAMP ,
                 this value must be in the past.

                 The EndTimestamp value is required for  ON_DEMAND  mode,  but
                 optional for LIVE_REPLAY mode. If the EndTimestamp is not set
                 for LIVE_REPLAY mode then the session will  continue  to  in-
                 clude newly ingested fragments until the session expires.

                 NOTE:
                     This  value is inclusive. The EndTimestamp is compared to
                     the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments  that
                     start  before the EndTimestamp value and continue past it
                     are included in the session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          FragmentSelectorType=string,TimestampRange={StartTimestamp=timestamp,EndTimestamp=timestamp}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "FragmentSelectorType": "PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP"|"SERVER_TIMESTAMP",
            "TimestampRange": {
              "StartTimestamp": timestamp,
              "EndTimestamp": timestamp
            }
          }

       --expires (integer)
          The time in seconds until the requested session expires. This  value
          can be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).

          When   a   session  expires,  no  new  calls  to  GetDashManifest  ,
          GetMP4InitFragment , or GetMP4MediaFragment can  be  made  for  that
          session.

          The default is 300 (5 minutes).

       --max-manifest-fragment-results (long)
          The  maximum  number of fragments that are returned in the MPEG-DASH
          manifest.

          When the PlaybackMode is LIVE , the most recent  fragments  are  re-
          turned  up  to  this value. When the PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND , the
          oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.

          When there are a higher number of  fragments  available  in  a  live
          MPEG-DASH manifest, video players often buffer content before start-
          ing playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback  la-
          tency,  but  it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur
          during playback. We recommend that a live MPEG-DASH manifest have  a
          minimum of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.

          The  default is 5 fragments if PlaybackMode is LIVE or LIVE_REPLAY ,
          and 1,000 if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND .

          The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds  to  more  than  16
          minutes of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2
          1/2 hours of video on streams with 10-second fragments.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DASHStreamingSessionURL -> (string)
          The  URL  (containing the session token) that a media player can use
          to retrieve the MPEG-DASH manifest.



                                              GET-DASH-STREAMING-SESSION-URL()
