GET-MEDIA-FOR-FRAGMENT-LIST()                    GET-MEDIA-FOR-FRAGMENT-LIST()



NAME
       get-media-for-fragment-list -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  media for a list of fragments (specified by fragment number) from
       the archived data in an Amazon Kinesis video stream.

       NOTE:
          You must first call the GetDataEndpoint API to get an endpoint. Then
          send the GetMediaForFragmentList requests to this endpoint using the
          --endpoint-url parameter .

       For limits, see Kinesis Video Streams Limits .

       WARNING:
          If an error  is  thrown  after  invoking  a  Kinesis  Video  Streams
          archived  media API, in addition to the HTTP status code and the re-
          sponse body, it includes the following pieces of information:

          o x-amz-ErrorType HTTP header  contains a more specific  error  type
            in addition to what the HTTP status code provides.

          o x-amz-RequestId  HTTP  header   if  you want to report an issue to
            AWS, the support team can better diagnose the problem if given the
            Request Id.

          Both  the  HTTP status code and the ErrorType header can be utilized
          to make programmatic decisions about whether errors  are  retry-able
          and  under  what  conditions, as well as provide information on what
          actions the client programmer might need to take in  order  to  suc-
          cessfully try again.

          For  more  information, see the Errors section at the bottom of this
          topic, as well as Common Errors .

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_FRAGMENT_NUMBER - The number of the fragment that
            threw the exception

          o AWS_KINESISVIDEO_EXCEPTION_ERROR_CODE - The integer  code  of  the
