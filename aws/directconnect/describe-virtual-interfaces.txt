NAME
       describe-virtual-interfaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays  all  virtual  interfaces  for an Amazon Web Services account.
       Virtual interfaces deleted fewer than 15 minutes before  you  make  the
       request  are  also  returned.  If you specify a connection ID, only the
       virtual interfaces associated with the connection are returned. If  you
       specify a virtual interface ID, then only a single virtual interface is
       returned.

       A virtual interface (VLAN) transmits the  traffic  between  the  Direct
       Connect location and the customer network.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-virtual-interfaces
          [--connection-id <value>]
          [--virtual-interface-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the connection.

       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 o confirming : The creation of the virtual interface is pend-
                   ing confirmation from the virtual interface owner.  If  the
                   owner  of the virtual interface is different from the owner
                   of the connection on which it is provisioned, then the vir-
                   tual  interface  will remain in this state until it is con-
                   firmed by the virtual interface owner.

                 o verifying : This state only applies to public  virtual  in-
                   terfaces.  Each  public  virtual interface needs validation
                   before the virtual interface can be created.

                 o pending : A virtual interface is in  this  state  from  the
                   time  that  it  is  created  until the virtual interface is
                   ready to forward traffic.

                 o available : A virtual interface that  is  able  to  forward
                   traffic.

                 o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

                 o deleting : A virtual interface is in this state immediately
                   after  calling   DeleteVirtualInterface  until  it  can  no
                   longer forward traffic.

                 o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

                 o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined cre-
                   ation of the virtual interface. If a virtual  interface  in
                   the  Confirming  state  is deleted by the virtual interface
                   owner, the virtual interface enters the Rejected state.

                 o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not  avail-
                   able.

              customerRouterConfig -> (string)
                 The customer router configuration.

              mtu -> (integer)
                 The  maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported
                 values are 1500 and 9001. The default value is 1500.

              jumboFrameCapable -> (boolean)

              virtualGatewayId -> (string)
                 The ID of the virtual private gateway. Applies only  to  pri-
                 vate virtual interfaces.

              directConnectGatewayId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

              routeFilterPrefixes -> (list)

                 work in this Region. Applies to public virtual interfaces.

                 (structure)
                     Information about a route filter prefix that  a  customer

                        sible values:

                        o verifying : The BGP peering addresses or ASN require
                          validation  before the BGP peer can be created. This
                          state applies only to public virtual interfaces.

                        o pending : The BGP peer is created,  and  remains  in
                          this state until it is ready to be established.

                          not indicate the state of the routing function.  En-
                          sure that you are receiving routes over the BGP ses-
