DESCRIBE-CONNECTIONS()                                  DESCRIBE-CONNECTIONS()



NAME
       describe-connections -

DESCRIPTION
       Displays the specified connection or all connections in this Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-connections
          [--connection-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the connection.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all connections in the current region

       The following describe-connections command lists all connections in the
       current region:

                   sioned on an interconnect. The connection stays in the  or-

                   firms or declines the connection order.

                 o requested : The initial state of a standard connection. The
                   connection stays in the requested state until the Letter of
                   Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.

                 o pending : The connection has been  approved  and  is  being

                 o deleted : The connection has been deleted.

                 o rejected : A hosted connection in the ordering state enters
                   the rejected state if it is deleted by the customer.
