DESCRIBE-VIRTUAL-GATEWAYS()                        DESCRIBE-VIRTUAL-GATEWAYS()



NAME
       describe-virtual-gateways -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the virtual private gateways owned by the Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       You can create one or more Direct Connect  private  virtual  interfaces
       linked to a virtual private gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-virtual-gateways
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list virtual private gateways

       The  following  describe-virtual-gateways command lists virtual private
       gateways owned by your AWS account:

          aws directconnect describe-virtual-gateways

       Output:

          {
              "virtualGateways": [
                  {
                      "virtualGatewayId": "vgw-aba37db6",
                      "virtualGatewayState": "available"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       virtualGateways -> (list)
          The virtual private gateways.

          (structure)
              Information about a virtual private gateway for a  private  vir-
              tual interface.

              virtualGatewayId -> (string)
                 The ID of the virtual private gateway.

              virtualGatewayState -> (string)
                 The  state  of the virtual private gateway. The following are
                 the possible values:

                 o pending : Initial state after creating the virtual  private
                   gateway.

                 o available : Ready for use by a private virtual interface.

                 o deleting : Initial state after deleting the virtual private
                   gateway.

                 o deleted : The virtual private gateway is deleted. The  pri-
                   vate  virtual interface is unable to send traffic over this
                   gateway.
