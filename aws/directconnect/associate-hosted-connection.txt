ASSOCIATE-HOSTED-CONNECTION()                    ASSOCIATE-HOSTED-CONNECTION()



NAME
       associate-hosted-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Associates  a  hosted connection and its virtual interfaces with a link
       aggregation group (LAG) or interconnect. If the target interconnect  or
       LAG has an existing hosted connection with a conflicting VLAN number or
       IP address, the operation fails. This action temporarily interrupts the
       hosted  connection's connectivity to Amazon Web Services as it is being
       migrated.

       NOTE:
          Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-hosted-connection
          --connection-id <value>
          --parent-connection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the hosted connection.

       --parent-connection-id (string)
          The ID of the interconnect or the LAG.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
