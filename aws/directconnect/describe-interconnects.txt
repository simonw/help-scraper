DESCRIBE-INTERCONNECTS()                              DESCRIBE-INTERCONNECTS()



NAME
       describe-interconnects -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  interconnects  owned  by the Amazon Web Services account or
       only the specified interconnect.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-interconnects
          [--interconnect-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --interconnect-id (string)
          The ID of the interconnect.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list interconnects

       The  following  describe-interconnects  command lists the interconnects
       owned by your AWS account:

          aws directconnect describe-interconnects

       Output:

          {
              "interconnects": [
                  {
                      "region": "sa-east-1",
                      "bandwidth": "1Gbps",
                      "location": "TIVIT",
                      "interconnectName": "1G Interconnect to AWS",
                      "interconnectId": "dxcon-fgktov66",
                      "interconnectState": "down"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       interconnects -> (list)
          The interconnects.

          (structure)
              Information about an interconnect.

              interconnectId -> (string)
                 The ID of the interconnect.

              interconnectName -> (string)
                 The name of the interconnect.

              interconnectState -> (string)
                 The state of the interconnect. The following are the possible
                 values:

                 o requested  :  The initial state of an interconnect. The in-
                   terconnect stays in the requested state until the Letter of
                   Authorization (LOA) is sent to the customer.

                 o pending  :  The interconnect is approved, and is being ini-
                   tialized.

                 o available : The network link is up, and the interconnect is
                   ready for use.

                 o down : The network link is down.

                 o deleting : The interconnect is being deleted.

                 o deleted : The interconnect is deleted.

                 o unknown : The state of the interconnect is not available.

              region -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services Region where the connection is lo-
                 cated.

              location -> (string)
                 The location of the connection.

              bandwidth -> (string)
                 The bandwidth of the connection.

              loaIssueTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the most recent call  to   DescribeLoa  for  this
                 connection.

              lagId -> (string)
                 The ID of the LAG.

              awsDevice -> (string)
                 The  Direct Connect endpoint on which the physical connection
                 terminates.

              jumboFrameCapable -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether jumbo frames (9001 MTU) are supported.

              awsDeviceV2 -> (string)
                 The Direct Connect endpoint that terminates the physical con-
                 nection.

              awsLogicalDeviceId -> (string)
                 The  Direct Connect endpoint that terminates the logical con-
                 nection. This device might be different than the device  that
                 terminates the physical connection.

              hasLogicalRedundancy -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  the interconnect supports a secondary BGP
                 in the same address family (IPv4/IPv6).

              tags -> (list)
                 The tags associated with the interconnect.
