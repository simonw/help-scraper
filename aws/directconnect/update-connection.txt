UPDATE-CONNECTION()                                        UPDATE-CONNECTION()



NAME
       update-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates the Direct Connect dedicated connection configuration.

       You can update the following parameters for a connection:

       o The connection name

       o The connection's MAC Security (MACsec) encryption mode.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-connection
          --connection-id <value>
          [--connection-name <value>]
          [--encryption-mode <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the dedicated connection.

          You can use  DescribeConnections to retrieve the connection ID.

       --connection-name (string)
          The name of the connection.

       --encryption-mode (string)
          The connection MAC Security (MACsec) encryption mode.

          The  valid values are no_encrypt , should_encrypt , and must_encrypt
          .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          o deleted : The connection has been deleted.

          o rejected  :  A  hosted connection in the ordering state enters the
