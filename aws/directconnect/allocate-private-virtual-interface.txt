NAME
       allocate-private-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Provisions  a  private  virtual  interface to be owned by the specified
       Amazon Web Services account.

       Virtual interfaces created using this action must be confirmed  by  the
       owner  using   ConfirmPrivateVirtualInterface . Until then, the virtual
       interface is in the Confirming state and is  not  available  to  handle
       traffic.

            "vlan": integer,
            "asn": integer,
            "mtu": integer,
            "authKey": "string",
            "amazonAddress": "string",
            "addressFamily": "ipv4"|"ipv6",
            "customerAddress": "string",
            "tags": [
              {
                "key": "string",

            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI

            firmation from the virtual interface owner. If the  owner  of  the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying  : This state only applies to public virtual interfaces.
            Each public virtual interface needs validation before the  virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending  : A virtual interface is in this state from the time that
            it is created until the virtual  interface  is  ready  to  forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting  : A virtual interface is in this state immediately after
            calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it  can  no  longer  forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected  :  The  virtual interface owner has declined creation of
            the virtual interface. If a virtual interface  in  the  Confirming
            state  is  deleted by the virtual interface owner, the virtual in-
            terface enters the Rejected state.

          o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.

          The customer router configuration.

       mtu -> (integer)

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.
