NAME
       create-private-virtual-interface -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  private  virtual interface. A virtual interface is the VLAN
       that transports Direct Connect traffic. A private virtual interface can
       be  connected  to  either a Direct Connect gateway or a Virtual Private
       Gateway (VGW). Connecting the private virtual  interface  to  a  Direct
       Connect  gateway  enables  the  possibility  for connecting to multiple
       VPCs, including VPCs in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Connect-
       ing  the  private  virtual interface to a VGW only provides access to a
       single VPC within the same Region.

       Setting the MTU of a virtual interface to 9001 (jumbo frames) can cause
       an update to the underlying physical connection if it wasn't updated to
       support jumbo frames. Updating the connection disrupts network  connec-
       tivity for all virtual interfaces associated with the connection for up
       to 30 seconds. To check whether your connection supports jumbo  frames,
       call   DescribeConnections  .  To  check whether your virtual interface
       supports jumbo frames, call  DescribeVirtualInterfaces .

          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's

            firmation  from  the  virtual interface owner. If the owner of the
            virtual interface is different from the owner of the connection on
            which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface will remain in
            this state until it is confirmed by the virtual interface owner.

          o verifying : This state only applies to public virtual  interfaces.
            Each  public virtual interface needs validation before the virtual
            interface can be created.

          o pending : A virtual interface is in this state from the time  that
            it  is  created  until  the  virtual interface is ready to forward
            traffic.

          o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward traffic.

          o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

          o deleting : A virtual interface is in this state immediately  after
            calling   DeleteVirtualInterface  until  it  can no longer forward
            traffic.

          o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

          o rejected : The virtual interface owner has  declined  creation  of
            the  virtual  interface.  If a virtual interface in the Confirming
            state is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the  virtual  in-
            terface enters the Rejected state.

          The customer router configuration.

       mtu -> (integer)
          The  maximum transmission unit (MTU), in bytes. The supported values

              cidr -> (string)
                 The CIDR block for the advertised  route.  Separate  multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

                 values:

                 o verifying  : The BGP peering addresses or ASN require vali-
                   dation before the BGP peer can be created. This  state  ap-
                   plies only to public virtual interfaces.
