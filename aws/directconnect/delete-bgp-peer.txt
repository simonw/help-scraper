NAME
       delete-bgp-peer -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the specified BGP peer on the specified virtual interface with
       the specified customer address and ASN.

       You cannot delete the last BGP peer from a virtual interface.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-bgp-peer
          [--virtual-interface-id <value>]
          [--asn <value>]
          [--customer-address <value>]
          [--bgp-peer-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --virtual-interface-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual interface.

       --asn (integer)
          The autonomous system (AS) number for Border Gateway Protocol  (BGP)
          configuration.

       --customer-address (string)
          The IP address assigned to the customer interface.

       --bgp-peer-id (string)
          The ID of the BGP peer.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              o confirming  : The creation of the virtual interface is pending
                confirmation from the virtual interface owner. If the owner of
                the  virtual interface is different from the owner of the con-
                nection on which it is provisioned, then the virtual interface
                will remain in this state until it is confirmed by the virtual
                interface owner.

              o verifying : This state only applies to public  virtual  inter-
                faces.  Each  public virtual interface needs validation before
                the virtual interface can be created.

              o pending : A virtual interface is in this state from  the  time
                that  it  is  created  until the virtual interface is ready to
                forward traffic.

              o available : A virtual interface that is able to forward  traf-
                fic.

              o down : A virtual interface that is BGP down.

              o deleting  :  A  virtual interface is in this state immediately
                after calling  DeleteVirtualInterface until it can  no  longer
                forward traffic.

              o deleted : A virtual interface that cannot forward traffic.

              o rejected  :  The virtual interface owner has declined creation
                of the virtual interface. If a virtual interface in  the  Con-
                firming  state  is deleted by the virtual interface owner, the
                virtual interface enters the Rejected state.

              o unknown : The state of the virtual interface is not available.

          customerRouterConfig -> (string)
              The customer router configuration.

          routeFilterPrefixes -> (list)
              The routes to be advertised to the Amazon Web  Services  network
              in this Region. Applies to public virtual interfaces.

              (structure)
                 Information  about  a route filter prefix that a customer can
                 advertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a public
                 virtual interface.

                 cidr -> (string)
                     The  CIDR block for the advertised route. Separate multi-

                     ble values:

                     o up : The BGP peer is established. This state  does  not
