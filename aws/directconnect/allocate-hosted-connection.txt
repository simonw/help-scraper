ALLOCATE-HOSTED-CONNECTION()                      ALLOCATE-HOSTED-CONNECTION()



NAME
       allocate-hosted-connection -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a hosted connection on the specified interconnect or a link ag-
       gregation group (LAG) of interconnects.

       Allocates a VLAN number and a specified amount of capacity  (bandwidth)
       for  use by a hosted connection on the specified interconnect or LAG of
       interconnects. Amazon Web Services polices the  hosted  connection  for
       the  specified capacity and the Direct Connect Partner must also police
       the hosted connection for the specified capacity.

       NOTE:
          Intended for use by Direct Connect Partners only.

SYNOPSIS
            allocate-hosted-connection
          --connection-id <value>
          --owner-account <value>
          --bandwidth <value>
          --connection-name <value>
          --vlan <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connection-id (string)
          The ID of the interconnect or LAG.

       --owner-account (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account ID of the customer for the
          connection.

       --bandwidth (string)
          The  bandwidth  of  the  connection. The possible values are 50Mbps,
          100Mbps, 200Mbps, 300Mbps, 400Mbps, 500Mbps,  1Gbps,  2Gbps,  5Gbps,
          and  10Gbps.  Note  that only those Direct Connect Partners who have
          met specific requirements are allowed  to  create  a  1Gbps,  2Gbps,
          5Gbps or 10Gbps hosted connection.

       --connection-name (string)
          The name of the hosted connection.

       --vlan (integer)
          The dedicated VLAN provisioned to the hosted connection.

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the connection.

          (structure)
              Information about a tag.

              key -> (string)
                 The key.

              value -> (string)
                 The value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
