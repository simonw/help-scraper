CREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCCREATE-DIRECT-CONNECT-GATEWAY-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-direct-connect-gateway-association -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  association between a Direct Connect gateway and a virtual
       private gateway. The virtual private gateway must be attached to a  VPC
       and must not be associated with another Direct Connect gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-direct-connect-gateway-association
          --direct-connect-gateway-id <value>
          [--gateway-id <value>]
          [--add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway <value>]
          [--virtual-gateway-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --direct-connect-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the Direct Connect gateway.

       --gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private gateway or transit gateway.

       --add-allowed-prefixes-to-direct-connect-gateway (list)
          The Amazon VPC prefixes to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway

          This parameter is required when you create an association to a tran-
          sit gateway.

          For information about how to set the prefixes, see Allowed  Prefixes
          in the Direct Connect User Guide .

          (structure)
              Information  about a route filter prefix that a customer can ad-
              vertise through Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) over a public vir-
              tual interface.

              cidr -> (string)
                 The  CIDR  block  for the advertised route. Separate multiple
                 routes using commas. An IPv6 CIDR must use /64 or shorter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          cidr=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "cidr": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --virtual-gateway-id (string)
          The ID of the virtual private gateway.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To associate a virtual private gateway with a Direct Connect gateway

       The  following  example associates virtual private gateway vgw-6efe725e
       with Direct Connect  gateway  5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample.  You
       must run the command in the region in which the virtual private gateway
       is located.

       Command:

          aws directconnect create-direct-connect-gateway-association --direct-connect-gateway-id 5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample --virtual-gateway-id vgw-6efe725e

       Output:

          {
            "directConnectGatewayAssociation": {
                "associationState": "associating",
                "virtualGatewayOwnerAccount": "123456789012",
                "directConnectGatewayId": "5f294f92-bafb-4011-916d-9b0bexample",
                "virtualGatewayId": "vgw-6efe725e",
                "virtualGatewayRegion": "us-east-2"
            }
          }
