GET-CORS-POLICY()                                            GET-CORS-POLICY()



NAME
       get-cors-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) configuration informa-
       tion that is set for the container.

       To use this operation, you must have permission to perform the  MediaS-
       tore:GetCorsPolicy  action.  By  default,  the container owner has this
       permission and can grant it to others.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-cors-policy
          --container-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that the policy is assigned to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a CORS policy

       The  following  get-cors-policy  example  displays the cross-origin re-
       source sharing (CORS) policy that is assigned  to  the  specified  con-
       tainer.

          aws mediastore get-cors-policy \
              --container-name ExampleContainer \
              --region us-west-2

       Output:

          {
              "CorsPolicy": [
                  {
                      "AllowedMethods": [
                          "GET",
                          "HEAD"
                      ],
                      "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000,
                      "AllowedOrigins": [
                          ""
                      ],
                      "AllowedHeaders": [
                          ""
                      ]
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       CorsPolicy -> (list)
          The CORS policy assigned to the container.

          (structure)
              A rule for a CORS policy. You can add up to 100 rules to a  CORS
              policy.  If  more  than  one  rule applies, the service uses the
              first applicable rule listed.

              AllowedOrigins -> (list)
                 One or more response headers that you want users to  be  able
                 to  access from their applications (for example, from a Java-
                 Script XMLHttpRequest object).

                 Each CORS rule must have at least one AllowedOrigins element.
                 The string value can include only one wildcard character (*),
                 for example, http://
                 *
                 .example.com. Additionally, you can specify only one wildcard
                 character to allow cross-origin access for all origins.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 129)
                        Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                        (string)

              AllowedMethods -> (list)
                 Identifies  an  HTTP method that the origin that is specified
                 in the rule is allowed to execute.

                 Each CORS rule must contain at least one  AllowedMethods  and
                 one AllowedOrigins element.

                 (string)

              AllowedHeaders -> (list)
                 Specifies  which  headers  are allowed in a preflight OPTIONS
                 request through  the  Access-Control-Request-Headers  header.
                 Each  header  name  that  is  specified in Access-Control-Re-
                 quest-Headers must have a corresponding entry  in  the  rule.
                 Only the headers that were requested are sent back.

                 This element can contain only one wildcard character (*).

                 (string)

              MaxAgeSeconds -> (integer)
                 The  time  in  seconds that your browser caches the preflight
                 response for the specified resource.

                 A CORS rule can have only one MaxAgeSeconds element.

              ExposeHeaders -> (list)
                 One or more headers in the response that you want users to be
                 able  to  access from their applications (for example, from a
                 JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object).

                 This element is optional for each rule.
