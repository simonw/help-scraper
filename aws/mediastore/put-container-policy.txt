PUT-CONTAINER-POLICY()                                  PUT-CONTAINER-POLICY()



NAME
       put-container-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  an  access  policy for the specified container to restrict the
       users and clients that can access it. For information  about  the  data
       that  is  included in an access policy, see the AWS Identity and Access
       Management User Guide .

       For this release of the REST API, you can create only one policy for  a
       container.  If  you  enter PutContainerPolicy twice, the second command
       modifies the existing policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-container-policy
          --container-name <value>
          --policy <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container.

       --policy (string)
          The contents of the policy, which includes the following:

          o One Version tag

          o One Statement tag that contains the standard tags for the policy.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To edit a container policy

       The following put-container-policy example assigns a  different  policy
       to  the specified container. In this example, the updated policy is de-
       fined in a file named LiveEventsContainerPolicy.json.

          aws mediastore put-container-policy \
              --container-name LiveEvents \
              --policy file://LiveEventsContainerPolicy.json

       This command produces no output.

       tal MediaStore User Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
