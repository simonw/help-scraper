GET-METRIC-POLICY()                                        GET-METRIC-POLICY()



NAME
       get-metric-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the metric policy for the specified container.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-metric-policy
          --container-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container that is associated with the metric policy.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MetricPolicy -> (structure)
          The metric policy that is associated with the specific container.

          ContainerLevelMetrics -> (string)
              A setting to enable or disable metrics at the container level.

          MetricPolicyRules -> (list)
              A  parameter that holds an array of rules that enable metrics at
              the object level. This parameter is optional, but if you  choose
              to  include  it, you must also include at least one rule. By de-
              fault, you can include up to five rules. You can also request  a
              quota increase to allow up to 300 rules per policy.

              (structure)
                 A setting that enables metrics at the object level. Each rule
                 contains an object group and an object  group  name.  If  the
                 policy includes the MetricPolicyRules parameter, you must in-
                 clude at least one rule. Each metric policy can include up to
                 five  rules by default. You can also request a quota increase
                 to allow up to 300 rules per policy.

                 ObjectGroup -> (string)
                     A path or file name that defines which objects to include
                     in the group. Wildcards (*) are acceptable.

                 ObjectGroupName -> (string)
                     A name that allows you to refer to the object group.
