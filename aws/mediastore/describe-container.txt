DESCRIBE-CONTAINER()                                      DESCRIBE-CONTAINER()



NAME
       describe-container -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  properties  of the requested container. This request is
       commonly used to retrieve the endpoint of a container. An endpoint is a
       value  assigned  by the service when a new container is created. A con-
       tainer's endpoint does not change after it has been assigned.  The  De-
       scribeContainer request returns a single Container object based on Con-
       tainerName . To return all Container objects that are associated with a
       specified AWS account, use  ListContainers .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-container
          [--container-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --container-name (string)
          The name of the container to query.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view the details of a container

       The  following  describe-container  example displays the details of the
       specified container.

          aws mediastore describe-container \
              --container-name ExampleContainer

       Output:

          {
              "Container": {
                  "CreationTime": 1563558086,
                  "AccessLoggingEnabled": false,
                  "ARN": "arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:container/ExampleContainer",
                  "Status": "ACTIVE",
                  "Name": "ExampleContainer",
                  "Endpoint": "https://aaabbbcccdddee.data.mediastore.us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
              }
          }

       AWS Elemental MediaStore User Guide.

OUTPUT
       Container -> (structure)
          The name of the queried container.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              The  DNS endpoint of the container. Use the endpoint to identify
              the specific container when sending requests to the data  plane.
              The  service  assigns  this value when the container is created.
              Once the value has been assigned, it does not change.

          CreationTime -> (timestamp)
              Unix timestamp.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the container. The ARN has the
              following format:

              arn:aws:<region>:<account   that   owns   this   container>:con-
              tainer/<name of container>

              For   example:    arn:aws:mediastore:us-west-2:111122223333:con-
              tainer/movies

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the container.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status of container creation or deletion. The status is one
              of the following: CREATING , ACTIVE , or DELETING  .  While  the
              service is creating the container, the status is CREATING . When
              the endpoint is available, the status changes to ACTIVE .

          AccessLoggingEnabled -> (boolean)
              The state of access logging on  the  container.  This  value  is
              false  by default, indicating that AWS Elemental MediaStore does
              not send access logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. When you  enable
              access  logging  on the container, MediaStore changes this value
              to true , indicating that the service delivers access  logs  for
              objects stored in that container to CloudWatch Logs.
