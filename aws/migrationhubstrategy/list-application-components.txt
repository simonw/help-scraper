LIST-APPLICATION-COMPONENTS()                    LIST-APPLICATION-COMPONENTS()



NAME
       list-application-components -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves a list of all the application components (processes).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-application-components  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: applicationComponentInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-application-components
          [--application-component-criteria <value>]
          [--filter-value <value>]
          [--group-id-filter <value>]
          [--sort <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --application-component-criteria (string)
          Criteria for filtering the list of application components.

          Possible values:

          o NOT_DEFINED

          o APP_NAME

          o SERVER_ID

          o APP_TYPE

          o STRATEGY

          o DESTINATION

       --filter-value (string)
          Specify the value based on the application component criteria  type.
          For example, if applicationComponentCriteria is set to SERVER_ID and
          filterValue is set to server1 , then  ListApplicationComponents  re-
          turns all the application components running on server1.

       --group-id-filter (list)
          The group ID specified in to filter on.

          (structure)
              The  object  containing  information  about  distinct imports or
              groups for Strategy Recommendations.

              name -> (string)
                 The key of the specific import group.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the specific import group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "ExternalId",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort (string)
          Specifies whether to sort by ascending (ASC ) or descending (DESC  )
          order.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

          o DESC

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
