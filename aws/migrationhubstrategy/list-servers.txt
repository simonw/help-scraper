LIST-SERVERS()                                                  LIST-SERVERS()



NAME
       list-servers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all the servers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-servers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: serverInfos

SYNOPSIS
            list-servers
          [--filter-value <value>]
          [--group-id-filter <value>]
          [--server-criteria <value>]
          [--sort <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filter-value (string)
          Specifies the filter value, which is based on  the  type  of  server
          criteria.  For  example, if serverCriteria is OS_NAME , and the fil-
          terValue is equal to WindowsServer , then ListServers returns all of
          the servers matching the OS name WindowsServer .

       --group-id-filter (list)
          Specifies the group ID to filter on.

          (structure)
              The  object  containing  information  about  distinct imports or
              groups for Strategy Recommendations.

              name -> (string)
                 The key of the specific import group.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the specific import group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "ExternalId",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --server-criteria (string)
          Criteria for filtering servers.

          Possible values:

          o NOT_DEFINED

          o OS_NAME

          o STRATEGY

          o DESTINATION

          o SERVER_ID

       --sort (string)
          Specifies whether to sort by ascending (ASC ) or descending (DESC  )
          order.

          Possible values:

          o ASC

          o DESC

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
