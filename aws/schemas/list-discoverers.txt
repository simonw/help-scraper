LIST-DISCOVERERS()                                          LIST-DISCOVERERS()



NAME
       list-discoverers -

DESCRIPTION
       List the discoverers.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-discoverers  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Discoverers

SYNOPSIS
            list-discoverers
          [--discoverer-id-prefix <value>]
          [--source-arn-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --discoverer-id-prefix (string)
          Specifying this limits the results to only those discoverer IDs that
          start with the specified prefix.

       --source-arn-prefix (string)
          Specifying  this  limits  the  results to only those ARNs that start
          with the specified prefix.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Discoverers -> (list)
          An array of DiscovererSummary information.

          (structure)
              DiscovererArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the discoverer.

              DiscovererId -> (string)
                 The ID of the discoverer.

              SourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the event bus.

              State -> (string)
                 The state of the discoverer.

              CrossAccount -> (boolean)
                 The Status if  the  discoverer  will  discover  schemas  from
                 events sent from another account.

              Tags -> (map)
                 Tags associated with the resource.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token that specifies the next page of results to return. To re-
          quest the first page, leave NextToken empty. The token  will  expire
          in 24 hours, and cannot be shared with other accounts.
