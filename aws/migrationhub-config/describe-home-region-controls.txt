DESCRIPTION
       This API permits filtering on the ControlId and HomeRegion fields.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-home-region-controls
          [--control-id <value>]
          [--home-region <value>]
          [--target <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --control-id (string)
          The  ControlID  is a unique identifier string of your HomeRegionCon-
          trol object.

       --home-region (string)
          The name of the home region you'd like to view.

       --target (structure)
          The target parameter specifies the identifier to which the home  re-
          gion  is  applied,  which is always of type ACCOUNT . It applies the
          home region to the current ACCOUNT .

          Type -> (string)
              The target type is always an ACCOUNT .

          Id -> (string)
              The TargetID is a 12-character identifier  of  the  ACCOUNT  for
              which  the  control  was  created. (This must be the current ac-
              count.)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Id=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "ACCOUNT",
            "Id": "string"
          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of filtering results to display per page.

       --next-token (string)
          If a NextToken was returned by a previous  call,  more  results  are
          available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again
          using the returned token in NextToken .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       HomeRegionControls -> (list)
          An array that contains your HomeRegionControl objects.

          (structure)
              A  home  region control is an object that specifies the home re-
              gion for an account, with some additional information.  It  con-
              tains  a  target (always of type ACCOUNT ), an ID, and a time at
              which the home region was set.

              ControlId -> (string)
                 A unique identifier that's generated  for  each  home  region
                 control.  It's  always  a string that begins with "hrc-" fol-
                 lowed by 12 lowercase letters and numbers.

              HomeRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region that's been set as home region.  For  example,
                 "us-west-2" or "eu-central-1" are valid home regions.

              Target -> (structure)
                 The  target  parameter  specifies the identifier to which the
                 home region is applied, which is always an ACCOUNT .  It  ap-
                 plies the home region to the current ACCOUNT .

                 Type -> (string)
                     The target type is always an ACCOUNT .

                 Id -> (string)
                     The  TargetID is a 12-character identifier of the ACCOUNT
                     for which the control was created. (This must be the cur-
                     rent account.)

              RequestedTime -> (timestamp)
                 A  timestamp  representing  the time when the customer called
                 CreateHomeregionControl and set the home region for  the  ac-
                 count.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  a  NextToken  was  returned by a previous call, more results are
          available. To retrieve the next page of results, make the call again
          using the returned token in NextToken .
