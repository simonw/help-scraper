NAME
       describe-dataset-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  dataset import job created by  CreateDatasetImportJob ,
       including the import job status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-dataset-import-job
          --dataset-import-job-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-import-job-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  dataset  import  job  to  de-
          scribe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       datasetImportJob -> (structure)
          Information about the dataset import job, including the status.

          The status is one of the following values:

          o CREATE PENDING

          o CREATE IN_PROGRESS

          o ACTIVE

          o CREATE FAILED

          jobName -> (string)
              The name of the import job.

          datasetImportJobArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the dataset import job.

          datasetArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset that receives the
              imported data.

          dataSource -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the training data to import.

              dataLocation -> (string)
                 The path to the Amazon S3 bucket where the data that you want
                 to upload to your dataset is stored. For example:
                     s3://bucket-name/folder-name/

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN  of  the IAM role that has permissions to read from the
              Amazon S3 data source.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the dataset import job.

              A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:

              o CREATE PENDING >  CREATE  IN_PROGRESS  >  ACTIVE  -or-  CREATE
                FAILED

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The  creation date and time (in Unix time) of the dataset import
              job.

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix time) the dataset was last updated.

          failureReason -> (string)
              If a dataset import job fails, provides the reason why.
