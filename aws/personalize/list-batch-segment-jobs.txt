LIST-BATCH-SEGMENT-JOBS()                            LIST-BATCH-SEGMENT-JOBS()



NAME
       list-batch-segment-jobs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of the batch segment jobs that have been performed off of a
       solution version that you specify.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-batch-segment-jobs is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: batchSegmentJobs

SYNOPSIS
            list-batch-segment-jobs
          [--solution-version-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the solution version that the
          batch segment jobs used to generate batch segments.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       batchSegmentJobs -> (list)
          A list containing information on each job that is returned.

          (structure)
              A truncated version of the  BatchSegmentJob datatype. The  List-
              BatchSegmentJobs  operation  returns a list of batch segment job
              summaries.

              batchSegmentJobArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the batch segment job.

              jobName -> (string)
                 The name of the batch segment job.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the batch segment job. The status is one of the
                 following values:

                 o PENDING

                 o IN PROGRESS

                 o ACTIVE

                 o CREATE FAILED

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the batch segment job was created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the batch segment job was last updated.

              failureReason -> (string)
                 If the batch segment job failed, the reason for the failure.

              solutionVersionArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version used
                 by the batch segment job to generate batch segments.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. The value  is
          null when there are no more results to return.
