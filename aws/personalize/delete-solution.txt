       delete-solution -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  all versions of a solution and the Solution object itself. Be-
       fore deleting a solution, you must delete all campaigns  based  on  the
       solution.  To  determine  what  campaigns  are using the solution, call
       ListCampaigns and supply the Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  solu-
       tion.  You  can't delete a solution if an associated SolutionVersion is
       in the CREATE PENDING or IN PROGRESS state. For more information on so-
       lutions, see  CreateSolution .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-solution
          --solution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-arn (string)
          The ARN of the solution to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
