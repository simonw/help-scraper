CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()                        CREATE-DATASET-IMPORT-JOB()



NAME
       create-dataset-import-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a job that imports training data from your data source (an Ama-
       zon S3 bucket) to an Amazon Personalize dataset. To allow  Amazon  Per-
       sonalize  to  import the training data, you must specify an IAM service
       role that has permission to read from the data source, as  Amazon  Per-
       sonalize makes a copy of your data and processes it internally. For in-
       formation on granting access to your Amazon S3 bucket, see Giving  Ama-
       zon Personalize Access to Amazon S3 Resources .

       WARNING:
              The dataset import job replaces any existing data in the dataset
              that you imported in bulk.

          Status

       A dataset import job can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       To get the status of the import job, call   DescribeDatasetImportJob  ,
       providing the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the dataset import job. The
       dataset import is complete when the status shows as ACTIVE. If the sta-
       tus  shows as CREATE FAILED, the response includes a failureReason key,
       which describes why the job failed.

       NOTE:
              Importing takes time. You must wait until the  status  shows  as
              ACTIVE before training a model using the dataset.

SYNOPSIS
            create-dataset-import-job
          --job-name <value>
          --dataset-arn <value>
          --data-source <value>
          --role-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-name (string)
          The name for the dataset import job.

       --dataset-arn (string)
          The ARN of the dataset that receives the imported data.

       --data-source (structure)
          The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the training data to import.

          dataLocation -> (string)
              The path to the Amazon S3 bucket where the data that you want to
              upload to your dataset is stored. For example:
                 s3://bucket-name/folder-name/

       Shorthand Syntax:

          dataLocation=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "dataLocation": "string"
          }

       --role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM role that has permissions to read from the Amazon
          S3 data source.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       datasetImportJobArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the dataset import job.
