DESCRIBE-RECIPE()                                            DESCRIBE-RECIPE()



NAME
       describe-recipe -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a recipe.

       A recipe contains three items:

       o An algorithm that trains a model.

       o Hyperparameters that govern the training.

       o Feature  transformation  information for modifying the input data be-
         fore training.

       Amazon Personalize provides a set of predefined recipes. You specify  a
       recipe when you create a solution with the CreateSolution API. CreateS-
       olution trains a model by using the algorithm in the  specified  recipe
       and  a training dataset. The solution, when deployed as a campaign, can
       provide recommendations using the GetRecommendations API.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-recipe
          --recipe-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       recipe -> (structure)
          An object that describes the recipe.

          name -> (string)
              The name of the recipe.

          recipeArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe.

          algorithmArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the algorithm that Amazon Per-
              sonalize uses to train the model.

          featureTransformationArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the FeatureTransformation object.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the recipe.

          description -> (string)
              The description of the recipe.

          creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix format) that the recipe was created.

          recipeType -> (string)
              One of the following values:

              o PERSONALIZED_RANKING

              o RELATED_ITEMS

              o USER_PERSONALIZATION

          lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time (in Unix format) that the recipe was last  up-
