CREATE-SOLUTION()                                            CREATE-SOLUTION()



NAME
       create-solution -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  the  configuration  for  training  a model. A trained model is
       known as a solution. After the configuration is created, you train  the
       model  (create a solution) by calling the  CreateSolutionVersion opera-
       tion. Every time you call CreateSolutionVersion , a new version of  the
       solution is created.

       After  creating  a  solution version, you check its accuracy by calling
       GetSolutionMetrics . When you are satisfied with the version,  you  de-
       ploy  it  using  CreateCampaign . The campaign provides recommendations
       to a client through the GetRecommendations API.

       To train a model, Amazon  Personalize  requires  training  data  and  a
       recipe. The training data comes from the dataset group that you provide
       in the request. A recipe specifies the training algorithm and a feature
       transformation.  You can specify one of the predefined recipes provided
       by Amazon Personalize. Alternatively, you can specify performAutoML and
       Amazon  Personalize  will  analyze  your  data  and  select the optimum
       USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe for you.

       NOTE:
              Amazon Personalize doesn't support configuring the  hpoObjective
              for solution hyperparameter optimization at this time.

          Status

       A solution can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To  get the status of the solution, call  DescribeSolution . Wait until
       the status shows as ACTIVE before calling CreateSolutionVersion .

SYNOPSIS
            create-solution
          --name <value>
          [--perform-hpo | --no-perform-hpo]
          [--perform-auto-ml | --no-perform-auto-ml]
          [--recipe-arn <value>]
          --dataset-group-arn <value>
          [--event-type <value>]
          [--solution-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name for the solution.

       --perform-hpo | --no-perform-hpo (boolean)
          Whether to perform hyperparameter optimization (HPO) on  the  speci-
          fied or selected recipe. The default is false .

          When performing AutoML, this parameter is always true and you should
          not set it to false .

       --perform-auto-ml | --no-perform-auto-ml (boolean)
          Whether to perform automated machine learning (AutoML). The  default
          is false . For this case, you must specify recipeArn .

          When  set  to  true , Amazon Personalize analyzes your training data
          and selects the optimal USER_PERSONALIZATION recipe and hyperparame-
          ters. In this case, you must omit recipeArn . Amazon Personalize de-
          termines the optimal recipe by running tests with  different  values
          for  the  hyperparameters.  AutoML lengthens the training process as
          compared to selecting a specific recipe.

       --recipe-arn (string)
          The ARN of the recipe to use for model training. Only specified when
          performAutoML is false.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the dataset group that provides
          the training data.

       --event-type (string)
          When your have multiple event  types  (using  an  EVENT_TYPE  schema
          field),  this  parameter  specifies  which  event type (for example,
          'click' or 'like') is used for training the model.

          If you do not provide an eventType , Amazon Personalize will use all
          interactions for training with equal weight regardless of type.

       --solution-config (structure)
          The  configuration  to  use with the solution. When performAutoML is
          set to true, Amazon Personalize only evaluates the autoMLConfig sec-
          tion of the solution configuration.

          NOTE:
              Amazon  Personalize doesn't support configuring the hpoObjective
              at this time.

          eventValueThreshold -> (string)
              Only events with a value greater than or equal to this threshold
              are used for training a model.

          hpoConfig -> (structure)
              Describes the properties for hyperparameter optimization (HPO).

              hpoObjective -> (structure)
                 The metric to optimize during HPO.

                 NOTE:
                     Amazon Personalize doesn't support configuring the hpoOb-
                     jective at this time.

                 type -> (string)
                     The type of the metric. Valid  values  are  Maximize  and

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       solutionArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the solution.
