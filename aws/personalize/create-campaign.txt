CREATE-CAMPAIGN()                                            CREATE-CAMPAIGN()



NAME
       create-campaign -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a campaign that deploys a solution version. When a client calls
       the GetRecommendations and GetPersonalizedRanking APIs, a  campaign  is
       specified in the request.
          Minimum Provisioned TPS and Auto-Scaling

       A  transaction is a single GetRecommendations or GetPersonalizedRanking
       call. Transactions per second (TPS)  is  the  throughput  and  unit  of
       billing  for Amazon Personalize. The minimum provisioned TPS (minProvi-
       sionedTPS ) specifies the baseline  throughput  provisioned  by  Amazon
       Personalize, and thus, the minimum billing charge.

       If  your  TPS  increases  beyond minProvisionedTPS , Amazon Personalize
       auto-scales the provisioned capacity up and down, but never below  min-
       ProvisionedTPS  .  There's a short time delay while the capacity is in-
       creased that might cause loss of transactions.

       The actual TPS used is calculated as the average requests/second within
       a  5-minute  window.  You  pay for maximum of either the minimum provi-
       sioned TPS or the actual TPS. We recommend starting with a low  minPro-
       visionedTPS  ,  track  your  usage using Amazon CloudWatch metrics, and
       then increase the minProvisionedTPS as necessary.
          Status

       A campaign can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the campaign status, call  DescribeCampaign .

       NOTE:
              Wait until the status of the campaign is  ACTIVE  before  asking
              the campaign for recommendations.

SYNOPSIS
            create-campaign
          --name <value>
          --solution-version-arn <value>
          [--min-provisioned-tps <value>]
          [--campaign-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          A name for the new campaign. The campaign name must be unique within
          your account.

       --solution-version-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version to deploy.

       --min-provisioned-tps (integer)
          Specifies the requested minimum provisioned transactions  (recommen-
          dations) per second that Amazon Personalize will support.

       --campaign-config (structure)
          The configuration details of a campaign.

          itemExplorationConfig -> (map)
              Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, includ-
              ing explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff , you want to
              use to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personal-
              ize uses when recommending items. Provide  itemExplorationConfig
              data only if your solution uses the User-Personalization recipe.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          itemExplorationConfig={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "itemExplorationConfig": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       campaignArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the campaign.
