CREATE-RECOMMENDER()                                      CREATE-RECOMMENDER()



NAME
       create-recommender -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a recommender with the recipe (a Domain dataset group use case)
       you specify. You create recommenders for a  Domain  dataset  group  and
       specify  the  recommender's  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) when you make a
       GetRecommendations request.
          Minimum recommendation requests per second

       When you create a recommender, you can configure the recommender's min-
       imum recommendation requests per second. The minimum recommendation re-
       quests per second (minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond )  specifies  the
       baseline  recommendation  request throughput provisioned by Amazon Per-
       sonalize. The default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond is 1 . A  rec-
       ommendation  request  is a single GetRecommendations operation. Request
       throughput is measured in requests per second  and  Amazon  Personalize
       uses  your requests per second to derive your requests per hour and the
       price of your recommender usage.

       If your  requests  per  second  increases  beyond  minRecommendationRe-
       questsPerSecond , Amazon Personalize auto-scales the provisioned capac-
       ity up and down, but never below  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond  .
       There's  a  short time delay while the capacity is increased that might
       cause loss of requests.

       Your bill is the greater of either the minimum requests per hour (based
       on  minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond)  or  the  actual  number of re-
       quests. The actual request throughput used is calculated as the average
       requests/second  within  a  one-hour window. We recommend starting with
       the default minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond , track your usage using
       Amazon  CloudWatch  metrics, and then increase the minRecommendationRe-
       questsPerSecond as necessary.
          Status

       A recommender can be in one of the following states:

       o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS > ACTIVE -or- CREATE FAILED

       o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

       To get the recommender status, call  DescribeRecommender .

       NOTE:
              Wait until the status of the recommender is ACTIVE before asking
              the recommender for recommendations.

SYNOPSIS
            create-recommender
          --name <value>
          --dataset-group-arn <value>
          --recipe-arn <value>
          [--recommender-config <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the recommender.

       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the destination domain dataset
          group for the recommender.

       --recipe-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recipe  that  the  recommender
          will  use. For a recommender, a recipe is a Domain dataset group use
          case. Only Domain dataset group use cases can be used  to  create  a
          recommender.  For  information  about  use cases see Choosing recom-
          mender use cases .

       --recommender-config (structure)
          The configuration details of the recommender.

          itemExplorationConfig -> (map)
              Specifies the exploration configuration hyperparameters, includ-
              ing explorationWeight and explorationItemAgeCutOff , you want to
              use to configure the amount of item exploration Amazon Personal-
              ize  uses when recommending items. Provide itemExplorationConfig
              data only if your recommenders generate personalized recommenda-
              tions for a user (not popular items or similar items).

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  requested minimum provisioned recommendation re-
              quests per second that Amazon Personalize will support.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          itemExplorationConfig={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "itemExplorationConfig": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "minRecommendationRequestsPerSecond": integer
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       recommenderArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the recommender.
