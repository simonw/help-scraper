LIST-EVENT-TRACKERS()                                    LIST-EVENT-TRACKERS()



NAME
       list-event-trackers -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the list of event trackers associated with the account. The re-
       sponse provides the properties for each event  tracker,  including  the
       Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  and tracking ID. For more information on
       event trackers, see CreateEventTracker .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-event-trackers is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: eventTrackers

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-trackers
          [--dataset-group-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --dataset-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of a dataset group used to filter the response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       eventTrackers -> (list)
          A list of event trackers.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the properties of an event tracker. For a
              complete listing, call the DescribeEventTracker API.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the event tracker.

              eventTrackerArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event tracker.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the event tracker.

                 An event tracker can be in one of the following states:

                 o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS >  ACTIVE  -or-  CREATE
                   FAILED

                 o DELETE PENDING > DELETE IN_PROGRESS

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and time (in Unix time) that the event tracker was
                 created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time (in Unix time) that the event  tracker  was
                 last updated.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token for getting the next set of event trackers (if they exist).
