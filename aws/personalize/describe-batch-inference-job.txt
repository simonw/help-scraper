NAME
       describe-batch-inference-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the properties of a batch inference job including name, Amazon Re-
       source Name (ARN), status, input and output configurations, and the ARN
       of the solution version used to generate the recommendations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-batch-inference-job
          --batch-inference-job-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --batch-inference-job-arn (string)
          The ARN of the batch inference job to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                     vice (KMS) key that Amazon Personalize uses to encrypt or

                     job.

          jobOutput -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the output data generated  by

              s3DataDestination -> (structure)
                 Information on the Amazon S3 bucket in which the batch infer-
                 ence job's output is stored.

                 path -> (string)
                     The file path of the Amazon S3 bucket.

                     vice (KMS) key that Amazon Personalize uses to encrypt or
                     decrypt the input and output files of a  batch  inference
                     job.

          batchInferenceJobConfig -> (structure)
              A  string  to string map of the configuration details of a batch
              inference job.

                 A string to string map specifying the exploration  configura-
                 tion  hyperparameters, including explorationWeight and explo-
                 rationItemAgeCutOff , you want to use to configure the amount
                 of item exploration Amazon Personalize uses when recommending
                 items. See User-Personalization .
