LIST-SOLUTION-VERSIONS()                              LIST-SOLUTION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-solution-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of solution versions for the given solution. When a so-
       lution is not specified, all the solution versions associated with  the
       account are listed. The response provides the properties for each solu-
       tion version, including the Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more infor-
       mation on solutions, see  CreateSolution .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-solution-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: solutionVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-solution-versions
          [--solution-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --solution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       solutionVersions -> (list)
          A list of solution versions describing the version properties.

          (structure)
              Provides  a summary of the properties of a solution version. For
              a complete listing, call the  DescribeSolutionVersion API.

              solutionVersionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the solution version.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the solution version.

                 A solution version can be in one of the following states:

                 o CREATE PENDING > CREATE IN_PROGRESS >  ACTIVE  -or-  CREATE
                   FAILED

              creationDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time (in Unix time) that this version of a solu-
                 tion was created.

              lastUpdatedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time (in Unix time) that  the  solution  version
                 was last updated.

              failureReason -> (string)
                 If a solution version fails, the reason behind the failure.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  token  for getting the next set of solution versions (if they ex-
          ist).
