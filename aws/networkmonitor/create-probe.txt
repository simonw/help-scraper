CREATE-PROBE()                                                  CREATE-PROBE()



NAME
       create-probe -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a probe within a monitor. Once you create a probe, and it begins
       monitoring your network traffic, you'll incur billing charges for  that
       probe. This action requires the monitorName parameter. Run ListMonitors
       to get a list of monitor names. Note the name of  the  monitorName  you
       want to create the probe for.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          sourceArn=string,destination=string,destinationPort=integer,protocol=string,packetSize=integer,tags={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "sourceArn": "string",
            "destination": "string",
            "destinationPort": integer,
            "protocol": "TCP"|"ICMP",
            "packetSize": integer,
            "tags": {"string": "string"
              ...}
          }

       --client-token (string)
          Unique,  case-sensitive  identifier to ensure the idempotency of the
          request. Only returned if a client token was  provided  in  the  re-
          quest.

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a probe that uses TCP and add it to a network mon-
       itor

       The  following  create-probe  example creates a probe that uses the TCP
       protocol and adds the probe to a monitor named  Example_NetworkMonitor.
       Once  created,  the state of the monitor with the probe will be PENDING
       until the monitor is ACTIVE. This might take several minutes, at  which
       point the state will change to ACTIVE, and you can start viewing Cloud-
       Watch metrics.

          aws networkmonitor create-probe \
              --monitor-name Example_NetworkMonitor \
              --probe sourceArn=arn:aws:ec2:region:111122223333:subnet/subnet-id,destination=10.0.0.100,destinationPort=80,protocol=TCP,packetSize=56,tags={Name=Probe1}

       Output:

          {
              "probeId": "probe-12345",
              "probeArn": "arn:aws:networkmonitor:region:111122223333:probe/probe-12345",
              "destination": "10.0.0.100",
              "destinationPort": 80,
              "packetSize": 56,
              "addressFamily": "IPV4",
              "vpcId": "vpc-12345",
              "state": "PENDING",
              "createdAt": "2024-03-29T12:41:57.314000-04:00",
              "modifiedAt": "2024-03-29T12:41:57.314000-04:00",
              "tags": {
                  "Name": "Probe1"
              }
          }

       Example 2: To create a probe that uses probe using ICMP and add it to a
       network monitor

       The  following  create-probe example creates a probe that uses the ICMP
       protocol and adds the probe to a monitor named  Example_NetworkMonitor.
       Once  created,  the state of the monitor with the probe will be PENDING
       until the monitor is ACTIVE. This might take several minutes, at  which
       point the state will change to ACTIVE, and you can start viewing Cloud-
       Watch metrics.

          aws networkmonitor create-probe \
              --monitor-name Example_NetworkMonitor \
              --probe sourceArn=arn:aws:ec2:region:012345678910:subnet/subnet-id,destination=10.0.0.100,protocol=ICMP,packetSize=56,tags={Name=Probe1}

       Output:

          {
              "probeId": "probe-12345",
              "probeArn": "arn:aws:networkmonitor:region:111122223333:probe/probe-12345",
              "destination": "10.0.0.100",
              "packetSize": 56,
              "addressFamily": "IPV4",
              "vpcId": "vpc-12345",
              "state": "PENDING",
              "createdAt": "2024-03-29T12:44:02.452000-04:00",
              "modifiedAt": "2024-03-29T12:44:02.452000-04:00",
              "tags": {
                  "Name": "Probe1"
              }
          }
