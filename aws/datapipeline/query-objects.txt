QUERY-OBJECTS()                                                QUERY-OBJECTS()



NAME
       query-objects -

DESCRIPTION
       Queries  the specified pipeline for the names of objects that match the
       specified set of conditions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       query-objects is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ids

SYNOPSIS
            query-objects
          --pipeline-id <value>
          --sphere <value>
          [--objects-query <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline.

       --sphere (string)
          Indicates  whether the query applies to components or instances. The
          possible values are: COMPONENT , INSTANCE , and ATTEMPT .

       --objects-query (structure)
          The query that defines the objects to be returned. The Query  object
          can  contain a maximum of ten selectors. The conditions in the query
          are limited to top-level String fields in the object. These  filters
          can be applied to components, instances, and attempts.

          selectors -> (list)
              List  of selectors that define the query. An object must satisfy
              all of the selectors to match the query.

              (structure)
                 A comparision that is  used  to  determine  whether  a  query
                 should return this object.

                 fieldName -> (string)
                     The  name  of the field that the operator will be applied
                     to. The field name is the "key" portion of the field def-
                     inition in the pipeline definition syntax that is used by
                     the AWS Data Pipeline API. If the field is not set on the
                     object, the condition fails.

                 operator -> (structure)
                     Contains a logical operation for comparing the value of a
                     field with a specified value.

                     type -> (string)
                        The logical operation to be performed:  equal  (EQ  ),
                        equal  reference  (REF_EQ ), less than or equal (LE ),
                        greater than or equal (GE ), or  between  (BETWEEN  ).
                        Equal reference (REF_EQ ) can be used only with refer-
                        ence fields. The other comparison types  can  be  used
                        only  with String fields. The comparison types you can
                        use apply only to certain object fields,  as  detailed
                        below.

                        The comparison operators EQ and REF_EQ act on the fol-
                        lowing fields:

                        o name

                        o @sphere

                        o parent

                        o @componentParent

                        o @instanceParent

                        o @status

                        o @scheduledStartTime

                        o @scheduledEndTime

                        o @actualStartTime

                        o @actualEndTime

                        The comparison operators GE , LE , and BETWEEN act  on
                        the following fields:

                        o @scheduledStartTime

                        o @scheduledEndTime

                        o @actualStartTime

                        o @actualEndTime

                        Note  that  fields  beginning with the at sign (@) are
                        read-only and set by the web service.  When  you  name
                        fields,  you  should  choose names containing only al-
                        pha-numeric values, as symbols may be reserved by  AWS
                        Data  Pipeline.  User-defined fields that you add to a
                        pipeline should prefix  their  name  with  the  string
                        "my".

                     values -> (list)
                        The value that the actual field value will be compared
                        with.

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "selectors": [
              {
                "fieldName": "string",
                "operator": {
                  "type": "EQ"|"REF_EQ"|"LE"|"GE"|"BETWEEN",
                  "values": ["string", ...]
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ids -> (list)
          The identifiers that match the query selectors.

          (string)

       marker -> (string)
          The starting point for the next page of results. To  view  the  next
          page  of results, call QueryObjects again with this marker value. If
          the value is null, there are no more results.

       hasMoreResults -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more results that can be obtained  by  a
          subsequent call.
