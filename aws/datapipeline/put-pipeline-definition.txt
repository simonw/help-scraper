PUT-PIPELINE-DEFINITION()                            PUT-PIPELINE-DEFINITION()



NAME
       put-pipeline-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds tasks, schedules, and preconditions to the specified pipeline. You
       can use PutPipelineDefinition to populate a new pipeline.
          PutPipelineDefinition also validates the configuration as it adds it
          to the pipeline. Changes to the pipeline are saved unless one of the
          following three validation errors exists in the pipeline.

       o An object is missing a name or identifier field.

       o A string or reference field is empty.

       o The number of objects in the pipeline exceeds the maximum allowed ob-
         jects.

       o The pipeline is in a FINISHED state.

       Pipeline object definitions are passed to the PutPipelineDefinition ac-
       tion and returned by the  GetPipelineDefinition action.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-pipeline-definition
          --pipeline-id <value>
          [--parameter-objects <value>]
          [--parameter-values <value>]
          --pipeline-definition <value>
          [--parameter-values-uri <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline.

       --parameter-objects (string) The JSON parameter objects. If the parame-
       ter  objects  are  in a file you can use the file://syntax to specify a
       filename. You can optionally provide these in  pipeline  definition  as
       well.  Parameter objects provided on command line would replace the one
       in definition.

       --parameter-values (string) The JSON parameter values. You can  specify
       these  as  key-value pairs in the key=value format. Multiple parameters
       are separated by a space. For list type parameter values  you  can  use
       the  same key name and specify each value as a key value pair. e.g. ar-
       rayValue=value1 arrayValue=value2

       --pipeline-definition (string) The JSON  pipeline  definition.  If  the
       pipeline definition is in a file you can use the file://syntax to spec-
       ify a filename.

       --parameter-values-uri (string) The JSON parameter values. If  the  pa-
       rameter values are in a file you can use the file://syntax to specify a
       filename. You can optionally provide these in  pipeline  definition  as
       well.  Parameter  values provided on command line would replace the one
       in definition.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To upload a pipeline definition

       This example uploads the specified pipeline definition to the specified
       pipeline:

          aws datapipeline put-pipeline-definition --pipeline-id df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE --pipeline-definition file://my-pipeline-definition.json

       The following is example output:

          {
            "validationErrors": [],
            "errored": false,
            "validationWarnings": []
          }

OUTPUT
       validationErrors -> (list)
          The validation errors that are associated with the  objects  defined
          in pipelineObjects .

          (structure)
              Defines  a  validation error. Validation errors prevent pipeline
              activation. The set of validation errors that  can  be  returned
              are defined by AWS Data Pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the object that contains the validation er-
                 ror.

              errors -> (list)
                 A description of the validation error.

                 (string)

       validationWarnings -> (list)
          The validation warnings that are associated with the objects defined
          in pipelineObjects .

          (structure)
              Defines a validation warning. Validation warnings do not prevent
              pipeline activation. The set of validation warnings that can  be
              returned are defined by AWS Data Pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  object that contains the validation
                 warning.

              warnings -> (list)
                 A description of the validation warning.

                 (string)

       errored -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there were validation  errors,  and  the  pipeline
          definition  is  stored but cannot be activated until you correct the
          pipeline and call  PutPipelineDefinition  to  commit  the  corrected
          pipeline.
