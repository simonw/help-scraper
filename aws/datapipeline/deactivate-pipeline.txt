DEACTIVATE-PIPELINE()                                    DEACTIVATE-PIPELINE()



NAME
       deactivate-pipeline -

DESCRIPTION
       Deactivates  the specified running pipeline. The pipeline is set to the
       DEACTIVATING state until the deactivation process completes.

       To resume a deactivated pipeline, use  ActivatePipeline .  By  default,
       the pipeline resumes from the last completed execution. Optionally, you
       can specify the date and time to resume the pipeline.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            deactivate-pipeline
          --pipeline-id <value>
          [--cancel-active | --no-cancel-active]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The ID of the pipeline.

       --cancel-active | --no-cancel-active (boolean)
          Indicates whether to cancel any  running  objects.  The  default  is
          true,  which  sets the state of any running objects to CANCELED . If
          this value is false, the pipeline is deactivated after  all  running
          objects finish.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To deactivate a pipeline

       This example deactivates the specified pipeline:

          aws datapipeline deactivate-pipeline --pipeline-id df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE

       To deactivate the pipeline only after all  running  activities  finish,
       use the following command:

          aws datapipeline deactivate-pipeline --pipeline-id df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE --no-cancel-active

OUTPUT
       None
