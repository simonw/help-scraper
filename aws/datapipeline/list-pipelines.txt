LIST-PIPELINES()                                              LIST-PIPELINES()



NAME
       list-pipelines -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  pipeline identifiers for all active pipelines that you have
       permission to access.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-pipelines is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: pipelineIdList

SYNOPSIS
            list-pipelines
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list your pipelines

       This example lists your pipelines:

          aws datapipeline list-pipelines

       The following is example output:

          {
            "pipelineIdList": [
                {
                    "id": "df-00627471SOVYZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "my-pipeline"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-09028963KNVMREXAMPLE",
                    "name": "ImportDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-0870198233ZYVEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CrossRegionDDB"
                },
                {
                    "id": "df-00189603TB4MZEXAMPLE",
                    "name": "CopyRedshift"
                }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       pipelineIdList -> (list)
          The  pipeline  identifiers.  If  you  require additional information
          about the pipelines, you can use  these  identifiers  to  call   De-
          scribePipelines and  GetPipelineDefinition .

          (structure)
              Contains the name and identifier of a pipeline.

              id -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the pipeline that was assigned by AWS Data Pipe-
                 line. This is a string of the form df-297EG78HU43EEXAMPLE .

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the pipeline.

       marker -> (string)
          The starting point for the next page of results. To  view  the  next
          page  of  results,  call  ListPipelinesOutput again with this marker
          value. If the value is null, there are no more results.

       hasMoreResults -> (boolean)
          Indicates whether there are more results that can be obtained  by  a
          subsequent call.
