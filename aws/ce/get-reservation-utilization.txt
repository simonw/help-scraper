GET-RESERVATION-UTILIZATION()                    GET-RESERVATION-UTILIZATION()



NAME
       get-reservation-utilization -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the reservation utilization for your account. Management ac-
       count in an organization have access to member accounts. You can filter
       data  by dimensions in a time period. You can use GetDimensionValues to
       determine the possible dimension values. Currently, you can group  only
       by SUBSCRIPTION_ID .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-reservation-utilization
          --time-period <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          Sets  the  start  and  end  dates for retrieving RI utilization. The
          start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example,
          if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the cost and us-
          age data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30
          but not including 2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --group-by (list)
          Groups only by SUBSCRIPTION_ID . Metadata is included.

          (structure)
              Represents a group when you specify a group by  criteria  or  in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --granularity (string)
          If  GroupBy  is  set, Granularity can't be set. If Granularity isn't
          set, the  response  object  doesn't  include  Granularity  ,  either
          MONTHLY  or  DAILY . If both GroupBy and Granularity aren't set, Ge-
          tReservationUtilization defaults to DAILY .

          The GetReservationUtilization  operation  supports  only  DAILY  and
          MONTHLY granularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters  utilization  data by dimensions. You can filter by the fol-
          lowing dimensions:

          o AZ

          o CACHE_ENGINE

          o DEPLOYMENT_OPTION

          o INSTANCE_TYPE

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o OPERATING_SYSTEM

          o PLATFORM

          o REGION

          o SERVICE

          o SCOPE

          o TENANCY
              GetReservationUtilization uses the same Expression object as the
              other  operations,  but  only AND is supported among each dimen-
              sion, and nesting is supported up to only  one  level  deep.  If
              there  are  multiple  values  for a dimension, they are OR'd to-
              gether.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to
                        find specific values.

                        lated  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values   for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

          to get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the reservation utilization for your account

       The following get-reservation-utilization example retrieves the RI uti-
       lization  for  all t2.nano instance types from 2018-03-01 to 2018-08-01
       for the account.

          aws ce get-reservation-utilization \
              --time-period Start=2018-03-01,End=2018-08-01 \
              --filter file://filters.json

       Contents of filters.json:

          {
              "Dimensions": {
                  "Key": "INSTANCE_TYPE",
                  "Values": [
                      "t2.nano"
                  ]
              }
          }

       Output:

          {
              "Total": {
                  "TotalAmortizedFee": "0",
                  "UtilizationPercentage": "0",

              },
              "UtilizationsByTime": []
          }

OUTPUT
       UtilizationsByTime -> (list)
          The amount of time that you used your RIs.

          (structure)
              The amount of utilization, in hours.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The period of time that this utilization was used for.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  in-
                     clusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web
                     Services  retrieves  cost  and  usage  data  starting  at
                     2017-01-01  up  to  the  end date. The start date must be
                     equal to or no later than the current  date  to  avoid  a
                     validation error.

                 End -> (string)
                     The  end  of  the time period. The end date is exclusive.
                     For example, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon  Web  Services
                     retrieves  cost and usage data from the start date up to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .

              Groups -> (list)
