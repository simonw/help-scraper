NAME
       update-cost-category-definition -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  an  existing  Cost Category. Changes made to the Cost Category
       rules will be used to categorize the current months expenses and future
       expenses. This wont change categorization for the previous months.

SYNOPSIS
            update-cost-category-definition
          --cost-category-arn <value>
          --rule-version <value>
          --rules <value>
          [--default-value <value>]
          [--split-charge-rules <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cost-category-arn (string)
          The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

       --rule-version (string)
          The rule schema version in this particular Cost Category.

          Possible values:

          o CostCategoryExpression.v1

       --rules (list)
          The  Expression  object  used to categorize costs. For more informa-
          tion, see CostCategoryRule .

          (structure)
              Rules are processed in order. If there are multiple  rules  that
              match the line item, then the first rule to match is used to de-
              termine that Cost Category value.

              Value -> (string)
                 The default value for the cost category.

              Rule -> (structure)
                 An Expression object used to categorize costs. This  supports
                 dimensions,  tags, and nested expressions. Currently the only
                 dimensions supported  are  LINKED_ACCOUNT  ,  SERVICE_CODE  ,
                 RECORD_TYPE , and LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME .

                 Root level OR isn't supported. We recommend that you create a
                 separate rule instead.
                     RECORD_TYPE is a dimension used for Cost  Explorer  APIs,
                     and is also supported for Cost Category expressions. This
                     dimension uses  different  terms,  depending  on  whether
                     you're  using  the  console or API/JSON editor. For a de-
                     tailed comparison, see Term Comparisons  in  the  Billing
                     and Cost Management User Guide .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     (structure)
                        Use  Expression  to  filter by cost or by usage. There
                        are two patterns:

                        o Simple dimension values - You can set the  dimension
                          name  and  values  for  the filters that you plan to
                          use.  For  example,   you   can   filter   for   RE-
                          GION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRight-
                          sizingRecommendation , the Region  is  a  full  name
                          (for  example,  REGION==US  East (N. Virginia) . The
                          Expression example is as follows:  { "Dimensions": {
                          "Key":  "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", us-west-1
                          ] } }   The list of dimension values  are  OR'd  to-
                          gether  to retrieve cost or usage data. You can cre-
                          ate Expression and DimensionValues objects using ei-
                          ther  with*  methods  or  set*  methods  in multiple
                          lines.

                        o Compound dimension values with logical operations  -
                          You  can use multiple Expression types and the logi-
                          cal operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or
                          more Expression objects. By doing this, you can fil-
                          ter on more advanced options. For example,  you  can
                          filter   on  ((REGION  ==  us-east-1  OR  REGION  ==
                          us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1))  AND  (USAGE_TYPE
                          !=  DataTransfer)  .  The  Expression for that is as
                          follows:  {  "And":  [  {"Or":  [  {"Dimensions":  {
                          "Key":    "REGION",    "Values":    [   "us-east-1",
                          "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Val-
                          ues":  ["Value1"]  }  } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimensions": {
                          "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"]  }}}
                          ] }

                        NOTE:
                               Because each Expression can have only one oper-
                               ator, the service returns an error if more than
                               one  is  specified. The following example shows
                               an Expression object that creates an error.

                            { "And": [ ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimen-
                            sion":  "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ]
                            } }

                        NOTE:
                            For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation  action,  a
                            combination  of  OR  and  NOT  isn't supported. OR
                            isn't supported between different  dimensions,  or
                            dimensions  and  tags.  NOT  operators aren't sup-
                            ported. Dimensions are also limited to  LINKED_AC-
                            COUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                            For  the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation ac-
                            tion, only NOT is supported.  AND  and  OR  aren't
                            supported.  Dimensions  are  limited to LINKED_AC-
                            COUNT .

                        Or -> (list)
                            Return results that match either Dimension object.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        And -> (list)
                            Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                        ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                            The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The names of the metadata types  that  you  can
                               use to filter and group your results. For exam-
                               ple, AZ returns a list of Availability Zones.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The metadata values that you can use to  filter
                               and  group  your results. You can use GetDimen-
                               sionValues to find specific values.

                               for actions related to Cost Category.  The  de-
                               fault  values  for  MatchOptions are EQUALS and
                               CASE_SENSITIVE .

                          (for example, REGION==US East (N.  Virginia)  .  The
                          Expression example is as follows:  { "Dimensions": {
                          "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",  us-west-1

                     If you specify LINKED_ACCOUNT_NAME ,  the  cost  category
                     value  is based on account name. If you specify TAG , the
                     cost category value will be based on  the  value  of  the
                     specified tag key.

                     The key to extract cost category values.

              Type -> (string)
                 You can define the CostCategoryRule rule type as either REGU-
                 LAR or INHERITED_VALUE . The INHERITED_VALUE rule  type  adds
                 the  flexibility of defining a rule that dynamically inherits
                 the cost category value from the dimension value  defined  by
                 CostCategoryInheritedValueDimension  .  For  example,  if you
                 want to dynamically group costs based on the value of a  spe-
                 cific  tag  key,  first  choose an inherited value rule type,
                 then choose the tag dimension and specify the tag key to use.

       --default-value (string)
          The default value for the cost category.

       --split-charge-rules (list)
          The split charge rules used to allocate your  charges  between  your
          Cost Category values.

          (structure)
              Use the split charge rule to split the cost of one Cost Category
              value across several other target values.

              Source -> (string)
                 The Cost Category value that you want to  split.  That  value
                 can't  be  used as a source or a target in other split charge
                 rules. To indicate uncategorized costs, you can use an  empty
                 string as the source.

              Targets -> (list)
                 The Cost Category values that you want to split costs across.
                 These values can't be used as a source in other split  charge
                 rules.

                 (string)

              Method -> (string)
                 The  method  that's  used  to define how to split your source
                 costs across your targets.
                     Proportional -  Allocates  charges  across  your  targets
                     based on the proportional weighted cost of each target.

                     Fixed  -  Allocates  charges across your targets based on
                     your defined allocation percentage.

                 >``Even`` - Allocates costs evenly across all targets.

              Parameters -> (list)
                 The parameters for a split charge method. This  is  only  re-
                 quired for the FIXED method.

                 (structure)
                     The parameters for a split charge method.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The parameter type.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The parameter values.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CostCategoryArn -> (string)
          The unique identifier for your Cost Category.

       EffectiveStart -> (string)
          The Cost Category's effective start date.
