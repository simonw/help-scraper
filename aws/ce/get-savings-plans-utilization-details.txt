GET-SAVINGS-PLANS-UTILIZATION-DETAILS()GET-SAVINGS-PLANS-UTILIZATION-DETAILS()



NAME
       get-savings-plans-utilization-details -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  attribute  data along with aggregate utilization and savings
       data for a given time period. This doesn't support granular or  grouped
       data (daily/monthly) in response. You can't retrieve data by dates in a
       single response similar to GetSavingsPlanUtilization , but you have the
       option  to  make  multiple calls to GetSavingsPlanUtilizationDetails by
       providing individual dates. You  can  use  GetDimensionValues  in  SAV-
       INGS_PLANS to determine the possible dimension values.

       NOTE:
          GetSavingsPlanUtilizationDetails  internally groups data by Savings-
          PlansArn .

SYNOPSIS
            get-savings-plans-utilization-details
          --time-period <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--data-type <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The time period that you want the usage and  costs  for.  The  Start
          date  must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the Start
          date, and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as  an
          End date.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --filter (structure)
          Filters Savings Plans utilization coverage data for  active  Savings
          Plans dimensions. You can filter data with the following dimensions:

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o SAVINGS_PLAN_ARN

          o REGION

          o PAYMENT_OPTION

          o INSTANCE_TYPE_FAMILY
              GetSavingsPlansUtilizationDetails  uses  the same Expression ob-
              ject as the other operations, but only AND  is  supported  among
              each dimension.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .
