SYNOPSIS
            get-usage-forecast
          --time-period <value>
          --metric <value>
          --granularity <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          [--prediction-interval-level <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The  start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve us-
          age forecast for. The start date is inclusive, but the end  date  is
          exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01
          , then the cost and usage data is retrieved from  2017-01-01  up  to
          and  including  2017-04-30  but not including 2017-05-01 . The start
          date must be equal to or later than the current date to avoid a val-
          idation error.

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --metric (string)
          Which metric Cost Explorer uses to create your forecast.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

       --prediction-interval-level (integer)
          Cost  Explorer  always  returns the mean forecast as a single point.
          You can request a prediction interval around the mean by  specifying
          a confidence level. The higher the confidence level, the more confi-
          dent Cost Explorer is about the actual value falling in the  predic-
          tion  interval.  Higher confidence levels result in wider prediction
          intervals.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Total -> (structure)
          How much you're forecasted to use over the forecast period.

          Amount -> (string)
              The actual number that represents the metric.

          Unit -> (string)
              The unit that the metric is given in.

       ForecastResultsByTime -> (list)
          The forecasts for your query, in order. For DAILY forecasts, this is
          a list of days. For MONTHLY forecasts, this is a list of months.

          (structure)
              The forecast that's created for your query.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The period of time that the forecast covers.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  in-
                     clusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web
                     Services  retrieves  cost  and  usage  data  starting  at
                     2017-01-01  up  to  the  end date. The start date must be
                     equal to or no later than the current  date  to  avoid  a
                     validation error.

                 End -> (string)
                     The  end  of  the time period. The end date is exclusive.
                     For example, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon  Web  Services
                     retrieves  cost and usage data from the start date up to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .

              MeanValue -> (string)
                 The mean value of the forecast.

              PredictionIntervalLowerBound -> (string)
                 The lower limit for the prediction interval.

              PredictionIntervalUpperBound -> (string)
                 The upper limit for the prediction interval.
