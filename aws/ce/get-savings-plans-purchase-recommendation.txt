OPTIONS
       --savings-plans-type (string)
          The Savings Plans recommendation type requested.

          Possible values:

          o EC2_INSTANCE_SP

          o SAGEMAKER_SP

       --term-in-years (string)
          The savings plan recommendation term used to generate  these  recom-
          mendations.

          Possible values:

          o ONE_YEAR

          o THREE_YEARS

       --payment-option (string)
          The payment option used to generate these recommendations.

          o MEDIUM_UTILIZATION

          o HEAVY_UTILIZATION

       --account-scope (string)
          The account scope that you want your recommendations for. Amazon Web
          Services calculates recommendations including the management account
          and  member  accounts if the value is set to PAYER . If the value is
          LINKED , recommendations are calculated for  individual  member  ac-
          counts only.

          o PAYER

          o LINKED

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --page-size (integer)
          The number of recommendations that you want returned in a single re-
          sponse object.

       --lookback-period-in-days (string)
          The lookback period used to generate the recommendation.

          Possible values:

          o SEVEN_DAYS

          o THIRTY_DAYS

          o SIXTY_DAYS

       --filter (structure)
          You  can  filter  your  recommendations  by  Account  ID  with   the
          LINKED_ACCOUNT  dimension. To filter your recommendations by Account
          ID, specify Key as LINKED_ACCOUNT and Value as  the  comma-separated
          Acount ID(s) for which you want to see Savings Plans purchase recom-
          mendations.

          For GetSavingsPlansPurchaseRecommendation, the Filter does  not  in-
          clude  CostCategories  or  Tags . It only includes Dimensions . With
          Dimensions , Key must be LINKED_ACCOUNT and Value can  be  a  single
          Account  ID  or  multiple  comma-separated Account IDs for which you
          want to see Savings Plans Purchase Recommendations. AND and OR oper-
          ators are not supported.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
