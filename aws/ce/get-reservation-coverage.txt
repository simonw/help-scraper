NAME
       get-reservation-coverage -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  reservation coverage for your account. This enables you
       to see how much of your Amazon Elastic Compute  Cloud,  Amazon  Elasti-
       Cache,  Amazon Relational Database Service, or Amazon Redshift usage is
       covered by a reservation. An organization's management account can  see
       the  coverage  of  the associated member accounts. This supports dimen-
       sions, Cost Categories, and nested expressions. For  any  time  period,
       you  can  filter  data  about reservation usage by the following dimen-
       sions:

       o AZ

       o CACHE_ENGINE

       o DATABASE_ENGINE

       o DEPLOYMENT_OPTION

       o INSTANCE_TYPE

       o LINKED_ACCOUNT

       o OPERATING_SYSTEM

       o PLATFORM

       o REGION

       o SERVICE

       o TAG

       o TENANCY

       To determine valid values for a dimension, use  the  GetDimensionValues
       operation.

SYNOPSIS
            get-reservation-coverage
          --time-period <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--metrics <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The start and end dates of the period that you want to retrieve data
          about reservation coverage for. You can retrieve data for a  maximum
          of  13  months:  the last 12 months and the current month. The start
          date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive.  For  example,  if
          start  is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the cost and usage
          data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30 but
          not including 2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is inclusive.
              For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon  Web  Services  re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date. The start date must be equal to or no later than the  cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services  retrieves  cost
              and  usage  data  from  the start date up to, but not including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --group-by (list)
          You can group the data by the following attributes:

          o AZ

          o CACHE_ENGINE

          o DATABASE_ENGINE

          o DEPLOYMENT_OPTION

          o INSTANCE_TYPE

          o INVOICING_ENTITY

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o OPERATING_SYSTEM

          o PLATFORM

          o REGION

          o TENANCY

          (structure)
              Represents a group when you specify a group by  criteria  or  in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --granularity (string)
          The  granularity of the Amazon Web Services cost data for the reser-
          vation. Valid values are MONTHLY and DAILY .

          If GroupBy is set, Granularity can't be set.  If  Granularity  isn't
          set,  the  response  object  doesn't  include  Granularity  , either
          MONTHLY or DAILY .

          The GetReservationCoverage operation supports only DAILY and MONTHLY
          granularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters  utilization  data by dimensions. You can filter by the fol-
          lowing dimensions:

          o AZ

          o CACHE_ENGINE

          o DATABASE_ENGINE

          o DEPLOYMENT_OPTION

          o INSTANCE_TYPE

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o OPERATING_SYSTEM

          o PLATFORM

          o REGION

          o SERVICE

          o TAG

          o TENANCY
              GetReservationCoverage uses the same Expression  object  as  the
              other  operations,  but  only AND is supported among each dimen-
              sion. You can nest only one level deep. If  there  are  multiple
              values for a dimension, they are OR'd together.

          If  you  don't  provide  a SERVICE filter, Cost Explorer defaults to
          EC2.

          Cost category is also supported.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The match options that you can use to filter your  re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated  to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values   for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                        (string)

                 Tags -> (structure)

                     Values -> (list)
                        The specific value of the tag.

          }

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of objects that you returned for this request. If
          more objects are available, in the  response,  Amazon  Web  Services
          provides a NextPageToken value that you can use in a subsequent call
          to get the next batch of objects.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CoveragesByTime -> (list)
          The amount of time that your reservations covered.

          (structure)
              Reservation coverage for a specified period, in hours.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The period that this coverage was used over.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The  beginning  of the time period. The start date is in-
                     clusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web
                     Services  retrieves  cost  and  usage  data  starting  at
                     2017-01-01 up to the end date. The  start  date  must  be
                     equal  to  or  no  later than the current date to avoid a
                     validation error.

                 End -> (string)
                     The end of the time period. The end  date  is  exclusive.
                     For  example,  if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services
                     retrieves cost and usage data from the start date up  to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .
