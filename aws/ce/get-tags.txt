SYNOPSIS
            get-tags
          [--search-string <value>]
          --time-period <value>
          [--tag-key <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --search-string (string)
          The value that you want to search for.

       --time-period (structure)
          The start and end dates for retrieving  the  dimension  values.  The
          start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive. For example,
          if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the cost and us-
          age data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including 2017-04-30
          but not including 2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web Services re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --tag-key (string)
          The key of the tag that you want to return values for.

       --filter (structure)
          Use  Expression  to  filter  by cost or by usage. There are two pat-
          terns:

          o Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and  val-
            ues  for  the  filters  that you plan to use. For example, you can
            filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For  GetRight-
            sizingRecommendation , the Region is a full name (for example, RE-
            GION==US East (N. Virginia) . The Expression example  is  as  fol-
            lows:  { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
            us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are  OR'd  together
            to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Expression and Di-
            mensionValues objects using either with* methods or  set*  methods
            in multiple lines.

          o Compound  dimension  values  with logical operations - You can use
            multiple Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT  to
            create  a  list  of one or more Expression objects. By doing this,
            you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can fil-
            ter  on ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
            == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The  Expression  for
            that  is  as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
            "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},  {"Tags":  {
            "Key":  "TagName",  "Values":  ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimen-
            sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
                 Because each Expression can have only one operator, the  ser-
                 vice returns an error if more than one is specified. The fol-
                 lowing example shows an Expression object that creates an er-
                 ror.

              {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":  "US-
              AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and  NOT  isn't  supported. OR isn't supported between different
              dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT  operators  aren't  sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported.  AND  and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to

       --sort-by (list)
          The value by which you want to sort the data.

          The key represents cost and usage metrics. The following values  are
          supported:

          o BlendedCost

          o UnblendedCost

          o AmortizedCost

          o NetAmortizedCost

          o NetUnblendedCost

          o UsageQuantity

          o NormalizedUsageAmount

          Supported values for SortOrder are ASCENDING or DESCENDING .

          When  using  SortBy  ,  NextPageToken  and SearchString are not sup-
          ported.

          (structure)
              The details of how to sort the data.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key that's used to sort the data.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order that's used to sort the data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "SortOrder": "ASCENDING"|"DESCENDING"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          This field is only used when SortBy is provided in the request.  The
          maximum  number  of objects that to be returned for this request. If
          MaxResults is not specified with SortBy,  the  request  will  return
          1000 results as the default value for this parameter.

          For GetTags , MaxResults has an upper limit of 1000.

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve keys and values for a cost allocation tag

       This example retrieves all cost allocation tags with a key of "Project"
       and a value that contains "secretProject".

       Command:

          aws ce get-tags --search-string secretProject --time-period Start=2017-01-01,End=2017-05-18 --tag-key Project

       Output:

          {
            "ReturnSize": 2,
            "Tags": [
              "secretProject1",
              "secretProject2"
            ],
            "TotalSize": 2
          }

OUTPUT
       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of retrievable results. Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  provides the token when the response from a previous call has
          more results than the maximum page size.

       Tags -> (list)
          The tags that match your request.

          (string)

       ReturnSize -> (integer)
          The number of query results that Amazon Web Services  returns  at  a
          time.

       TotalSize -> (integer)
          The total number of query results.
