GET-COST-AND-USAGE()                                      GET-COST-AND-USAGE()



NAME
       get-cost-and-usage -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  cost  and  usage  metrics  for your account. You can specify
       which cost and usage-related metric that you want the  request  to  re-
       turn.  For example, you can specify BlendedCosts or UsageQuantity . You
       can also filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as SER-
       VICE or AZ , in a specific time range. For a complete list of valid di-
       mensions, see the GetDimensionValues operation. Management  account  in
       an organization in Organizations have access to all member accounts.

       For  information  about filter limitations, see Quotas and restrictions
       in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            get-cost-and-usage
          --time-period <value>
          --granularity <value>
          [--filter <value>]
          --metrics <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          Sets the start date and end date for retrieving Amazon Web  Services
          costs.  The  start date is inclusive, but the end date is exclusive.
          For example, if start is 2017-01-01 and end is 2017-05-01 , then the
          cost and usage data is retrieved from 2017-01-01 up to and including
          2017-04-30 but not including 2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web Services re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --granularity (string)
          Sets  the Amazon Web Services cost granularity to MONTHLY or DAILY ,
          or HOURLY . If Granularity isn't set, the  response  object  doesn't
          include the Granularity , either MONTHLY or DAILY , or HOURLY .

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For exam-
          ple, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and  get  the  costs
          that  are  associated with that account's usage of that service. You
          can nest Expression objects to define any combination  of  dimension
          filters. For more information, see Expression .

          Valid values for MatchOptions for CostCategories and Tags are EQUALS
          , ABSENT , and CASE_SENSITIVE .

          The default values are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE . Valid values  for
          MatchOptions for Dimensions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

       --metrics (list)
          Which  metrics are returned in the query. For more information about
          blended and unblended rates, see Why does the  "blended"  annotation
          appear on some line items in my bill? .

          Valid  values  are  AmortizedCost , BlendedCost , NetAmortizedCost ,
          NetUnblendedCost , NormalizedUsageAmount , UnblendedCost ,  and  Us-
          ageQuantity .

          NOTE:
                 If  you  return  the UsageQuantity metric, the service aggre-
                 gates all usage  numbers  without  taking  into  account  the
                 units. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all
                 of Amazon EC2, the results aren't meaningful  because  Amazon
                 EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different
                 units (for example, hours and GB). To get more meaningful Us-
                 ageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups .

              Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsage requests.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --group-by (list)
          You  can  group  Amazon Web Services costs using up to two different
          groups, either dimensions, tag keys, cost  categories,  or  any  two
          group by types.

          Valid  values  for  the  DIMENSION type are AZ , INSTANCE_TYPE , LE-
          GAL_ENTITY_NAME , INVOICING_ENTITY , LINKED_ACCOUNT  ,  OPERATION  ,
          PLATFORM , PURCHASE_TYPE , SERVICE , TENANCY , RECORD_TYPE , and US-
          AGE_TYPE .

          When you group by the TAG type and include a valid tag key, you  get
          all tag values, including empty strings.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  group  when you specify a group by criteria or in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-page-token (string)
          The token to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon  Web  Services
          provides  the  token when the response from a previous call has more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of retrievable results. Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  provides the token when the response from a previous call has
          more results than the maximum page size.

       GroupDefinitions -> (list)
          The groups that are specified by the Filter or GroupBy parameters in
          the request.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  group  when you specify a group by criteria or in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       ResultsByTime -> (list)
          The time period that's covered by the results in the response.

          (structure)
              The result that's associated with a time period.

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The time period that the result covers.

                 Start -> (string)
                     The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  in-
                     clusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web
                     Services  retrieves  cost  and  usage  data  starting  at
                     2017-01-01  up  to  the  end date. The start date must be
                     equal to or no later than the current  date  to  avoid  a
                     validation error.

                 End -> (string)
                     The  end  of  the time period. The end date is exclusive.
                     For example, if end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon  Web  Services
                     retrieves  cost and usage data from the start date up to,
                     but not including, 2017-05-01 .

              Total -> (map)
