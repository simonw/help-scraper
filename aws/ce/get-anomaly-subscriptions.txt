NAME
       get-anomaly-subscriptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  cost anomaly subscription objects for your account. You
       can filter using a list of cost anomaly monitor Amazon  Resource  Names
       (ARNs).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-anomaly-subscriptions
          [--subscription-arn-list <value>]
          [--monitor-arn <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-arn-list (list)
          A list of cost anomaly subscription ARNs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --monitor-arn (string)
          Cost anomaly monitor ARNs.

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              the detailed metadata and the current status of the  AnomalySub-
              scription object.

              SubscriptionArn -> (string)

              AccountId -> (string)
                 Your unique account identifier.

              MonitorArnList -> (list)
                 A list of cost anomaly monitors.

                 (string)

                        Indicates if the subscriber accepts the notifications.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 The dollar value that triggers a notification if the  thresh-
                 old is exceeded.

              Frequency -> (string)
                 The frequency that anomaly reports are sent over email.

              SubscriptionName -> (string)
                 The name for the subscription.

       NextPageToken -> (string)
