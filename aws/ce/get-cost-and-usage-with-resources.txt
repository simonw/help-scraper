NAME
       get-cost-and-usage-with-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  cost  and usage metrics with resources for your account. You
       can specify which cost and usage-related metric, such  as  BlendedCosts
       or  UsageQuantity  ,  that you want the request to return. You can also
       filter and group your data by various dimensions, such as SERVICE or AZ
       ,  in  a  specific time range. For a complete list of valid dimensions,
       see the GetDimensionValues operation. Management account in an  organi-
       zation in Organizations have access to all member accounts. This API is
       currently available for the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  Compute  ser-
       vice only.

       NOTE:
          This is an opt-in only feature. You can enable this feature from the
          Cost Explorer Settings page. For information about how to access the
          Settings  page,  see  Controlling  Access  for  Cost Explorer in the
          Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          Sets the start and end dates  for  retrieving  Amazon  Web  Services
          costs.  The  range  must  be within the last 14 days (the start date
          cannot be earlier than 14 days ago). The start  date  is  inclusive,
          but  the  end date is exclusive. For example, if start is 2017-01-01
          and end is 2017-05-01 , then the cost and usage  data  is  retrieved
          from  2017-01-01  up  to  and including 2017-04-30 but not including
          2017-05-01 .

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web Services re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --granularity (string)
          Sets  the  Amazon Web Services cost granularity to MONTHLY , DAILY ,
          or HOURLY . If Granularity isn't set, the  response  object  doesn't
          include the Granularity , MONTHLY , DAILY , or HOURLY .

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters Amazon Web Services costs by different dimensions. For exam-
          ple, you can specify SERVICE and LINKED_ACCOUNT and  get  the  costs
          that  are  associated with that account's usage of that service. You
          can nest Expression objects to define any combination  of  dimension
          filters. For more information, see Expression .

          The  GetCostAndUsageWithResources operation requires that you either
          group by or filter by a ResourceId  .  It  requires  the  Expression
          "SERVICE = Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute" in the filter.

          Valid   values  for  MatchOptions  for  Dimensions  are  EQUALS  and
          CASE_SENSITIVE .

          Valid values for MatchOptions for CostCategories and Tags are EQUALS
          ,  ABSENT  ,  and  CASE_SENSITIVE  .  Default  values are EQUALS and
          CASE_SENSITIVE .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter in various Cost Explorer APIs.

                 Not all Expression types are supported in each API. Refer  to
                 the  documentation  for each specific API to see what is sup-
                 ported.

                 There are two patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values.

                   o There are three types of simple dimension  values:  Cost-
                     Categories , Tags , and Dimensions .

                     o Specify  the  CostCategories  field  to define a filter
                       that acts on Cost Categories.

                     o Specify the Tags field to define a filter that acts  on
                       Cost Allocation Tags.

                     o Specify  the  Dimensions  field to define a filter that
                       acts       on       the        `        DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For each filter type, you can set the dimension name  and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR
                       REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [
                       "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] } }

                     o As shown in the previous example,  lists  of  dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You  can also set different match options to further con-
                     trol how the filter behaves. Not all APIs  support  match
                     options. Refer to the documentation for each specific API
                     to see what is supported.

                     o For example, you can filter for  linked  account  names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME",  "MatchOptions":  [ "STARTS_WITH" ], "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators  AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Ex-
                     pression objects. By doing this, you can filter  by  more
                     advanced options.

                   o For  example,  you can filter by ((REGION == us-east-1 OR
                     REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type  ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                     AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) .

                   o The  corresponding Expression for this example is as fol-
                     lows: { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "RE-
                     GION",   "Values":   [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"  ]  }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because each Expression can have only one  operator,  the
                     service  returns  an error if more than one is specified.
                     The following example shows  an  Expression  object  that
                     creates  an  error:  {  "And":  [  ... ], "Dimensions": {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The following is an example of  the  corresponding  error
                     message:  "Expression  has  more than one roots. Only one
                     root operator is allowed for each  expression:  And,  Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                     The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  names  of  the metadata types that you can use to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                        Not all dimensions are supported in each API. Refer to
                        the documentation for each specific API to see what is
                        supported.
                            LINK_ACCOUNT_NAME  and  SERVICE_CODE  can  only be
                            used in CostCategoryRule .

                            ANOMALY_TOTAL_IMPACT_ABSOLUTE   and    ANOMALY_TO-
                            TAL_IMPACT_PERCENTAGE   can   only   be   used  in
                            AnomalySubscriptions .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to
                        find specific values.

                        (string)

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The match options that you can use to filter your  re-
                        sults.
                            MatchOptions  is  only  applicable for actions re-
                            lated to Cost Category and Anomaly  Subscriptions.
                            Refer  to  the documentation for each specific API
                            to see what is supported.

                        The default values for  MatchOptions  are  EQUALS  and

                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

                     o Specify the Dimensions field to define  a  filter  that
                       acts        on        the       `       DimensionValues
                       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_DimensionValues.html`__
                       .

                   o For  each filter type, you can set the dimension name and
                     values for the filters that you plan to use.

                     o For example, you can filter  for  REGION==us-east-1  OR
                       REGION==us-west-1  . For GetRightsizingRecommendation ,
                       the Region is a full name (for example, REGION==US East
                       (N. Virginia) .

                     o The  corresponding  Expression  for  this example is as
                       follows: { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [

                     o As  shown  in  the previous example, lists of dimension
                       values are combined with OR when applying the filter.

                   o You can also set different match options to further  con-
                     trol  how  the filter behaves. Not all APIs support match

                     to see what is supported.

                     o For  example,  you  can filter for linked account names
                       that start with "a".

                     o The corresponding Expression for  this  example  is  as
                       follows:   {   "Dimensions":   {   "Key":   "LINKED_AC-
                       COUNT_NAME", "MatchOptions": [ "STARTS_WITH"  ],  "Val-
                       ues": [ "a" ] } }

                 o Compound Expression types with logical operations.

                   o You can use multiple Expression types and the logical op-
                     erators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one  or  more  Ex-
                     pression  objects.  By doing this, you can filter by more
                     advanced options.

                   o For example, you can filter by ((REGION ==  us-east-1  OR
                     REGION  ==  us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-

                     GION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",  "us-west-1"   ]   }},
                     {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]},
                     {"Not": {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":
                     ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                     Because  each  Expression can have only one operator, the
                     service returns an error if more than one  is  specified.
                     The  following  example  shows  an Expression object that
                     creates an error: {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "Dimensions":  {
                     "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                     The  following  is  an example of the corresponding error
                     message: "Expression has more than one  roots.  Only  one
                     root  operator  is  allowed for each expression: And, Or,
                     Not, Dimensions, Tags, CostCategories"

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

       --metrics (list)
          Which metrics are returned in the query. For more information  about
          blended  and  unblended rates, see Why does the "blended" annotation
          appear on some line items in my bill? .

          Valid values are AmortizedCost , BlendedCost  ,  NetAmortizedCost  ,
          NetUnblendedCost  ,  NormalizedUsageAmount , UnblendedCost , and Us-
          ageQuantity .

          NOTE:
                 If you return the UsageQuantity metric,  the  service  aggre-
                 gates  all  usage  numbers  without taking the units into ac-
                 count. For example, if you aggregate usageQuantity across all
                 of  Amazon  EC2, the results aren't meaningful because Amazon
                 EC2 compute hours and data transfer are measured in different
                 units  (for  example, hour or GB). To get more meaningful Us-
                 ageQuantity metrics, filter by UsageType or UsageTypeGroups .

              Metrics is required for GetCostAndUsageWithResources requests.

          results than the maximum page size.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

OUTPUT
       NextPageToken -> (string)
          The  token  for the next set of retrievable results. Amazon Web Ser-
          vices provides the token when the response from a previous call  has
          more results than the maximum page size.
