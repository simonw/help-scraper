NAME
       get-rightsizing-recommendation -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates recommendations that help you save cost by identifying idle and
       underutilized Amazon EC2 instances.

       Recommendations are generated  to  either  downsize  or  terminate  in-
       stances,  along  with providing savings detail and metrics. For details
       on calculation and function, see Optimizing Your Cost with  Rightsizing
       Recommendations in the Billing and Cost Management User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --filter (structure)
          Use  Expression  to  filter  by cost or by usage. There are two pat-
          terns:

          o Simple dimension values - You can set the dimension name and  val-
            ues  for  the  filters  that you plan to use. For example, you can
            filter for REGION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For  GetRight-
            sizingRecommendation , the Region is a full name (for example, RE-
            GION==US East (N. Virginia) . The Expression example  is  as  fol-
            lows:  { "Dimensions": { "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",
            us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are  OR'd  together
            to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Expression and Di-
            mensionValues objects using either with* methods or  set*  methods
            in multiple lines.

          o Compound  dimension  values  with logical operations - You can use
            multiple Expression types and the logical operators AND/OR/NOT  to
            create  a  list  of one or more Expression objects. By doing this,
            you can filter on more advanced options. For example, you can fil-
            ter  on ((REGION == us-east-1 OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type
            == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The  Expression  for
            that  is  as follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":
            "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ]  }},  {"Tags":  {
            "Key":  "TagName",  "Values":  ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not": {"Dimen-
            sions": { "Key": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}} ] }

          NOTE:
                 Because each Expression can have only one operator, the  ser-
                 vice returns an error if more than one is specified. The fol-
                 lowing example shows an Expression object that creates an er-
                 ror.

              {  "And":  [  ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimension":  "US-
              AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

          NOTE:
              For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combination of OR
              and  NOT  isn't  supported. OR isn't supported between different
              dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT  operators  aren't  sup-
              ported. Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION ,
              or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

              For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only NOT is
              supported.  AND  and OR aren't supported. Dimensions are limited
              to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The metadata values that you can  use  to  filter  and
                        group  your results. You can use GetDimensionValues to
                        find specific values.

       --configuration (structure)
          Enables you to customize recommendations across two attributes.  You
          can choose to view recommendations for instances within the same in-
          stance families or across different instance families. You can  also
          choose  to  view  your estimated savings associated with recommenda-
          tions with consideration of existing Savings Plans or  RI  benefits,
          or neither.

          RecommendationTarget -> (string)
              The  option to see recommendations within the same instance fam-
              ily or recommendations for instances across other families.  The
              default value is SAME_INSTANCE_FAMILY .

          BenefitsConsidered -> (boolean)
              The  option to consider RI or Savings Plans discount benefits in
              your savings calculation. The default value is TRUE .

          }

       --service (string)
          The specific service that you want  recommendations  for.  The  only

          sponse object.

       --next-page-token (string)

          want to retrieve.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
