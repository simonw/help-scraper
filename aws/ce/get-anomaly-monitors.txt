NAME
       get-anomaly-monitors -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  cost  anomaly monitor definitions for your account. You
       can filter using a list of cost anomaly monitor Amazon  Resource  Names
       (ARNs).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-anomaly-monitors
          [--monitor-arn-list <value>]
          [--next-page-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --monitor-arn-list (list)
          A list of cost anomaly monitor ARNs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --next-page-token (string)
          The  token  to retrieve the next set of results. Amazon Web Services
          provides the token when the response from a previous call  has  more
          results than the maximum page size.

       --max-results (integer)
          The number of entries that a paginated response contains.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              MonitorDimension -> (string)
                 The dimensions to evaluate.

              MonitorSpecification -> (structure)
                 Use Expression to filter by cost or by usage. There  are  two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple  dimension  values  - You can set the dimension name
                   and values for the filters that you plan to use. For  exam-
                   ple,   you   can   filter   for  REGION==us-east-1  OR  RE-
                   GION==us-west-1 . For  GetRightsizingRecommendation  ,  the
                   Region  is  a  full  name (for example, REGION==US East (N.
                   Virginia) . The Expression example is as follows:   {  "Di-
                   mensions":  {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [ "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether  to  retrieve cost or usage data. You can create Ex-
                   pression and DimensionValues  objects  using  either  with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use multiple Expression types  and  the  logical  operators
                   AND/OR/NOT  to  create a list of one or more Expression ob-
                   jects. By doing this, you can filter on more  advanced  op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR REGION == us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type ==  Type1))  AND  (US-
                   AGE_TYPE  !=  DataTransfer) . The Expression for that is as
                   follows:  { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key":  "RE-
                   GION",  "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags":
                   { "Key": "TagName", "Values": ["Value1"] }  }  ]},  {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions":  {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values": ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because each Expression can have  only  one  operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified. The following example shows an  Expression  ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     {  "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension": "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For the GetRightsizingRecommendation action,  a  combina-
                     tion  of  OR  and NOT isn't supported. OR isn't supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators  aren't  supported. Dimensions are also limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     (structure)
                        Use Expression to filter by cost or  by  usage.  There
                        are two patterns:

                        o Simple  dimension values - You can set the dimension
                          name and values for the filters  that  you  plan  to
                          use.   For   example,   you   can   filter  for  RE-
                          GION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRight-
                          sizingRecommendation  ,  the  Region  is a full name
                          (for example, REGION==US East (N.  Virginia)  .  The
                          Expression example is as follows:  { "Dimensions": {
                          "Key": "REGION", "Values": [ "us-east-1",  us-west-1
                          ]  }  }    The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                          gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  cre-
                          ate Expression and DimensionValues objects using ei-
                          ther with*  methods  or  set*  methods  in  multiple
                          lines.

                        o Compound  dimension values with logical operations -
                          You can use multiple Expression types and the  logi-
                          cal  operators AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or
                          more Expression objects. By doing this, you can fil-
                          ter  on  more advanced options. For example, you can
                          filter  on  ((REGION  ==  us-east-1  OR  REGION   ==
                          us-west-1)  OR  (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (USAGE_TYPE
                          != DataTransfer) . The Expression  for  that  is  as
                          follows:   {  "And":  [  {"Or":  [  {"Dimensions": {
                          "Key":   "REGION",    "Values":    [    "us-east-1",
                          "us-west-1" ] }}, {"Tags": { "Key": "TagName", "Val-
                          ues": ["Value1"] } } ]},  {"Not":  {"Dimensions":  {
                          "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": ["DataTransfer"] }}}
                          ] }

                        NOTE:
                               Because each Expression can have only one oper-
                               ator, the service returns an error if more than
                               one is specified. The following  example  shows
                               an Expression object that creates an error.

                            {  "And":  [  ...  ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimen-
                            sion": "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer"  ]
                            } }

                        NOTE:
                            For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation  action,  a
                            combination of OR  and  NOT  isn't  supported.  OR
                            isn't  supported  between different dimensions, or
                            dimensions and tags.  NOT  operators  aren't  sup-
                            ported.  Dimensions are also limited to LINKED_AC-
                            COUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                            For the  GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation  ac-
                            tion,  only  NOT  is  supported. AND and OR aren't
                            supported. Dimensions are  limited  to  LINKED_AC-
                            COUNT .

                        Or -> (list)
                            Return results that match either Dimension object.

                        And -> (list)
                            Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        ( ... recursive ... )Dimensions -> (structure)
                            The specific Dimension to use for Expression .

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  names  of  the metadata types that you can
                               use to filter and group your results. For exam-
                               ple, AZ returns a list of Availability Zones.

                            Values -> (list)
                               The  metadata values that you can use to filter
                               and group your results. You can  use  GetDimen-
                               sionValues to find specific values.

                               your results. MatchOptions is  only  applicable
                               for  actions  related to Cost Category. The de-
                               fault values for MatchOptions  are  EQUALS  and
                               CASE_SENSITIVE .

                          GION==us-east-1 OR REGION==us-west-1 . For GetRight-

                          (for  example,  REGION==US  East (N. Virginia) . The
                          Expression example is as follows:  { "Dimensions": {

                               one  is  specified. The following example shows
                               an Expression object that creates an error.

                            { "And": [ ...  ],  "DimensionValues":  {  "Dimen-
                            sion":  "USAGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ]
                            } }
