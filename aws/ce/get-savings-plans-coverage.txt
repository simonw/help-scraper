GET-SAVINGS-PLANS-COVERAGE()                      GET-SAVINGS-PLANS-COVERAGE()



NAME
       get-savings-plans-coverage -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the Savings Plans covered for your account. This enables you
       to see how much of your cost is covered by a Savings Plan. An organiza-
       tions  management account can see the coverage of the associated member
       accounts. This supports dimensions, Cost Categories, and nested expres-
       sions. For any time period, you can filter data for Savings Plans usage
       with the following dimensions:

       o LINKED_ACCOUNT

       o REGION

       o SERVICE

       o INSTANCE_FAMILY

       To determine valid values for a dimension, use  the  GetDimensionValues
       operation.

SYNOPSIS
            get-savings-plans-coverage
          --time-period <value>
          [--group-by <value>]
          [--granularity <value>]
          [--filter <value>]
          [--metrics <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--sort-by <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --time-period (structure)
          The  time  period  that  you want the usage and costs for. The Start
          date must be within 13 months. The End date must be after the  Start
          date,  and before the current date. Future dates can't be used as an
          End date.

          Start -> (string)
              The beginning of the time period. The start date  is  inclusive.
              For  example,  if  start is 2017-01-01 , Amazon Web Services re-
              trieves cost and usage data starting at 2017-01-01 up to the end
              date.  The start date must be equal to or no later than the cur-
              rent date to avoid a validation error.

          End -> (string)
              The end of the time period. The end date is exclusive. For exam-
              ple,  if  end is 2017-05-01 , Amazon Web Services retrieves cost
              and usage data from the start date up  to,  but  not  including,
              2017-05-01 .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=string,End=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": "string",
            "End": "string"
          }

       --group-by (list)
          You can group the data using the attributes INSTANCE_FAMILY , REGION
          , or SERVICE .

          (structure)
              Represents a group when you specify a group by  criteria  or  in
              the response to a query with a specific grouping.

              Type -> (string)
                 The string that represents the type of group.

              Key -> (string)
                 The string that represents a key for a specified group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Key=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "DIMENSION"|"TAG"|"COST_CATEGORY",
              "Key": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --granularity (string)
          The  granularity  of the Amazon Web Services cost data for your Sav-
          ings Plans. Granularity can't be set if GroupBy is set.

          The  GetSavingsPlansCoverage  operation  supports  only  DAILY   and
          MONTHLY granularities.

          Possible values:

          o DAILY

          o MONTHLY

          o HOURLY

       --filter (structure)
          Filters  Savings  Plans  coverage data by dimensions. You can filter
          data for Savings Plans usage with the following dimensions:

          o LINKED_ACCOUNT

          o REGION

          o SERVICE

          o INSTANCE_FAMILY
              GetSavingsPlansCoverage uses the same Expression object  as  the
              other  operations,  but  only AND is supported among each dimen-
              sion. If there are multiple values for  a  dimension,  they  are
              OR'd together.

          Cost category is also supported.

          Or -> (list)
              Return results that match either Dimension object.

              (structure)
                 Use  Expression  to filter by cost or by usage. There are two
                 patterns:

                 o Simple dimension values - You can set  the  dimension  name
                   and  values for the filters that you plan to use. For exam-
                   ple,  you  can  filter   for   REGION==us-east-1   OR   RE-
                   GION==us-west-1  .  For  GetRightsizingRecommendation , the
                   Region is a full name (for  example,  REGION==US  East  (N.
                   Virginia)  .  The Expression example is as follows:  { "Di-
                   mensions": {  "Key":  "REGION",  "Values":  [  "us-east-1",
                   us-west-1 ] } }   The list of dimension values are OR'd to-
                   gether to retrieve cost or usage data. You can  create  Ex-
                   pression  and  DimensionValues  objects  using either with*
                   methods or set* methods in multiple lines.

                 o Compound dimension values with logical operations - You can
                   use  multiple  Expression  types  and the logical operators
                   AND/OR/NOT to create a list of one or more  Expression  ob-
                   jects.  By  doing this, you can filter on more advanced op-
                   tions. For example, you can filter on ((REGION == us-east-1
                   OR  REGION  ==  us-west-1) OR (TAG.Type == Type1)) AND (US-
                   AGE_TYPE != DataTransfer) . The Expression for that  is  as
                   follows:   { "And": [ {"Or": [ {"Dimensions": { "Key": "RE-
                   GION", "Values": [ "us-east-1", "us-west-1" ] }},  {"Tags":
                   {  "Key":  "TagName",  "Values": ["Value1"] } } ]}, {"Not":
                   {"Dimensions": {  "Key":  "USAGE_TYPE",  "Values":  ["Data-
                   Transfer"] }}} ] }

                 NOTE:
                        Because  each  Expression  can have only one operator,
                        the service returns an error if more than one is spec-
                        ified.  The  following example shows an Expression ob-
                        ject that creates an error.

                     { "And": [ ... ], "DimensionValues": { "Dimension":  "US-
                     AGE_TYPE", "Values": [ "DataTransfer" ] } }

                 NOTE:
                     For  the  GetRightsizingRecommendation action, a combina-
                     tion of OR and NOT isn't supported.  OR  isn't  supported
                     between different dimensions, or dimensions and tags. NOT
                     operators aren't supported. Dimensions are  also  limited
                     to LINKED_ACCOUNT , REGION , or RIGHTSIZING_TYPE .

                     For the GetReservationPurchaseRecommendation action, only
                     NOT is supported. AND and OR aren't supported. Dimensions
                     are limited to LINKED_ACCOUNT .

                 Or -> (list)
                     Return results that match either Dimension object.

                     ( ... recursive ... )

                 And -> (list)
                     Return results that match both Dimension objects.

                        The  names  of  the metadata types that you can use to
                        filter and group your results. For example, AZ returns
                        a list of Availability Zones.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The  metadata  values  that  you can use to filter and
                        group your results. You can use GetDimensionValues  to
                        find specific values.

                     MatchOptions -> (list)
                        The  match options that you can use to filter your re-
                        sults. MatchOptions is only applicable for actions re-
                        lated   to  Cost  Category.  The  default  values  for
                        MatchOptions are EQUALS and CASE_SENSITIVE .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
