GET-CACHE-POLICY-CONFIG()                            GET-CACHE-POLICY-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-cache-policy-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a cache policy configuration.

       To get a cache policy configuration, you must provide the policys iden-
       tifier. If the cache policy is attached to a distributions cache behav-
       ior, you can get the policys identifier using ListDistributions or Get-
       Distribution . If the cache policy is not attached to a cache behavior,
       you can get the identifier using ListCachePolicies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-cache-policy-config
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier for the cache policy. If the cache policy is
          attached to a distributions cache behavior, you can get the  policys
          identifier using ListDistributions or GetDistribution . If the cache
          policy is not attached to a cache behavior, you can get the  identi-
          fier using ListCachePolicies .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
          The cache policy configuration.

          Comment -> (string)
              A  comment  to  describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be
              longer than 128 characters.

          Name -> (string)
              A unique name to identify the cache policy.

          DefaultTTL -> (long)
              The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
              stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another re-
              quest to the origin to see  if  the  object  has  been  updated.
              CloudFront  uses  this  value  as the objects time to live (TTL)
              only when the origin does  not  send  Cache-Control  or  Expires
              headers  with the object. For more information, see Managing How
              Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in  the  Amazon
              CloudFront Developer Guide .

              The  default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day). If
              the value of MinTTL is more than 86400 seconds, then the default
              value for this field is the same as the value of MinTTL .

          MaxTTL -> (long)
              The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the
              CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to  the
              origin  to  see  if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses
              this value only when the origin sends Cache-Control  or  Expires
              headers  with the object. For more information, see Managing How
              Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in  the  Amazon
              CloudFront Developer Guide .

              The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year).
              If the value of MinTTL or DefaultTTL is more than 31536000  sec-
              onds,  then  the default value for this field is the same as the
              value of DefaultTTL .

          MinTTL -> (long)
              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
              stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another re-
              quest to the origin to see if the object has been  updated.  For
              more information, see Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge
              Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin -> (structure)
              The HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings to  include  in
              the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automat-
              ically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

              EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                 A flag that  can  affect  whether  the  Accept-Encoding  HTTP
                 header  is included in the cache key and included in requests
                 that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 This  field  is  related  to  the  EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli
                 field. If one or both of these fields is true  and the viewer
                 request includes the Accept-Encoding header, then  CloudFront
                 does the following:

                 o Normalizes the value of the viewers Accept-Encoding header

                 o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                 o Includes  the  normalized header in the request to the ori-
                   gin, if a request is necessary

                 For more information, see Compression support in  the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If  you set this value to true , and this cache behavior also
                 has an origin request policy attached, do not include the Ac-
                 cept-Encoding header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                 always includes the Accept-Encoding header in origin requests
                 when  the  value  of  this  field is true , so including this
                 header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 If both of these fields are false ,  then  CloudFront  treats
                 the  Accept-Encoding header the same as any other HTTP header
                 in the viewer request. By default, its not  included  in  the
                 cache  key  and  its not included in origin requests. In this
                 case, you can manually add  Accept-Encoding  to  the  headers
                 whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                 A  flag  that  can  affect  whether  the Accept-Encoding HTTP
                 header is included in the cache key and included in  requests
                 that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 This  field is related to the EnableAcceptEncodingGzip field.
                 If one or both of these fields is true  and  the  viewer  re-
                 quest  includes  the  Accept-Encoding header, then CloudFront
                 does the following:

                 o Normalizes the value of the viewers Accept-Encoding header

                 o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                 o Includes the normalized header in the request to  the  ori-
                   gin, if a request is necessary

                 For  more  information, see Compression support in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If you set this value to true , and this cache behavior  also
                 has an origin request policy attached, do not include the Ac-
                 cept-Encoding header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                 always includes the Accept-Encoding header in origin requests
                 when the value of this field is  true  ,  so  including  this
                 header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 If  both  of  these fields are false , then CloudFront treats
                 the Accept-Encoding header the same as any other HTTP  header
                 in  the  viewer  request. By default, its not included in the
                 cache key and its not included in origin  requests.  In  this
                 case,  you  can  manually  add Accept-Encoding to the headers
                 whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                 An object that determines whether any HTTP  headers  (and  if
                 so, which headers) are included in the cache key and automat-
                 ically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the ori-
                 gin.

                 HeaderBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines  whether  any HTTP headers are included in the
                     cache key and automatically  included  in  requests  that
                     CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

                     o none   HTTP  headers  are not included in the cache key
                       and are not automatically  included  in  requests  that
                       CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is
                       set to none , any headers that are listed in an Origin-
                       RequestPolicy  are included in origin requests.

                     o whitelist   The  HTTP  headers  that  are listed in the
                       Headers type are included in the cache key and are  au-
                       tomatically  included in requests that CloudFront sends
                       to the origin.

                 Headers -> (structure)
                     Contains a list of HTTP header names.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of header names in the Items list.

                     Items -> (list)

                        (string)

              CookiesConfig -> (structure)
                 An object that determines whether any cookies in  viewer  re-
                 quests  (and  if so, which cookies) are included in the cache
                 key and automatically included in  requests  that  CloudFront
                 sends to the origin.

                 CookieBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines whether any cookies in viewer requests are in-
                     cluded in the cache key and automatically included in re-
                     quests  that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values
                     are:

                     o none  Cookies in viewer requests are  not  included  in
                       the cache key and are not automatically included in re-
                       quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.  Even  when
                       this field is set to none , any cookies that are listed
                       in an OriginRequestPolicy  are included in  origin  re-
                       quests.

                     o whitelist   The  cookies  in  viewer  requests that are
                       listed in the CookieNames  type  are  included  in  the
                       cache  key  and automatically included in requests that
                       CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o allExcept  All cookies in viewer requests  that  are  *
                       not  *  listed  in the CookieNames type are included in
                       the cache key and automatically  included  in  requests
                       that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o all  All cookies in viewer requests are included in the
                       cache key and are automatically  included  in  requests

                 Cookies -> (structure)
                     Contains a list of cookie names.

                     Quantity -> (integer)

                     Items -> (list)
                        A list of cookie names.

                        (string)

              QueryStringsConfig -> (structure)
                 An  object  that  determines whether any URL query strings in
                 viewer requests (and if so, which query strings) are included
                 in  the cache key and automatically included in requests that
                 CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 QueryStringBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines whether any URL query strings  in  viewer  re-
                     quests  are  included  in the cache key and automatically
                     included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
                     Valid values are:

                     o none  Query strings in viewer requests are not included
                       in the cache key and are not automatically included  in
                       requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when
                       this field is set to none , any query strings that  are
                       listed  in an OriginRequestPolicy  are included in ori-
                       gin requests.

                     o whitelist  The query strings in  viewer  requests  that
                       are listed in the QueryStringNames type are included in
