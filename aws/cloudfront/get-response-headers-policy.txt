GET-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICY()                    GET-RESPONSE-HEADERS-POLICY()



NAME
       get-response-headers-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a response headers policy, including metadata (the policys identi-
       fier and the date and time when the policy was last modified).

       To get a response headers policy, you must provide the policys  identi-
       fier.  If  the  response  headers policy is attached to a distributions
       cache behavior, you can get the policys identifier using  ListDistribu-
       tions  or  GetDistribution  . If the response headers policy is not at-
       tached to a cache behavior, you can get the  identifier  using  ListRe-
       sponseHeadersPolicies .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-response-headers-policy
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier for the response headers policy.

          If  the response headers policy is attached to a distributions cache
          behavior, you can get the policys identifier using ListDistributions
          or  GetDistribution . If the response headers policy is not attached
          to a cache behavior, you can get the identifier using  ListResponse-
          HeadersPolicies .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResponseHeadersPolicy -> (structure)
          Contains a response headers policy.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the response headers policy.

              HTTP response headers and  their  values.  CloudFront  adds  the
              headers  in  the  policy to HTTP responses that it sends for re-
              quests that match a cache behavior  thats  associated  with  the
              policy.
