GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                            GET-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       get-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a real-time log configuration.

       To  get  a  real-time log configuration, you can provide the configura-
       tions name or its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). You must provide at least
       one.  If  you  provide  both,  CloudFront uses the name to identify the
       real-time log configuration to get.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-realtime-log-config
          [--name <value>]
          [--arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the real-time log configuration to get.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the real-time log configuration to
          get.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RealtimeLogConfig -> (structure)
          A real-time log configuration.

          ARN -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this real-time log  configura-
              tion.

          Name -> (string)
              The unique name of this real-time log configuration.

          SamplingRate -> (long)
              The sampling rate for this real-time log configuration. The sam-
              pling rate determines the percentage of viewer requests that are
              represented  in  the real-time log data. The sampling rate is an
              integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

          EndPoints -> (list)
              Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream  where
              you  are  sending real-time log data for this real-time log con-
              figuration.

              (structure)
                 Contains information about the  Amazon  Kinesis  data  stream
                 where  you  are sending real-time log data in a real-time log
                 configuration.

                 StreamType -> (string)
                     The type of data stream where you are  sending  real-time
                     log data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

                 KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

                     RoleARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and  Ac-
                        cess  Management (IAM) role that CloudFront can use to
                        send real-time log data to your Kinesis data stream.

                        For more information the IAM role, see  Real-time  log
                        configuration IAM role in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                     StreamARN -> (string)
                        The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  Kinesis  data
                        stream where you are sending real-time log data.

          Fields -> (list)
              A list of fields that are included in each real-time log record.
              In an API response, the fields are provided in the same order in
              which they are sent to the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

              For  more information about fields, see Real-time log configura-
              tion fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .
