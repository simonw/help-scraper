          The request to create a new field-level encryption configuration.

          CallerReference -> (string)

              be longer than 128 characters.

          QueryArgProfileConfig -> (structure)
              A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if  a
              profile  isn't  found  and the profile that can be provided as a
              query argument in a request.

              ForwardWhenQueryArgProfileIsUnknown -> (boolean)
                 Flag to set if you want a request to be forwarded to the ori-
                 gin  even if the profile specified by the field-level encryp-
                 tion query argument, fle-profile, is unknown.

              QueryArgProfiles -> (structure)
                 Profiles specified for  query  argument-profile  mapping  for
                 field-level encryption.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     Number of profiles for query argument-profile mapping for

          ContentTypeProfileConfig -> (structure)
              A complex data type that specifies when to forward content if  a
              content  type isn't recognized and profiles to use as by default
              in a request if a query argument doesn't specify  a  profile  to
              use.

              ForwardWhenContentTypeIsUnknown -> (boolean)
                 The  setting in a field-level encryption content type-profile
                 mapping that specifies what to do  when  an  unknown  content

                 warded without being encrypted when the content type  is  un-
                 known.  If false (the default), an error is returned when the

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a CloudFront field-level encryption configuration

       The following example creates a field-level encryption configuration by
       providing the configuration parameters in a JSON  file  named  fle-con-
       fig.json. Before you can create a field-level encryption configuration,
       you must have a field-level encryption profile. To  create  a  profile,
       see the create-field-level-encryption-profile command.

       For more information about CloudFront field-level encryption, see Using
       Field-Level Encryption to Help Protect Sensitive  Data  in  the  Amazon
       CloudFront Developer Guide.

       contains the following:
