UPDATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                      UPDATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       update-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a real-time log configuration.

       When  you  update a real-time log configuration, all the parameters are
       updated with the values provided in the request. You cannot update some
       parameters  independent of others. To update a real-time log configura-
       tion:

       o Call GetRealtimeLogConfig to get the current real-time log configura-
         tion.

       o Locally modify the parameters in the real-time log configuration that
         you want to update.

       o Call this API (UpdateRealtimeLogConfig  )  by  providing  the  entire
         real-time  log configuration, including the parameters that you modi-
         fied and those that you didnt.

       You cannot update a real-time log configurations Name or ARN .

OPTIONS
       --end-points (list)
          Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where  you
          are sending real-time log data.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where
              you are sending real-time log data in a real-time log configura-
              tion.

              StreamType -> (string)
                 The  type  of data stream where you are sending real-time log
                 data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

              KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the  Amazon  Kinesis  data  stream
                 where you are sending real-time log data.

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
                     Management (IAM) role that CloudFront  can  use  to  send
                     real-time log data to your Kinesis data stream.

                     For more information the IAM role, see Real-time log con-
                     figuration IAM role in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                     Guide .

                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StreamType=string,KinesisStreamConfig={RoleARN=string,StreamARN=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StreamType": "string",
              "KinesisStreamConfig": {
                "RoleARN": "string",
                "StreamARN": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --fields (list)
          A list of fields to include in each real-time log record.

          For more information about fields, see Real-time  log  configuration
          fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --name (string)
          The name for this real-time log configuration.

       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for this real-time log configuration.

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The sampling rate for this real-time log configuration. The sampling
          rate determines the percentage of viewer requests  that  are  repre-
          sented  in  the  real-time log data. You must provide an integer be-
          tween 1 and 100, inclusive.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 StreamType -> (string)
                     The type of data stream where you are  sending  real-time

              A list of fields that are included in each real-time log record.
              In an API response, the fields are provided in the same order in
              which they are sent to the Amazon Kinesis data stream.
