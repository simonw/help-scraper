NAME
       update-response-headers-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a response headers policy.

       When  you  update  a  response headers policy, the entire policy is re-
       placed. You cannot update some policy fields independent of others.  To
       update a response headers policy configuration:

       o Use GetResponseHeadersPolicyConfig to get the current policys config-
         uration.

       o Modify the fields in the response headers policy  configuration  that
         you want to update.

       o Call  UpdateResponseHeadersPolicy  ,  providing  the  entire response
         headers policy configuration, including the fields that you  modified
         and those that you didnt.

                 header to. When you set the sampling rate to 100,  CloudFront
                 adds  the Server-Timing header to the HTTP response for every
                 request that matches the cache behavior  that  this  response
                 headers  policy is attached to. When you set it to 50, Cloud-
                 Front adds the header to 50% of the  responses  for  requests
                 that  match the cache behavior. You can set the sampling rate
                 to any number 0100 with up to four decimal places.

       --id (string)
          The identifier for the response headers policy that you  are  updat-
          ing.

       --if-match (string)
          The version of the response headers policy that you are updating.

          The  version  is returned in the cache policys ETag field in the re-
          sponse to GetResponseHeadersPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        port-Security HTTP response header.

                     Preload -> (boolean)
                        A  Boolean that determines whether CloudFront includes
                        the preload directive in the Strict-Transport-Security
                        HTTP response header.

                     AccessControlMaxAgeSec -> (integer)
                        A  number  that  CloudFront  uses as the value for the
                        max-age  directive  in  the  Strict-Transport-Security
                        HTTP response header.

              CustomHeadersConfig -> (structure)
                 A configuration for a set of custom HTTP response headers.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of HTTP response headers in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     The list of HTTP response headers and their values.

                     (structure)
                        An HTTP response header name and its value. CloudFront
                        includes this header in HTTP responses that  it  sends
                        for requests that match a cache behavior thats associ-
                        ated with this response headers policy.

                        Header -> (string)
                            The HTTP response header name.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the HTTP response header.

                        Override -> (boolean)
                            A Boolean that determines whether CloudFront over-
                            rides  a  response  header  with the same name re-
                            ceived from the origin with the  header  specified
                            here.

              ServerTimingHeadersConfig -> (structure)
                 A configuration for enabling the Server-Timing header in HTTP
                 responses sent from CloudFront.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     A Boolean that determines  whether  CloudFront  adds  the
                     Server-Timing  header  to HTTP responses that it sends in
                     response to requests that match a cache  behavior  that's
                     associated with this response headers policy.

                 SamplingRate -> (double)
                     A  number  0100 (inclusive) that specifies the percentage
                     of  responses  that  you  want  CloudFront  to  add   the
                     Server-Timing  header  to. When you set the sampling rate
                     to 100, CloudFront adds the Server-Timing header  to  the
                     HTTP  response  for  every request that matches the cache
                     behavior that this response headers  policy  is  attached
                     to.  When you set it to 50, CloudFront adds the header to
                     50% of the responses for requests that  match  the  cache
                     behavior.  You  can  set  the sampling rate to any number
                     0100 with up to four decimal places.

       ETag -> (string)
          The current version of the response headers policy.
