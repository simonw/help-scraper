PUBLISH-FUNCTION()                                          PUBLISH-FUNCTION()



NAME
       publish-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Publishes  a  CloudFront function by copying the function code from the
       DEVELOPMENT stage to LIVE . This automatically updates all cache behav-
       iors  that  are  using this function to use the newly published copy in
       the LIVE stage.

       When a function is published to the LIVE  stage,  you  can  attach  the
       function  to a distributions cache behavior, using the functions Amazon
       Resource Name (ARN).

       To publish a function, you must provide the functions name and  version
       (ETag  value).  To  get these values, you can use ListFunctions and De-
       scribeFunction .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            publish-function
          --name <value>
          --if-match <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the function that you are publishing.

       --if-match (string)
          The current version (ETag value) of the function that you  are  pub-
          lishing, which you can get using DescribeFunction .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FunctionSummary -> (structure)
          Contains configuration information and metadata about  a  CloudFront
          function.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the CloudFront function.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the CloudFront function.

          FunctionConfig -> (structure)
              Contains configuration information about a CloudFront function.

              Comment -> (string)
                 A comment to describe the function.

              Runtime -> (string)
                 The  functions  runtime  environment. The only valid value is
                 cloudfront-js-1.0 .

          FunctionMetadata -> (structure)
              Contains metadata about a CloudFront function.

              FunctionARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the  function.  The  ARN
                 uniquely identifies the function.

              Stage -> (string)
                 The stage that the function is in, either DEVELOPMENT or LIVE
                 .

                 When a function is in the DEVELOPMENT stage, you can test the
                 function  with  TestFunction , and update it with UpdateFunc-
                 tion .

                 When a function is in the LIVE  stage,  you  can  attach  the
                 function  to  a distributions cache behavior, using the func-
                 tions ARN.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the function was created.

              LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the function  was  most  recently  up-
                 dated.
