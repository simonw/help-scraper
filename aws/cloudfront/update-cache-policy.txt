NAME
       update-cache-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates a cache policy configuration.

       When  you  update  a cache policy configuration, all the fields are up-
       dated with the values provided in the request. You cannot  update  some
       fields independent of others. To update a cache policy configuration:

       o Use GetCachePolicyConfig to get the current configuration.

       o Locally  modify the fields in the cache policy configuration that you
         want to update.

       o Call UpdateCachePolicy by providing the entire cache policy  configu-
         ration,  including  the  fields  that you modified and those that you
         didnt.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-cache-policy
          --cache-policy-config <value>
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cache-policy-config (structure)
          A cache policy configuration.

          Comment -> (string)
              A comment to describe the cache policy. The  comment  cannot  be
              longer than 128 characters.

          Name -> (string)
              A unique name to identify the cache policy.

          DefaultTTL -> (long)
              The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
              stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another re-
              quest  to  the  origin  to  see  if the object has been updated.
              CloudFront uses this value as the objects  time  to  live  (TTL)
              only  when  the  origin  does  not send Cache-Control or Expires
              headers with the object. For more information, see Managing  How
              Long  Content  Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon
              CloudFront Developer Guide .

              The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one day).  If
              the value of MinTTL is more than 86400 seconds, then the default
              value for this field is the same as the value of MinTTL .

          MaxTTL -> (long)
              The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in the
              CloudFront  cache before CloudFront sends another request to the
              origin to see if the object has been  updated.  CloudFront  uses
              this  value  only when the origin sends Cache-Control or Expires
              headers with the object. For more information, see Managing  How
              Long  Content  Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon
              CloudFront Developer Guide .

              The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year).
              If  the value of MinTTL or DefaultTTL is more than 31536000 sec-
              onds, then the default value for this field is the same  as  the
              value of DefaultTTL .

          MinTTL -> (long)
              The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects to
              stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another re-
              quest  to  the origin to see if the object has been updated. For
              more information, see Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge
              Cache (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin -> (structure)
              The  HTTP  headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include in
              the cache key. The values included in the cache key are automat-
              ically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

              EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                 A  flag  that  can  affect  whether  the Accept-Encoding HTTP
                 header is included in the cache key and included in  requests
                 that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 This  field  is  related  to  the  EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli
                 field. If one or both of these fields is true  and the viewer
                 request  includes the Accept-Encoding header, then CloudFront
                 does the following:

                 o Normalizes the value of the viewers Accept-Encoding header

                 o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                 o Includes the normalized header in the request to  the  ori-
                   gin, if a request is necessary

                 For  more  information, see Compression support in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If you set this value to true , and this cache behavior  also
                 has an origin request policy attached, do not include the Ac-
                 cept-Encoding header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                 always includes the Accept-Encoding header in origin requests
                 when the value of this field is  true  ,  so  including  this
                 header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 If  both  of  these fields are false , then CloudFront treats
                 the Accept-Encoding header the same as any other HTTP  header
                 in  the  viewer  request. By default, its not included in the
                 cache key and its not included in origin  requests.  In  this
                 case,  you  can  manually  add Accept-Encoding to the headers
                 whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli -> (boolean)
                 A flag that  can  affect  whether  the  Accept-Encoding  HTTP
                 header  is included in the cache key and included in requests
                 that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 This field is related to the EnableAcceptEncodingGzip  field.
                 If  one  or  both of these fields is true  and the viewer re-
                 quest includes the Accept-Encoding  header,  then  CloudFront
                 does the following:

                 o Normalizes the value of the viewers Accept-Encoding header

                 o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                 o Includes  the  normalized header in the request to the ori-
                   gin, if a request is necessary

                 For more information, see Compression support in  the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If  you set this value to true , and this cache behavior also
                 has an origin request policy attached, do not include the Ac-
                 cept-Encoding header in the origin request policy. CloudFront
                 always includes the Accept-Encoding header in origin requests
                 when  the  value  of  this  field is true , so including this
                 header in an origin request policy has no effect.

                 If both of these fields are false ,  then  CloudFront  treats
                 the  Accept-Encoding header the same as any other HTTP header
                 in the viewer request. By default, its not  included  in  the
                 cache  key  and  its not included in origin requests. In this
                 case, you can manually add  Accept-Encoding  to  the  headers
                 whitelist like any other HTTP header.

              HeadersConfig -> (structure)
                 An  object  that  determines whether any HTTP headers (and if
                 so, which headers) are included in the cache key and automat-
                 ically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the ori-
                 gin.

                 HeaderBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines whether any HTTP headers are included  in  the
                     cache  key  and  automatically  included in requests that
                     CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are:

                     o none  HTTP headers are not included in  the  cache  key
                       and  are  not  automatically  included in requests that
                       CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when this field is
                       set to none , any headers that are listed in an Origin-
                       RequestPolicy  are included in origin requests.

                     o whitelist  The HTTP headers  that  are  listed  in  the
                       Headers  type are included in the cache key and are au-
                       tomatically included in requests that CloudFront  sends
                       to the origin.

                 Headers -> (structure)
                     Contains a list of HTTP header names.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of header names in the Items list.

                     Items -> (list)
                        A list of HTTP header names.

                        (string)

              CookiesConfig -> (structure)
                 An  object  that determines whether any cookies in viewer re-
                 quests (and if so, which cookies) are included in  the  cache
                 key  and  automatically  included in requests that CloudFront
                 sends to the origin.

                 CookieBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines whether any cookies in viewer requests are in-
                     cluded in the cache key and automatically included in re-
                     quests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid  values
                     are:

                     o none   Cookies  in  viewer requests are not included in
                       the cache key and are not automatically included in re-
                       quests  that  CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when
                       this field is set to none , any cookies that are listed
                       in  an  OriginRequestPolicy  are included in origin re-
                       quests.

                     o whitelist  The cookies  in  viewer  requests  that  are
                       listed  in  the  CookieNames  type  are included in the
                       cache key and automatically included in  requests  that
                       CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o allExcept   All  cookies  in viewer requests that are *
                       not * listed in the CookieNames type  are  included  in
                       the  cache  key  and automatically included in requests
                       that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o all  All cookies in viewer requests are included in the
                       cache  key  and  are automatically included in requests
                       that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 Cookies -> (structure)
                     Contains a list of cookie names.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of cookie names in the Items list.

                     Items -> (list)
                        A list of cookie names.

                        (string)

              QueryStringsConfig -> (structure)
                 An object that determines whether any URL  query  strings  in
                 viewer requests (and if so, which query strings) are included
                 in the cache key and automatically included in requests  that
                 CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 QueryStringBehavior -> (string)
                     Determines  whether  any  URL query strings in viewer re-
                     quests are included in the cache  key  and  automatically
                     included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.
                     Valid values are:

                     o none  Query strings in viewer requests are not included
                       in  the cache key and are not automatically included in
                       requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Even when
                       this  field is set to none , any query strings that are
                       listed in an OriginRequestPolicy  are included in  ori-
                       gin requests.

                     o whitelist   The  query  strings in viewer requests that
                       are listed in the QueryStringNames type are included in
                       the  cache  key  and automatically included in requests
                       that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o allExcept  All query strings in  viewer  requests  that
                       are * not * listed in the QueryStringNames type are in-
                       cluded in the cache key and automatically  included  in
                       requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     o all   All query strings in viewer requests are included
                       in the cache key and are automatically included in  re-
                       quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                 QueryStrings -> (structure)
                     Contains  the  specific  query strings in viewer requests
                     that either * are * or * are not * included in the  cache
                     key  and  automatically  included in requests that Cloud-
                     Front sends  to  the  origin.  The  behavior  depends  on
                     whether the QueryStringBehavior field in the CachePolicy-
                     QueryStringsConfig type is set to whitelist  (the  listed
                     query  strings * are * included) or allExcept (the listed
                     query strings * are not * included, but all  other  query
                     strings are).

       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for the cache policy that you are updating.
          The identifier is returned in a cache behaviors CachePolicyId  field
          in the response to GetDistributionConfig .

       --if-match (string)
          The  version  of the cache policy that you are updating. The version
          is returned in the cache policys ETag field in the response to  Get-
          CachePolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       CachePolicy -> (structure)
          A cache policy.

          Id -> (string)
              The unique identifier for the cache policy.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the cache policy was last modified.

          CachePolicyConfig -> (structure)
              The cache policy configuration.

              Comment -> (string)
                 A comment to describe the cache policy. The comment cannot be
                 longer than 128 characters.

              Name -> (string)
                 A unique name to identify the cache policy.

              DefaultTTL -> (long)
                 The default amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront  sends  an-
                 other request to the origin to see if the object has been up-
                 dated. CloudFront uses this value as the objects time to live
                 (TTL) only when the origin does not send Cache-Control or Ex-
                 pires headers with the  object.  For  more  information,  see
                 Managing How Long Content Stays in an Edge Cache (Expiration)
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The default value for this field is 86400 seconds (one  day).
                 If  the  value of MinTTL is more than 86400 seconds, then the
                 default value for this field is the  same  as  the  value  of
                 MinTTL .

              MaxTTL -> (long)
                 The  maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in
                 the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another  request
                 to  the  origin to see if the object has been updated. Cloud-
                 Front uses this value only when the origin  sends  Cache-Con-
                 trol  or  Expires  headers with the object. For more informa-
                 tion, see Managing How Long Content Stays in  an  Edge  Cache
                 (Expiration) in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 The  default  value  for  this field is 31536000 seconds (one
                 year). If the value of MinTTL  or  DefaultTTL  is  more  than
                 31536000  seconds,  then  the default value for this field is
                 the same as the value of DefaultTTL .

              MinTTL -> (long)
                 The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
                 to  stay  in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends an-
                 other request to the origin to see if the object has been up-
                 dated.  For  more  information, see Managing How Long Content

              ParametersInCacheKeyAndForwardedToOrigin -> (structure)
                 The  HTTP  headers, cookies, and URL query strings to include
                 in the cache key. The values included in the  cache  key  are
                 automatically  included  in requests that CloudFront sends to
                 the origin.

                 EnableAcceptEncodingGzip -> (boolean)
                     A flag that can affect whether the  Accept-Encoding  HTTP
                     header  is  included in the cache key and included in re-
                     quests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

                     This field is related to  the  EnableAcceptEncodingBrotli
                     field.  If  one  or both of these fields is true  and the
                     viewer request includes the Accept-Encoding header,  then
                     CloudFront does the following:

                     o Normalizes  the  value  of  the viewers Accept-Encoding
                       header

                     o Includes the normalized header in the cache key

                     o Includes the normalized header in the  request  to  the
                       origin, if a request is necessary

                     If you set this value to true , and this  cache  behavior
                     also  has  an  origin request policy attached, do not in-
                     clude the Accept-Encoding header in  the  origin  request
                     policy.  CloudFront  always  includes the Accept-Encoding
                     header in origin requests when the value of this field is
                     true , so including this header in an origin request pol-
                     icy has no effect.

                     If both of these  fields  are  false  ,  then  CloudFront
                     treats  the  Accept-Encoding header the same as any other
                     HTTP header in the viewer request. By  default,  its  not
                     included  in the cache key and its not included in origin
                     requests. In this case, you can manually  add  Accept-En-
                     coding  to  the  headers  whitelist  like  any other HTTP
                     header.
