DESCRIPTION
       Updates an origin request policy configuration.

       When  you update an origin request policy configuration, all the fields
       are updated with the values provided in the request. You cannot  update
       some  fields  independent of others. To update an origin request policy
       configuration:

       o Use GetOriginRequestPolicyConfig to get the current configuration.

       o Locally modify the fields in the origin request policy  configuration
         that you want to update.

       o Call UpdateOriginRequestPolicy by providing the entire origin request
         policy configuration, including the  fields  that  you  modified  and
         those that you didnt.
