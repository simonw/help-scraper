NAME
       create-response-headers-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a response headers policy.

       A  response headers policy contains information about a set of HTTP re-
       sponse headers and their values. To create a response  headers  policy,
       you provide some metadata about the policy, and a set of configurations
       that specify the response headers.

       After you create a response headers policy, you can use its ID  to  at-
       tach  it  to  one or more cache behaviors in a CloudFront distribution.
       When its attached to a cache behavior, CloudFront adds the  headers  in
       the  policy to HTTP responses that it sends for requests that match the
       cache behavior.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
