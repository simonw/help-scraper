NAME
       get-field-level-encryption -

DESCRIPTION
       Get the field-level encryption configuration information.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-field-level-encryption
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Request the ID for the field-level encryption configuration informa-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a CloudFront field-level encryption configuration

       The  following  example gets the CloudFront field-level encryption con-
       figuration with the ID C3KM2WVD605UAY, including its ETag:

          aws cloudfront get-field-level-encryption --id C3KM2WVD605UAY

          Return the field-level encryption configuration information.

          Id -> (string)
              The configuration ID for a field-level encryption  configuration
              which  includes  a set of profiles that specify certain selected
              data fields to be encrypted by specific public keys.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last  time  the  field-level  encryption  configuration  was
              changed.

              A  complex  data  type  that includes the profile configurations
              specified for field-level encryption.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique number that ensures the request can't be replayed.

              Comment -> (string)
                 An optional comment about the configuration. The comment can-
