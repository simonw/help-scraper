NAME
       list-field-level-encryption-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       List  all  field-level encryption configurations that have been created
       in CloudFront for this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-field-level-encryption-configs
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in  your
          list  of  configurations.  The results include configurations in the
          list that occur after the marker. To get the next page  of  results,
          set  the  Marker  to  the  value  of the NextMarker from the current
          page's response (which is also the ID of the last  configuration  on
          that page).

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of field-level encryption configurations you want
          in the response body.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following example gets a list of the CloudFront field-level encryp-
       tion configurations in your AWS account:

          aws cloudfront list-field-level-encryption-configs
