GET-STREAMING-DISTRIBUTION()                      GET-STREAMING-DISTRIBUTION()



NAME
       get-streaming-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about  a  specified RTMP distribution, including the
       distribution configuration.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-streaming-distribution
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The streaming distribution's ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistribution -> (structure)
          The streaming distribution's information.

          Id -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  RTMP   distribution.   For   example:
              EGTXBD79EXAMPLE .

          ARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the distribution. For exam-
              ple:         arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFD-
              VBD632BHDS5 , where 123456789012 is your Amazon Web Services ac-
              count ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the RTMP distribution. When the status  is
              Deployed  ,  the distribution's information is propagated to all
              CloudFront edge locations.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the distribution was last modified.

          DomainName -> (string)
              The domain name that corresponds to the streaming  distribution,
              for example, s5c39gqb8ow64r.cloudfront.net .

          ActiveTrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that lists the Amazon Web Services accounts, if
              any, that you included in the TrustedSigners  complex  type  for
              this distribution. These are the accounts that you want to allow
              to create signed URLs for private content.

              The Signer complex type lists the Amazon  Web  Services  account
              number of the trusted signer or self if the signer is the Amazon
              Web Services account that created the distribution.  The  Signer
              element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs
              that are associated with the trusted signer's  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  account.  If  no KeyPairId element appears for a Signer ,
              that signer can't create signed URLs.

              For more information, see Serving Private Content through Cloud-
              Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 in the list have active CloudFront key pairs that  CloudFront
                 can  use  to  verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                 cookies. If not, this field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services accounts and the identifiers of
                 active  CloudFront  key pairs in each account that CloudFront
                 can use to verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                 cookies.

                 (structure)
                     A  list  of  Amazon  Web Services accounts and the active
                     CloudFront key pairs in each account that CloudFront  can
                     use  to  verify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                     cookies.

                     AwsAccountNumber -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services account  number  that  contains
                        active CloudFront key pairs that CloudFront can use to
                        verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed  cook-
                        ies.  If the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
                        key pairs is the same account that owns the CloudFront
                        distribution, the value of this field is self .

                     KeyPairIds -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of key pair identifiers in the list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                            (string)

          StreamingDistributionConfig -> (structure)
              The current configuration information for the RTMP distribution.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A  unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If the value of CallerReference is  new  (regardless  of  the
                 content  of  the  StreamingDistributionConfig object), Cloud-
                 Front creates a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              S3Origin -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about the Amazon  S3
                 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files
                 for distribution.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

                 OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                     The CloudFront origin access identity to  associate  with
                     the  distribution.  Use an origin access identity to con-
                     figure the distribution so that end users can only access
                     objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                     If  you want end users to be able to access objects using
                     either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3  URL,  specify
                     an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To  delete  the  origin  access identity from an existing
                     distribution, update the distribution  configuration  and
                     include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To replace the origin access identity, update the distri-
                     bution configuration and specify the  new  origin  access
                     identity.

                     to Restrict Access to Your Amazon S3 Content in the  Ama-
                     zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Aliases -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alter-
                 nate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,
                     that you want to associate with this distribution.

                     (string)

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments you want to include about the streaming  distri-
                 bution.

              Logging -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that controls whether access logs are written
                 for the streaming distribution.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to  an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable log-
                     ging when you create a streaming distribution or  if  you
                     want to disable logging for an existing streaming distri-
                     bution, specify false for Enabled  ,  and  specify  empty
                     Bucket  and Prefix elements. If you specify false for En-
                     abled but you specify values for Bucket and Prefix ,  the
                     values are automatically deleted.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for ex-
                     ample, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix  to
                     the access log filenames for this streaming distribution,
                     for example, myprefix/ . If you want to  enable  logging,
                     but  you  don't  want to specify a prefix, you still must
                     include an empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

              TrustedSigners -> (structure)
                 A complex type that specifies any  Amazon  Web  Services  ac-
                 counts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for pri-
                 vate content. If you want  the  distribution  to  use  signed
                 URLs,  include  this element; if you want the distribution to
                 use public URLs, remove this element. For  more  information,
                 see  Serving Private Content through CloudFront in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services  ac-
                     counts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify
                     the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not,
                     this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                     (string)

              PriceClass -> (string)
                 A  complex  type  that contains information about price class
                 for this streaming distribution.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Whether the streaming distribution is enabled to accept  user
                 requests for content.
