       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-streaming-distribution-with-tags
          --streaming-distribution-config-with-tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --streaming-distribution-config-with-tags (structure)
          The streaming distribution's configuration information.

          StreamingDistributionConfig -> (structure)
              A streaming distribution Configuration.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that  ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If  the  value  of  CallerReference is new (regardless of the
                 content of the  StreamingDistributionConfig  object),  Cloud-
                 Front creates a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns  a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              S3Origin -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains information about the Amazon S3
                 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files
                 for distribution.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

                 OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                     The  CloudFront  origin access identity to associate with
                     the distribution. Use an origin access identity  to  con-
                     figure the distribution so that end users can only access
                     objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                     If you want end users to be able to access objects  using
                     either  the  CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify
                     an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To delete the origin access  identity  from  an  existing
                     distribution,  update  the distribution configuration and
                     include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To replace the origin access identity, update the distri-
                     bution  configuration  and  specify the new origin access
                     identity.

              Aliases -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alter-
                 nate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                     A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases,  if  any,
                     that you want to associate with this distribution.

                     (string)

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any  comments you want to include about the streaming distri-
                 bution.

              Logging -> (structure)
                 A complex type that controls whether access logs are  written
                 for the streaming distribution.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable  log-
                     ging  when  you create a streaming distribution or if you
                     want to disable logging for an existing streaming distri-
                     bution,  specify  false  for  Enabled , and specify empty
                     Bucket and Prefix elements. If you specify false for  En-
                     abled  but you specify values for Bucket and Prefix , the
                     values are automatically deleted.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for ex-
                     ample, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An  optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to
                     the access log filenames for this streaming distribution,
                     for  example,  myprefix/ . If you want to enable logging,
                     but you don't want to specify a prefix,  you  still  must
                     include an empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

              TrustedSigners -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that  specifies any Amazon Web Services ac-
                 counts that you want to permit to create signed URLs for pri-
                 vate  content.  If  you  want  the distribution to use signed
                 URLs, include this element; if you want the  distribution  to
                 use  public  URLs, remove this element. For more information,
                 see Serving Private Content through CloudFront in the  Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This  field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services ac-
                     counts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify
                     the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not,
                     this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

                 A complex type that contains information  about  price  class
                 for this streaming distribution.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Whether  the streaming distribution is enabled to accept user
                 requests for content.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistribution -> (structure)
          The streaming distribution's information.

          Id -> (string)
              The   identifier   for   the  RTMP  distribution.  For  example:
              EGTXBD79EXAMPLE .

          ARN -> (string)
              The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the distribution.  For  exam-
              ple:         arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFD-
              VBD632BHDS5 , where 123456789012 is your Amazon Web Services ac-
              count ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The  current status of the RTMP distribution. When the status is
              Deployed , the distribution's information is propagated  to  all
              CloudFront edge locations.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the distribution was last modified.

          DomainName -> (string)
              The  domain name that corresponds to the streaming distribution,
              for example, s5c39gqb8ow64r.cloudfront.net .

          ActiveTrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A complex type that lists the Amazon Web Services  accounts,  if
              any,  that  you  included in the TrustedSigners complex type for
              this distribution. These are the accounts that you want to allow
              to create signed URLs for private content.

              The  Signer  complex  type lists the Amazon Web Services account
              number of the trusted signer or self if the signer is the Amazon
              Web  Services  account that created the distribution. The Signer
              element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs
              that  are  associated  with the trusted signer's Amazon Web Ser-
              vices account. If no KeyPairId element appears for  a  Signer  ,
              that signer can't create signed URLs.

              For more information, see Serving Private Content through Cloud-
              Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 active CloudFront key pairs in each account  that  CloudFront
                 can  use  to  verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                 cookies.

                 (structure)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services  accounts  and  the  active
                     CloudFront  key pairs in each account that CloudFront can

                        ies. If the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the
                        key pairs is the same account that owns the CloudFront
                        distribution, the value of this field is self .

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that  ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If  the  value  of  CallerReference is new (regardless of the
                 content of the  StreamingDistributionConfig  object),  Cloud-
                 Front creates a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns  a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

                     either  the  CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL, specify
                     an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To delete the origin access  identity  from  an  existing
                     distribution,  update  the distribution configuration and
                     include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To replace the origin access identity, update the distri-
