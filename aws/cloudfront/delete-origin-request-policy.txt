NAME
       delete-origin-request-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes an origin request policy.

       You cannot delete an origin request policy if its attached to any cache
       behaviors. First update your distributions to remove the origin request
       policy from all cache behaviors, then delete the origin request policy.

       To  delete an origin request policy, you must provide the policys iden-
       tifier and version. To get the identifier, you  can  use  ListOriginRe-
       questPolicies or GetOriginRequestPolicy .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-origin-request-policy
          --id <value>
          [--if-match <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The  unique  identifier  for  the origin request policy that you are
          deleting. To get the identifier, you can use  ListOriginRequestPoli-
          cies .

       --if-match (string)
          The  version of the origin request policy that you are deleting. The
          version is the origin request policys ETag value, which you can  get
          using  ListOriginRequestPolicies , GetOriginRequestPolicy , or GetO-
          riginRequestPolicyConfig .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
