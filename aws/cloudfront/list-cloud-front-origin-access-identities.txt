NAME
       list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists origin access identities.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities  is  a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query  expressions:  CloudFrontOriginAccessIden-
       tityList.Items

SYNOPSIS
            list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list CloudFront origin access identities

       The following example gets a list of the CloudFront origin access iden-
       tities (OAIs) in your AWS account:

          aws cloudfront list-cloud-front-origin-access-identities

       Output:

          {
              "CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList": {
                  "Items": [
                      {
                          "Id": "E74FTE3AEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "cd13868f797c227fbea2830611a26fe0a21ba1b826ab4bed9b7771c9aEXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Example OAI"
                      },
                      {
                          "Id": "EH1HDMBEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "1489f6f2e6faacaae7ff64c4c3e6956c24f78788abfc1718c3527c263bf7a17EXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Test OAI"
                      },
                      {
                          "Id": "E2X2C9TEXAMPLE",
                          "S3CanonicalUserId": "cbfeebb915a64749f9be546a45b3fcfd3a31c779673c13c4dd460911ae402c2EXAMPLE",
                          "Comment": "Example OAI #2"
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList -> (structure)
          The CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityList type.

          Marker -> (string)
              Use  this  when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
              your list of origin access identities. The results include iden-
              tities  in the list that occur after the marker. To get the next
              page of results, set the Marker to the value of  the  NextMarker
              from  the  current  page's response (which is also the ID of the
              last identity on that page).

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If IsTruncated is true , this element is  present  and  contains
              the  value  you can use for the Marker request parameter to con-
              tinue listing your origin access identities where they left off.

          MaxItems -> (integer)
              The maximum number of origin access identities you want  in  the
              response body.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A  flag that indicates whether more origin access identities re-
              main to be listed. If your results were truncated, you can  make
              a  follow-up pagination request using the Marker request parame-
              ter to retrieve more items in the list.

          Quantity -> (integer)
              The number of CloudFront origin access identities that were cre-
              ated by the current Amazon Web Services account.

          Items -> (list)
              A complex type that contains one CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentity-
              Summary element for each origin access identity that was created
              by the current Amazon Web Services account.

              (structure)
                 Summary  of  the information about a CloudFront origin access
                 identity.

                 Id -> (string)
                     The ID for  the  origin  access  identity.  For  example:
                     E74FTE3AJFJ256A .

                 S3CanonicalUserId -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  S3  canonical  user ID for the origin access
                     identity, which you use when  giving  the  origin  access
                     identity read permission to an object in Amazon S3.

                 Comment -> (string)
                     The  comment  for  this origin access identity, as origi-
                     nally specified when created.
