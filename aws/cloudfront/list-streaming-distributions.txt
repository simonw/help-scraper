NAME
       list-streaming-distributions -

DESCRIPTION
       List streaming distributions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-streaming-distributions  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: StreamingDistributionList.Items

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (string)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

          The StreamingDistributionList type.

          Marker -> (string)
              The value you provided for the Marker request parameter.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If IsTruncated is true , this element is  present  and  contains

              The value you provided for the MaxItems request parameter.

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A flag that indicates whether more streaming  distributions  re-
              main  to be listed. If your results were truncated, you can make

                     The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the streaming  distri-
                     bution.         For        example:        arn:aws:cloud-
                     front::123456789012:streaming-distribution/EDFD-
                     VBD632BHDS5  , where 123456789012 is your Amazon Web Ser-

                     example, d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net .

                 S3Origin -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains information about the Amazon
                     S3  bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your me-
                     dia files for distribution.

                     DomainName -> (string)

                        with  the  distribution. Use an origin access identity
                        to configure the distribution so that  end  users  can
                        only  access  objects  in  an Amazon S3 bucket through
                        CloudFront.

                        If you want end users to be able to access objects us-
                        ing  either  the  CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3 URL,
                        specify an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                        To delete the origin access identity from an  existing
                        distribution,  update  the  distribution configuration
                        and include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                        To replace the origin access identity, update the dis-
                        tribution configuration and specify the new origin ac-
                        cess identity.

                     tribution.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want  to

                     . To add, change, or remove one or more trusted  signers,
                     change Enabled to true (if it's currently false ), change
                     Quantity as applicable, and specify all  of  the  trusted
                     signers that you want to include in the updated distribu-
                     tion.
