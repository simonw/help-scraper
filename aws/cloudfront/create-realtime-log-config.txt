CREATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()                      CREATE-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIG()



NAME
       create-realtime-log-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a real-time log configuration.

       After  you  create  a real-time log configuration, you can attach it to
       one or more cache behaviors to send real-time log data to the specified
       Amazon Kinesis data stream.

       For  more information about real-time log configurations, see Real-time
       logs in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --end-points (list)
          Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where  you
          are sending real-time log data.

          (structure)
              Contains  information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream where
              you are sending real-time log data in a real-time log configura-
              tion.

              StreamType -> (string)
                 The  type  of data stream where you are sending real-time log
                 data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

              KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the  Amazon  Kinesis  data  stream
                 where you are sending real-time log data.

                 RoleARN -> (string)
                     The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access
                     Management (IAM) role that CloudFront  can  use  to  send
                     real-time log data to your Kinesis data stream.

                     For more information the IAM role, see Real-time log con-
                     figuration IAM role in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                     Guide .

                 StreamARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StreamType=string,KinesisStreamConfig={RoleARN=string,StreamARN=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "StreamType": "string",
              "KinesisStreamConfig": {
                "RoleARN": "string",
                "StreamARN": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --fields (list)
          A list of fields to include in each real-time log record.

          For more information about fields, see Real-time  log  configuration
          fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --name (string)
          A unique name to identify this real-time log configuration.

       --sampling-rate (long)
          The sampling rate for this real-time log configuration. The sampling
          rate determines the percentage of viewer requests  that  are  repre-
          sented  in  the  real-time log data. You must provide an integer be-
          tween 1 and 100, inclusive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          SamplingRate -> (long)
              The sampling rate for this real-time log configuration. The sam-
              pling rate determines the percentage of viewer requests that are
              represented in the real-time log data. The sampling rate  is  an
              integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

                 Contains  information  about  the  Amazon Kinesis data stream
                 where you are sending real-time log data in a  real-time  log
                 configuration.

                 StreamType -> (string)
                     The  type  of data stream where you are sending real-time
                     log data. The only valid value is Kinesis .

                 KinesisStreamConfig -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the Amazon Kinesis data stream
                     where you are sending real-time log data.

                     RoleARN -> (string)
                        The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Ac-
                        cess Management (IAM) role that CloudFront can use  to
                        send real-time log data to your Kinesis data stream.

                        For  more  information the IAM role, see Real-time log
                        configuration IAM role in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                        The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the Kinesis data
                        stream where you are sending real-time log data.

          Fields -> (list)
              A list of fields that are included in each real-time log record.
              In an API response, the fields are provided in the same order in
              which they are sent to the Amazon Kinesis data stream.

              For more information about fields, see Real-time log  configura-
              tion fields in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .
