OPTIONS
       --streaming-distribution-config (structure)
          The streaming distribution's configuration information.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique value (for example, a  date-time  stamp)  that  ensures
              that the request can't be replayed.

              If  the  value of CallerReference is new (regardless of the con-
              tent of the StreamingDistributionConfig object), CloudFront cre-
              ates a new distribution.

              If  CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a previ-
              ous request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a  Dis-
              tributionAlreadyExists error.

          S3Origin -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  contains information about the Amazon S3
              bucket from which you want CloudFront to get  your  media  files
              for distribution.

              DomainName -> (string)
                 The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

              OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                 The  CloudFront  origin access identity to associate with the
                 distribution. Use an origin access identity to configure  the
                 distribution  so that end users can only access objects in an
                 Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                 If you want end users to be able to access objects using  ei-
                 ther  the  CloudFront  URL  or  the Amazon S3 URL, specify an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To delete the origin access identity from an existing distri-
                 bution,  update the distribution configuration and include an
                 empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                 To replace the origin access identity, update  the  distribu-
                 tion  configuration  and  specify the new origin access iden-
                 tity.

                 For more information, see Using an Origin Access Identity  to
                 Restrict  Access  to  Your  Amazon  S3  Content in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Aliases -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate
              domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The  number  of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to asso-
                 ciate with this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,  that
                 you want to associate with this distribution.

                 (string)

          Comment -> (string)
              Any  comments  you want to include about the streaming distribu-
              tion.

          Logging -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for
              the streaming distribution.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies  whether you want CloudFront to save access logs to
                 an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when
                 you create a streaming distribution or if you want to disable
                 logging for an existing streaming distribution, specify false
                 for  Enabled  , and specify empty Bucket and Prefix elements.
                 If you specify false for Enabled but you specify  values  for
                 Bucket and Prefix , the values are automatically deleted.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for exam-
                 ple, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to  the
                 access log filenames for this streaming distribution, for ex-
                 ample, myprefix/ . If you want to  enable  logging,  but  you
                 don't  want  to  specify  a prefix, you still must include an
                 empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

          TrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A complex type that specifies any Amazon Web  Services  accounts
              that  you  want to permit to create signed URLs for private con-
              tent. If you want the distribution to use signed  URLs,  include
              this  element;  if you want the distribution to use public URLs,
              remove this element. For more information, see  Serving  Private
              Content  through  CloudFront  in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
              Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify the signa-
                 tures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not,  this  field
                 is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                 (string)

          PriceClass -> (string)
              A  complex  type that contains information about price class for
              this streaming distribution.

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              Whether the streaming distribution is enabled to accept user re-
              quests for content.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       StreamingDistribution -> (structure)
          The streaming distribution's information.

          Id -> (string)
              The  identifier  for  the  RTMP   distribution.   For   example:
              EGTXBD79EXAMPLE .

          ARN -> (string)
              The  ARN  (Amazon Resource Name) for the distribution. For exam-
              ple:         arn:aws:cloudfront::123456789012:distribution/EDFD-
              VBD632BHDS5 , where 123456789012 is your Amazon Web Services ac-
              count ID.

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the RTMP distribution. When the status  is
              Deployed  ,  the distribution's information is propagated to all
              CloudFront edge locations.

          LastModifiedTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time that the distribution was last modified.

          DomainName -> (string)
              The domain name that corresponds to the streaming  distribution,

          ActiveTrustedSigners -> (structure)
              A  complex  type that lists the Amazon Web Services accounts, if
              any, that you included in the TrustedSigners  complex  type  for
              this distribution. These are the accounts that you want to allow
              to create signed URLs for private content.

              The Signer complex type lists the Amazon  Web  Services  account
              number of the trusted signer or self if the signer is the Amazon
              Web Services account that created the distribution.  The  Signer
              element also includes the IDs of any active CloudFront key pairs
              that are associated with the trusted signer's  Amazon  Web  Ser-
              vices  account.  If  no KeyPairId element appears for a Signer ,
              that signer can't create signed URLs.

                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of Amazon Web Services accounts and the identifiers of
                 active  CloudFront  key pairs in each account that CloudFront
                 can use to verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                 cookies.

                 (structure)
                     A  list  of  Amazon  Web Services accounts and the active
                     CloudFront key pairs in each account that CloudFront  can
                     use  to  verify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed
                     cookies.

                     AwsAccountNumber -> (string)
                        An Amazon Web Services account  number  that  contains
                        active CloudFront key pairs that CloudFront can use to
                        verify the signatures of signed URLs and signed  cook-
                        ies.  If the Amazon Web Services account that owns the
                        key pairs is the same account that owns the CloudFront
                        distribution, the value of this field is self .

                     KeyPairIds -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

          StreamingDistributionConfig -> (structure)
              The current configuration information for the RTMP distribution.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A  unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If the value of CallerReference is  new  (regardless  of  the
                 content  of  the  StreamingDistributionConfig object), Cloud-
                 Front creates a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              S3Origin -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about the Amazon  S3
                 bucket from which you want CloudFront to get your media files
                 for distribution.

                 DomainName -> (string)
                     The DNS name of the Amazon S3 origin.

                 OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                     The CloudFront origin access identity to  associate  with
                     the  distribution.  Use an origin access identity to con-
                     figure the distribution so that end users can only access
                     objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through CloudFront.

                     If  you want end users to be able to access objects using
                     either the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3  URL,  specify
                     an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To  delete  the  origin  access identity from an existing
                     distribution, update the distribution  configuration  and
                     include an empty OriginAccessIdentity element.

                     To replace the origin access identity, update the distri-
                     bution configuration and specify the  new  origin  access
                     identity.

              Aliases -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alter-
                 nate domain names), if any, for this streaming distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,
                     that you want to associate with this distribution.

                     (string)

              Comment -> (string)
                 Any comments you want to include about the streaming  distri-
                 bution.

              Logging -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that controls whether access logs are written
                 for the streaming distribution.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to  an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable log-
                     ging when you create a streaming distribution or  if  you
                     want to disable logging for an existing streaming distri-
                     bution, specify false for Enabled  ,  and  specify  empty
                     Bucket  and Prefix elements. If you specify false for En-
                     abled but you specify values for Bucket and Prefix ,  the
                     values are automatically deleted.

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for ex-
                     ample, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix  to
                     the access log filenames for this streaming distribution,
                     for example, myprefix/ . If you want to  enable  logging,
