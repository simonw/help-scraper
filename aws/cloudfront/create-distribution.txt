CREATE-DISTRIBUTION()                                    CREATE-DISTRIBUTION()



NAME
       create-distribution -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new web distribution. You create a CloudFront distribution to
       tell CloudFront where you want content to be delivered  from,  and  the
       details about how to track and manage content delivery. Send a POST re-
       quest to the /*CloudFront API version* /distribution  /distribution  ID
       resource.

       WARNING:
          When  you update a distribution, there are more required fields than
          when you create a distribution. When you update your distribution by
          using UpdateDistribution , follow the steps included in the documen-
          tation to get the current configuration and then make your  updates.
          This helps to make sure that you include all of the required fields.
          To view a summary, see Required Fields for Create  Distribution  and
          Update Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

OPTIONS
       --distribution-config (structure)
          The distribution's configuration information.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A  unique  value  (for  example, a date-time stamp) that ensures
              that the request can't be replayed.

              If the value of CallerReference is new (regardless of  the  con-
              tent of the DistributionConfig object), CloudFront creates a new
              distribution.

              If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a  previ-
              ous  request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns a Dis-
              tributionAlreadyExists error.

          Aliases -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alternate
              domain names), if any, for this distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The  number  of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to asso-
                 ciate with this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A complex type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,  that
                 you want to associate with this distribution.

                 (string)

          DefaultRootObject -> (string)
              The  object that you want CloudFront to request from your origin
              (for example, index.html ) when a viewer requests the  root  URL
              for  your  distribution  (http://www.example.com ) instead of an
              object in your distribution  (http://www.example.com/product-de-
              scription.html ). Specifying a default root object avoids expos-
              ing the contents of your distribution.

              Specify only the object name, for example,  index.html  .  Don't
              add a / before the object name.

              If you don't want to specify a default root object when you cre-
              ate a distribution, include an empty DefaultRootObject element.

              To delete the default root object from an existing distribution,
              update  the  distribution configuration and include an empty De-
              faultRootObject element.

              To replace the default root object, update the distribution con-
              figuration and specify the new object.

              For more information about the default root object, see Creating
              a Default Root Object in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Origins -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about origins for  this
              distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of origins for this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of origins.

                 (structure)
                     An origin.

                     An  origin  is  the location where content is stored, and
                     from which CloudFront gets content to serve  to  viewers.
                     To specify an origin:

                     o Use  S3OriginConfig to specify an Amazon S3 bucket that
                       is not configured with static website hosting.

                     o Use CustomOriginConfig to specify all  other  kinds  of
                       origins, including:

                       o An  Amazon  S3  bucket that is configured with static
                         website hosting

                       o An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                       o An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                       o An AWS Elemental MediaStore container

                       o Any other HTTP server, running on an Amazon  EC2  in-
                         stance or any other kind of host

                     For  the  current  maximum number of origins that you can
                     specify per distribution, see General Quotas on Web  Dis-
                     tributions in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide (quo-
                     tas were formerly referred to as limits).

                     Id -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be
                        unique within the distribution.

                        Use  this  value  to  specify  the TargetOriginId in a
                        CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior .

                     DomainName -> (string)
                        The domain name for the origin.

                        For more information, see Origin Domain  Name  in  the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     OriginPath -> (string)
                        An optional path that CloudFront appends to the origin
                        domain name when CloudFront requests content from  the
                        origin.

                        For  more  information,  see Origin Path in the Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CustomHeaders -> (structure)
                        A list of HTTP header names and values that CloudFront
                        adds to the requests that it sends to the origin.

                        For  more  information,  see  Adding Custom Headers to
                        Origin Requests in  the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                        Guide .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  custom  headers, if any, for this
                            distribution.

                        Items -> (list)
                               Optional : A list that contains one  OriginCus-
                               tomHeader  element  for each custom header that
                               you want CloudFront to forward to  the  origin.
                               If Quantity is 0 , omit Items .

                            (structure)
                               A  complex  type  that  contains HeaderName and
                               HeaderValue elements, if any, for this  distri-
                               bution.

                               HeaderName -> (string)
                                   The  name  of a header that you want Cloud-
                                   Front to send to your origin. For more  in-
                                   formation,  see  Adding  Custom  Headers to
                                   Origin Requests in  the  Amazon  CloudFront
                                   Developer Guide .

                               HeaderValue -> (string)
                                   The value for the header that you specified
                                   in the HeaderName field.

                     S3OriginConfig -> (structure)
                        Use this type to specify an origin that is  an  Amazon
                        S3  bucket  that is not configured with static website
                        hosting. To specify any other type of origin,  includ-
                        ing an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static
                        website hosting, use the CustomOriginConfig  type  in-
                        stead.

                        OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                            The CloudFront origin access identity to associate
                            with the origin. Use an origin access identity  to
                            configure  the origin so that viewers can only ac-
                            cess objects in an Amazon S3 bucket through Cloud-
                            Front. The format of the value is:

                            origin-access-identity/cloudfront/ID-of-origin-ac-
                            cess-identity

                            where `` ID-of-origin-access-identity  ``  is  the
                            value  that  CloudFront returned in the ID element
                            when you created the origin access identity.

                            If you want viewers to be able to  access  objects
                            using  either  the CloudFront URL or the Amazon S3
                            URL, specify an  empty  OriginAccessIdentity  ele-
                            ment.

                            To  delete  the origin access identity from an ex-
                            isting distribution, update the distribution  con-
                            figuration  and include an empty OriginAccessIden-
                            tity element.

                            To replace the origin access identity, update  the
                            distribution  configuration  and  specify  the new
                            origin access identity.

                            For more information about the origin access iden-
                            tity,  see  Serving Private Content through Cloud-
                            Front in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     CustomOriginConfig -> (structure)
                        Use this type to specify an origin that is not an Ama-
                        zon  S3  bucket,  with one exception. If the Amazon S3
                        bucket is configured with static website hosting,  use
                        this  type.  If the Amazon S3 bucket is not configured
                        with static website hosting,  use  the  S3OriginConfig
                        type instead.

                        HTTPPort -> (integer)
                            The  HTTP  port that CloudFront uses to connect to
                            the origin. Specify the HTTP port that the  origin
                            listens on.

                        HTTPSPort -> (integer)
                            The  HTTPS port that CloudFront uses to connect to
                            the origin. Specify the HTTPS port that the origin
                            listens on.

                        OriginProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                            Specifies the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) that Cloud-
                            Front uses to connect to the origin. Valid  values
                            are:

                            o http-only   CloudFront  always uses HTTP to con-
                              nect to the origin.

                            o match-viewer  CloudFront connects to the  origin
                              using  the same protocol that the viewer used to
                              connect to CloudFront.

                            o https-only  CloudFront always uses HTTPS to con-
                              nect to the origin.

                        OriginSslProtocols -> (structure)
                            Specifies the minimum SSL/TLS protocol that Cloud-
                            Front uses when connecting  to  your  origin  over
                            HTTPS.  Valid  values  include  SSLv3  ,  TLSv1  ,
                            TLSv1.1 , and TLSv1.2 .

                            For more information, see Minimum Origin SSL  Pro-
                            tocol in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The  number  of SSL/TLS protocols that you want
                               to allow CloudFront to use when establishing an
                               HTTPS connection with this origin.

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  list that contains allowed SSL/TLS protocols
                               for this distribution.

                               (string)

                        OriginReadTimeout -> (integer)
                            Specifies how long, in seconds,  CloudFront  waits
                            for a response from the origin. This is also known
                            as the origin response timeout . The minimum time-
                            out  is  1  second, the maximum is 60 seconds, and
                            the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is  30
                            seconds.

                            For  more information, see Origin Response Timeout
                            in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        OriginKeepaliveTimeout -> (integer)
                            Specifies how long, in  seconds,  CloudFront  per-
                            sists  its  connection  to the origin. The minimum
                            timeout is 1 second, the maximum  is  60  seconds,
                            and the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is
                            5 seconds.

                            For more information, see Origin Keep-alive  Time-
                            out in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     ConnectionAttempts -> (integer)
                        The  number  of times that CloudFront attempts to con-
                        nect to the origin. The minimum number is 1, the maxi-
                        mum  is 3, and the default (if you dont specify other-
                        wise) is 3.

                        For a custom origin (including  an  Amazon  S3  bucket
                        thats  configured  with  static website hosting), this
                        value also specifies the number of times  that  Cloud-
                        Front  attempts  to get a response from the origin, in
                        the case of an Origin Response Timeout .

                        For more information, see Origin  Connection  Attempts
                        in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     ConnectionTimeout -> (integer)
                        The  number of seconds that CloudFront waits when try-
                        ing to establish a connection to the origin. The mini-
                        mum  timeout  is  1 second, the maximum is 10 seconds,
                        and the default (if you dont specify otherwise) is  10
                        seconds.

                        the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     OriginShield -> (structure)
                        CloudFront Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can help
                        reduce the load on your origin.

                        For  more  information, see Using Origin Shield in the
                        Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            A flag that specifies whether Origin Shield is en-
                            abled.

                            When  its  enabled, CloudFront routes all requests
                            through Origin Shield, which can help protect your
                            origin.  When  its disabled, CloudFront might send
                            requests directly to  your  origin  from  multiple
                            edge locations or regional edge caches.

                        OriginShieldRegion -> (string)
                            The Amazon Web Services Region for Origin Shield.

                            Specify  the  Amazon  Web Services Region that has
                            the lowest latency to your origin.  To  specify  a
                            region,  use the region code, not the region name.
                            For example, specify the US East (Ohio) region  as
                            us-east-2 .

                            When you enable CloudFront Origin Shield, you must
                            specify the Amazon Web Services Region for  Origin
                            Shield.  For  the  list of Amazon Web Services Re-
                            gions that you can specify, and for help  choosing
                            the  best Region for your origin, see Choosing the
                            Amazon Web Services Region for  Origin  Shield  in
                            the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          OriginGroups -> (structure)
              A complex type that contains information about origin groups for
              this distribution.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of origin groups.

              Items -> (list)
                 The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                 (structure)
                     An origin group includes two origins  (a  primary  origin
                     and a second origin to failover to) and a failover crite-
                     ria that you specify. You create an origin group to  sup-
                     port  origin  failover  in CloudFront. When you create or
                     update a distribution, you can specifiy the origin  group
                     instead  of a single origin, and CloudFront will failover
                     from the primary origin to the second  origin  under  the
                     failover conditions that you've chosen.

                     Id -> (string)
                        The origin group's ID.

                        A  complex  type  that  contains information about the
                        failover criteria for an origin group.

                        StatusCodes -> (structure)
                            The status codes that, when returned from the pri-
                            mary  origin,  will trigger CloudFront to failover
                            to the second origin.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of status codes.

                            Items -> (list)
                               The items (status codes) for an origin group.

                               (integer)

                     Members -> (structure)
                        A complex type that  contains  information  about  the
                        origins in an origin group.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of origins in an origin group.

                        Items -> (list)
                            Items (origins) in an origin group.

                            (structure)
                               An origin in an origin group.

                               OriginId -> (string)
                                   The ID for an origin in an origin group.

          DefaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
              A  complex type that describes the default cache behavior if you
              don't specify a CacheBehavior element or if  files  don't  match
              any  of the values of PathPattern in CacheBehavior elements. You
              must create exactly one default cache behavior.

              TargetOriginId -> (string)
                 The value of ID for the origin that you  want  CloudFront  to
                 route requests to when they use the default cache behavior.

              TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                 WARNING:
                     We  recommend  using TrustedKeyGroups instead of Trusted-
                     Signers .

                 A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose  public  keys
                 CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 When  a  cache  behavior contains trusted signers, CloudFront
                 requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests  that
                 match  the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed
                 with the private key of a CloudFront key pair  in  a  trusted
                 signers Amazon Web Services account. The signed URL or cookie
                 contains information about which public key CloudFront should
                 use  to  verify  the  signature.  For  more  information, see
                 Serving private content in the  Amazon  CloudFront  Developer
                 Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This  field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services ac-
                     counts have public keys that CloudFront can use to verify
                     the signatures of signed URLs and signed cookies. If not,
                     this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                     (string)

              TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                 A list of key groups that  CloudFront  can  use  to  validate
                 signed URLs or signed cookies.

                 When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, CloudFront
                 requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all requests  that
                 match  the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies must be signed
                 with a private key whose corresponding public key is  in  the
                 key  group.  The  signed  URL  or cookie contains information
                 about which public key CloudFront should use  to  verify  the
                 signature.  For more information, see Serving private content
                 in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     This field is true if any of the key groups in  the  list
                     have  public  keys  that CloudFront can use to verify the
                     signatures of signed URLs and  signed  cookies.  If  not,
                     this field is false .

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of key groups in the list.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of key groups identifiers.

                     (string)

              ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                 The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files in the
                 origin specified by TargetOriginId when a request matches the
                 path  pattern  in PathPattern . You can specify the following
                 options:

                 o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                 o redirect-to-https : If a viewer submits  an  HTTP  request,
                   CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301 (Moved Perma-
                   nently) to the viewer along with the HTTPS URL. The  viewer
                   then resubmits the request using the new URL.

                 o https-only  : If a viewer sends an HTTP request, CloudFront
                   returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).

                 For more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol,  see
                 Requiring  HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an object
                     that  was fetched from the origin using HTTPS is never to
                     use any other protocol to fetch the object. If  you  have
                     recently  changed  from  HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that
                     you clear your objects cache because cached  objects  are
                     protocol  agnostic. That means that an edge location will
                     return an object from the cache regardless of whether the
                     current request protocol matches the protocol used previ-
                     ously. For more information, see Managing  Cache  Expira-
                     tion in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that controls which HTTP methods CloudFront
                 processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket or your  cus-
                 tom origin. There are three choices:

                 o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                 o CloudFront forwards only GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests.

                 o CloudFront  forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST ,
                   and DELETE requests.

                 If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict access
                 to  your  Amazon  S3 bucket or to your custom origin so users
                 can't perform operations that you don't want them to. For ex-
                 ample, you might not want users to have permissions to delete
                 objects from your origin.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of HTTP methods that you  want  CloudFront  to
                     forward  to  your origin. Valid values are 2 (for GET and
                     HEAD requests), 3 (for GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS requests)
                     and  7  (for  GET,  HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST , and
                     DELETE requests).

                 Items -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains the HTTP  methods  that  you
                     want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                     (string)

                 CachedMethods -> (structure)
                     A  complex  type  that controls whether CloudFront caches
                     the response to requests using the specified  HTTP  meth-
                     ods. There are two choices:

                     o CloudFront caches responses to GET and HEAD requests.

                     o CloudFront caches responses to GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                       requests.

                     If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3  Origin,
                     you  may  need  to forward Access-Control-Request-Method,
                     Access-Control-Request-Headers, and  Origin  headers  for
                     the responses to be cached correctly.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The  number  of HTTP methods for which you want Cloud-
                        Front to cache responses.  Valid  values  are  2  (for
                        caching responses to GET and HEAD requests) and 3 (for
                        caching responses to GET ,  HEAD  ,  and  OPTIONS  re-
                        quests).

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you
                        want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                        (string)

              SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether you want to distribute media files  in  the
                 Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming  format using the origin that is
                 associated with this cache behavior. If so, specify true ; if
                 not,  specify false . If you specify true for SmoothStreaming
                 , you can still distribute other content using this cache be-
                 havior if the content matches the value of PathPattern .

              Compress -> (boolean)
                 Whether you want CloudFront to automatically compress certain
                 files for this cache behavior. If so, specify true ; if  not,
                 specify  false . For more information, see Serving Compressed
                 Files in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains zero or more  Lambda@Edge  func-
                 tion associations for a cache behavior.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The  number of Lambda@Edge function associations for this
                     cache behavior.

                 Items -> (list)
                        Optional : A complex type  that  contains  LambdaFunc-
                        tionAssociation  items  for  this  cache  behavior. If
                        Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                     (structure)
                        A complex type that contains  a  Lambda@Edge  function
                        association.

                        LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                            The  ARN  of  the  Lambda@Edge  function. You must
                            specify the ARN of a function version;  you  can't
                            specify an alias or $LATEST.

                        EventType -> (string)
                            Specifies   the   event   type   that  triggers  a
                            Lambda@Edge function invocation. You  can  specify
                            the following values:

                            o viewer-request  :  The  function  executes  when
                              CloudFront receives a request from a viewer  and
                              before  it  checks  to see whether the requested
                              object is in the edge cache.

                            o origin-request : The function executes only when
                              CloudFront  sends a request to your origin. When
                              the requested object is in the edge  cache,  the
                              function doesn't execute.

                            o origin-response  :  The  function executes after
                              CloudFront receives a response from  the  origin
                              and before it caches the object in the response.
                              When the requested object is in the edge  cache,
                              the function doesn't execute.

                            o viewer-response  :  The function executes before
                              CloudFront returns the requested object  to  the
                              viewer.  The  function  executes  regardless  of
                              whether the  object  was  already  in  the  edge
                              cache. If the origin returns an HTTP status code
                              other than HTTP 200 (OK), the  function  doesn't
                              execute.

                        IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                            A  flag that allows a Lambda@Edge function to have

              ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                 This  field  is deprecated. We recommend that you use a cache
                 policy or an origin request policy instead of this field. For
                 more  information,  see  Working  with policies in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If you want to include values in the cache key, use  a  cache

                 If you want to send values to the origin but not include them
                 in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For more  in-

                 A complex type that specifies how  CloudFront  handles  query
                 strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                 QueryString -> (boolean)
                     This  field  is  deprecated.  We recommend that you use a
                     cache policy or an origin request policy instead of  this
                     field.

                     If  you  want  to include query strings in the cache key,
                     use a cache policy. For more  information,  see  Creating
                     cache policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If  you  want to send query strings to the origin but not
                     include them in the cache key, use an origin request pol-
                     icy.  For  more  information, see Creating origin request
                     policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     Indicates whether you want CloudFront  to  forward  query
                     strings  to the origin that is associated with this cache
                     behavior and cache based on the query string  parameters.
                     CloudFront  behavior  depends on the value of QueryString
                     and on the  values  that  you  specify  for  QueryString-
                     CacheKeys , if any:

                     If you specify true for QueryString and you don't specify
                     any values for QueryStringCacheKeys , CloudFront forwards
                     all  query  string  parameters  to  the origin and caches
                     based on all query string parameters.  Depending  on  how
                     many  query  string  parameters and values you have, this
                     can adversely affect performance because CloudFront  must
                     forward more requests to the origin.

                     If  you  specify true for QueryString and you specify one
                     or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys , CloudFront for-
                     wards  all  query string parameters to the origin, but it
                     only caches based on the query string parameters that you
                     specify.

                     If you specify false for QueryString , CloudFront doesn't
                     forward any query string parameters to  the  origin,  and
                     doesn't cache based on query string parameters.

                 Cookies -> (structure)
                     This  field  is  deprecated.  We recommend that you use a
                     cache policy or an origin request policy instead of  this
                     field.

                     If  you  want  to include cookies in the cache key, use a
                     cache policy. For more information,  see  Creating  cache
                     policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     If you want to send cookies to the origin but not include
                     them in the cache key, use an origin request policy.  For
                     more information, see Creating origin request policies in
                     the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     Forward -> (string)
                        This field is deprecated. We recommend that you use  a
                        cache  policy  or  an origin request policy instead of
                        this field.

                        If you want to include cookies in the cache key, use a

                        clude  them  in the cache key, use origin request pol-
                        icy. For more information, see Creating origin request
                        policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Specifies  which  cookies to forward to the origin for
                        this cache behavior: all, none, or the list of cookies
                        specified in the WhitelistedNames complex type.

                        Amazon  S3 doesn't process cookies. When the cache be-
                        havior is forwarding requests to an Amazon S3  origin,
                        specify none for the Forward element.

                     WhitelistedNames -> (structure)
                        This  field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a

                        Required  if  you  specify  whitelist for the value of
                        Forward . A complex type that specifies how many  dif-
                        ferent  cookies  you want CloudFront to forward to the
                        origin for this cache behavior and,  if  you  want  to
                        forward selected cookies, the names of those cookies.

                        If  you specify all or none for the value of Forward ,
                        omit WhitelistedNames . If you  change  the  value  of
                        Forward  from  whitelist  to all or none and you don't
                        delete the WhitelistedNames element and its child ele-
                        ments, CloudFront deletes them automatically.

                        For  the  current  limit on the number of cookie names
                        that you can whitelist for each  cache  behavior,  see

          CacheBehaviors -> (structure)
              A  complex  type  that  contains zero or more CacheBehavior ele-
              ments.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of cache behaviors for this distribution.

              Items -> (list)
                 Optional: A complex type that contains  cache  behaviors  for
                 this distribution. If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                 (structure)
                     A  complex  type  that describes how CloudFront processes
                     requests.

                     You must create at least as many cache behaviors (includ-
                     ing  the  default  cache behavior) as you have origins if
                     you want CloudFront to serve objects from all of the ori-
                     gins.  Each  cache behavior specifies the one origin from
                     which you want CloudFront to get objects. If you have two
                     origins  and only the default cache behavior, the default
                     cache behavior will cause CloudFront to get objects  from
                     one of the origins, but the other origin is never used.

                     For  the  current  quota (formerly known as limit) on the
                     number of cache behaviors that you can add to a distribu-
                     tion, see Quotas in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide
                     .

                     If you dont want to specify any cache behaviors,  include
                     only  an  empty  CacheBehaviors  element. Dont include an
                     empty CacheBehavior element because this is invalid.

                     To delete all cache behaviors in  an  existing  distribu-
                     tion,  update  the distribution configuration and include
                     only an empty CacheBehaviors element.

                     To add, change, or remove one or  more  cache  behaviors,
                     update  the distribution configuration and specify all of
                     the cache behaviors that you want to include in  the  up-
                     dated distribution.

                     For more information about cache behaviors, see Cache Be-
                     havior Settings in the Amazon CloudFront Developer  Guide
                     .

                     PathPattern -> (string)
                        The  pattern  (for example, images/*.jpg ) that speci-
                        fies which requests to apply  the  behavior  to.  When
                        CloudFront  receives  a  viewer request, the requested
                        path is compared with path patterns in  the  order  in
                        which cache behaviors are listed in the distribution.

                        NOTE:
                            You can optionally include a slash (/ ) at the be-
                            ginning of the path  pattern.  For  example,  /im-
                            ages/*.jpg  . CloudFront behavior is the same with
                            or without the leading / .

                        The path pattern for the default cache behavior  is  *
                        and  cannot  be  changed. If the request for an object
                        does not match the path pattern for any  cache  behav-
                        iors,  CloudFront  applies the behavior in the default
                        cache behavior.

                        For more information, see Path Pattern in  the  Amazon
                        CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     TargetOriginId -> (string)
                        The  value  of  ID for the origin that you want Cloud-
                        Front to route requests to when they match this  cache
                        behavior.

                     TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                        WARNING:
                            We  recommend  using  TrustedKeyGroups  instead of
                            TrustedSigners .

                        A list of Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public
                        keys  CloudFront  can  use  to validate signed URLs or
                        signed cookies.

                        When a cache behavior contains trusted signers, Cloud-
                        Front  requires  signed URLs or signed cookies for all
                        requests that match the cache behavior.  The  URLs  or
                        cookies  must  be  signed  with  the  private key of a
                        CloudFront key pair in the trusted signers Amazon  Web
                        Services  account.  The  signed URL or cookie contains
                        information about which public key  CloudFront  should
                        use to verify the signature. For more information, see

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            This  field  is true if any of the Amazon Web Ser-
                            vices accounts have public  keys  that  CloudFront
                            can  use  to  verify the signatures of signed URLs
                            and signed cookies. If not, this field is false .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in  the
                            list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                            (string)

                     TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                        A  list of key groups that CloudFront can use to vali-
                        date signed URLs or signed cookies.

                        When a cache behavior  contains  trusted  key  groups,
                        CloudFront  requires signed URLs or signed cookies for
                        all requests that match the cache behavior.  The  URLs
                        or  cookies  must  be  signed with a private key whose
                        corresponding public key is  in  the  key  group.  The
                        signed  URL or cookie contains information about which
                        public key CloudFront should use to verify the  signa-
                        ture.  For  more information, see Serving private con-
                        tent in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        Enabled -> (boolean)
                            This field is true if any of the key groups in the
                            list  have  public keys that CloudFront can use to
                            verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                            cookies. If not, this field is false .

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of key groups in the list.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of key groups identifiers.

                            (string)

                     ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                        The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files
                        in the origin specified by TargetOriginId when  a  re-
                        quest  matches  the  path pattern in PathPattern . You
                        can specify the following options:

                        o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                        o redirect-to-https : If a viewer submits an HTTP  re-
                          quest, CloudFront returns an HTTP status code of 301
                          (Moved Permanently) to the  viewer  along  with  the
                          HTTPS URL. The viewer then resubmits the request us-
                          ing the new URL.

                        o https-only : If a  viewer  sends  an  HTTP  request,
                          CloudFront  returns an HTTP status code of 403 (For-
                          bidden).

                        NOTE:
                            The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an
                            object  that  was  fetched  from  the origin using
                            HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to  fetch
                            the object. If you have recently changed from HTTP
                            to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear your objects
                            cache  because  cached objects are protocol agnos-
                            tic. That means that an edge location will  return
                            an object from the cache regardless of whether the
                            current request protocol matches the protocol used
                            previously.  For  more  information,  see Managing

                     AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls which HTTP methods Cloud-
                        Front processes and forwards to your Amazon S3  bucket
                        or your custom origin. There are three choices:

                        o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                        o CloudFront  forwards  only  GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                          requests.

                        o CloudFront forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT,  PATCH,
                          POST , and DELETE requests.

                        If you pick the third choice, you may need to restrict
                        access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom ori-
                        gin  so  users can't perform operations that you don't
                        want them to. For example, you might not want users to
                        have permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  HTTP methods that you want Cloud-
                            Front to forward to your origin. Valid values  are
                            2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3 (for GET , HEAD ,
                            and OPTIONS requests) and 7 (for  GET,  HEAD,  OP-
                            TIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST , and DELETE requests).

                        Items -> (list)
                            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that
                            you want CloudFront to process and forward to your
                            origin.

                            (string)

                        CachedMethods -> (structure)
                            A  complex  type  that controls whether CloudFront
                            caches the response to requests using  the  speci-
                            fied HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                            o CloudFront  caches responses to GET and HEAD re-
                              quests.

                            o CloudFront caches responses to GET , HEAD ,  and
                              OPTIONS requests.

                            If  you  pick the second choice for your Amazon S3
                            Origin, you may need to forward Access-Control-Re-
                            quest-Method,  Access-Control-Request-Headers, and
                            Origin headers for the responses to be cached cor-
                            rectly.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The  number  of HTTP methods for which you want
                               CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are
                               2  (for  caching  responses to GET and HEAD re-
                               quests) and 3 (for caching responses to  GET  ,
                               HEAD , and OPTIONS requests).

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  complex  type that contains the HTTP methods
                               that you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                               (string)

                     SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether you want to distribute  media  files
                        in  the  Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming format using the
                        origin that is associated with this cache behavior. If
                        so,  specify  true  ;  if  not, specify false . If you
                        specify true for SmoothStreaming , you can still  dis-
                        tribute other content using this cache behavior if the
                        content matches the value of PathPattern .

                     Compress -> (boolean)
                        Whether you want CloudFront to automatically  compress
                        certain  files for this cache behavior. If so, specify
                        true; if not, specify false. For more information, see

                     LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                        A complex type that contains zero or more  Lambda@Edge
                        function associations for a cache behavior.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  Lambda@Edge function associations
                            for this cache behavior.

                        Items -> (list)
                               Optional : A complex type that contains Lambda-

                               A complex  type  that  contains  a  Lambda@Edge
                               function association.

                               LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                                   The  ARN  of  the Lambda@Edge function. You
                                   must specify the ARN of a function version;
                                   you can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                               EventType -> (string)
                                   Specifies  the  event  type that triggers a
                                   Lambda@Edge function  invocation.  You  can
                                   specify the following values:

                                   o viewer-request  :  The  function executes
                                     when CloudFront receives a request from a
                                     viewer   and  before  it  checks  to  see
                                     whether the requested object  is  in  the
                                     edge cache.

                                   o origin-request  :  The  function executes
                                     only when CloudFront sends a  request  to
                                     your origin. When the requested object is
                                     in the edge cache, the  function  doesn't
                                     execute.

                                   o origin-response  :  The function executes
                                     after CloudFront receives a response from
                                     the  origin  and before it caches the ob-
                                     ject in the response. When the  requested
                                     object is in the edge cache, the function
                                     doesn't execute.

                                   o viewer-response : The  function  executes
                                     before  CloudFront  returns the requested
                                     object to the viewer. The  function  exe-
                                     cutes  regardless  of  whether the object
                                     was already in the  edge  cache.  If  the
                                     origin  returns an HTTP status code other
                                     than HTTP 200 (OK), the function  doesn't
                                     execute.

                        A complex type that specifies how  CloudFront  handles
                        query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                        QueryString -> (boolean)
                            This  field  is  deprecated. We recommend that you
                            use a cache policy or an origin request policy in-
                            stead of this field.

                            If  you want to include query strings in the cache
                            key, use a cache policy. For more information, see
                            Creating  cache  policies in the Amazon CloudFront
                            Developer Guide .

                            If you want to send query strings  to  the  origin
                            but not include them in the cache key, use an ori-
                            gin request  policy.  For  more  information,  see
                            Creating  origin  request  policies  in the Amazon

                            Indicates whether you want CloudFront  to  forward
                            query  strings  to  the  origin that is associated
                            with this cache behavior and cache  based  on  the
                            query  string  parameters. CloudFront behavior de-
                            pends on the value of QueryString and on the  val-
                            ues that you specify for QueryStringCacheKeys , if
                            any:

                            If you specify true for QueryString and you  don't
                            specify  any  values  for  QueryStringCacheKeys  ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the  origin  and  caches based on all query string
                            parameters. Depending on how many query string pa-
                            rameters  and  values you have, this can adversely
                            affect performance because CloudFront must forward
                            more requests to the origin.

                            If  you specify true for QueryString and you spec-
                            ify one or more values for QueryStringCacheKeys  ,
                            CloudFront forwards all query string parameters to
                            the origin, but it only caches based on the  query
                            string parameters that you specify.

                            If  you specify false for QueryString , CloudFront
                            doesn't forward any query string parameters to the
                            origin,  and  doesn't  cache based on query string
                            parameters.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  cookie  names in the Items
                                   list.

                               Items -> (list)

                        Headers -> (structure)
                            This field is deprecated. We  recommend  that  you
                            use a cache policy or an origin request policy in-
                            stead of this field.

                            If you want to include headers in the  cache  key,
                            use  a  cache  policy.  For  more information, see

                            If  you want to send headers to the origin but not
                            include them in the cache key, use an  origin  re-
                            quest  policy.  For more information, see Creating

                            also  caches  separate versions of a specified ob-
                            ject that is based on the header values in  viewer
                            requests.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of header names in the Items list.

                            Items -> (list)
                               A list of HTTP header names.

                            use a cache policy or an origin request policy in-
                            stead of this field.

                            If  you want to include query strings in the cache
                            key, use a cache policy. For more information, see

                            to use for caching for this cache behavior.

                            Quantity -> (integer)

          CustomErrorResponses -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls the following:

              o Whether  CloudFront  replaces HTTP status codes in the 4xx and
                5xx range with custom error messages before returning the  re-
                sponse to the viewer.

              o How  long  CloudFront  caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and
                5xx range.

              For more information about custom error pages,  see  Customizing
              Error Responses in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of HTTP status codes for which you want to specify
                 a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If Quantity is
                 0 , you can omit Items .

              Items -> (list)
                 A  complex  type  that contains a CustomErrorResponse element
                 for each HTTP status code for which you  want  to  specify  a
                 custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                 (structure)
                     A complex type that controls:

                     o Whether  CloudFront  replaces  HTTP status codes in the
                       4xx and 5xx range with custom error messages before re-
                       turning the response to the viewer.

                     o How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx
                       and 5xx range.

                     For  more  information  about  custom  error  pages,  see
                     Customizing  Error Responses in the Amazon CloudFront De-
                     veloper Guide .

                     ErrorCode -> (integer)
                        The HTTP status code for which you want to  specify  a
                        custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                     ResponsePagePath -> (string)
                        The path to the custom error page that you want Cloud-
                        Front to return to a viewer when your  origin  returns
                        the  HTTP status code specified by ErrorCode , for ex-
                        ample, /4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html . If you want to
                        store your objects and your custom error pages in dif-
                        ferent locations, your  distribution  must  include  a
                        cache behavior for which the following is true:

                        o The  value  of  PathPattern matches the path to your
                          custom error  messages.  For  example,  suppose  you
                          saved custom error pages for 4xx errors in an Amazon
                          S3 bucket in a directory named  /4xx-errors  .  Your
                          distribution must include a cache behavior for which
                          the path pattern routes requests for your custom er-
                          ror  pages  to  that location, for example, /4xx-er-
                          rors/* .

                        o The value of TargetOriginId specifies the  value  of
                          the  ID  element  for  the origin that contains your
                          custom error pages.

                        If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath , you must
                        also specify a value for ResponseCode .

                        We  recommend  that you store custom error pages in an
                        Amazon S3 bucket. If you store custom error  pages  on
                        an HTTP server and the server starts to return 5xx er-
                        rors, CloudFront can't get the files that you want  to
                        return  to  viewers  because  the origin server is un-
                        available.

                     ResponseCode -> (string)
                        The HTTP status code that you want CloudFront  to  re-
                        turn  to  the viewer along with the custom error page.
                        There are a variety of reasons  that  you  might  want
                        CloudFront  to return a status code different from the
                        status code that your origin returned  to  CloudFront,
                        for example:

                        o Some  Internet devices (some firewalls and corporate
                          proxies, for example) intercept HTTP 4xx and 5xx and
                          prevent  the  response  from  being  returned to the
                          viewer. If you substitute 200 , the  response  typi-
                          cally won't be intercepted.

                        o If you don't care about distinguishing among differ-
                          ent client errors or server errors, you can  specify
                          400  or  500  as the ResponseCode for all 4xx or 5xx
                          errors.

                        o You might want to return a 200 status code (OK)  and
                          static  website  so  your  customers don't know that
                          your website is down.

                        If you specify a value for  ResponseCode  ,  you  must
                        also specify a value for ResponsePagePath .

                     ErrorCachingMinTTL -> (long)
                        The  minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want
                        CloudFront to cache the HTTP status code specified  in
                        ErrorCode  . When this time period has elapsed, Cloud-
                        Front queries your origin to see whether  the  problem
                        that  caused  the  error has been resolved and the re-
                        quested object is now available.

                        For more information, see Customizing Error  Responses
                        in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

          Comment -> (string)
              An  optional  comment  to describe the distribution. The comment
              cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          Logging -> (structure)
              A complex type that controls whether access logs are written for
              the distribution.

              For  more information about logging, see Access Logs in the Ama-
              zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs  to
                 an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable logging when
                 you create a distribution or if you want to  disable  logging
                 for an existing distribution, specify false for Enabled , and
                 specify empty Bucket and  Prefix  elements.  If  you  specify
                 false  for Enabled but you specify values for Bucket , prefix
                 , and IncludeCookies , the values are automatically deleted.

              IncludeCookies -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include  cookies  in
                 access  logs, specify true for IncludeCookies . If you choose
                 to include cookies in logs, CloudFront logs all  cookies  re-
                 gardless  of  how  you configure the cache behaviors for this
                 distribution. If you don't want to include cookies  when  you
                 create a distribution or if you want to disable include cook-
                 ies for an existing distribution, specify false for  Include-
                 Cookies .

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for exam-
                 ple, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

              Prefix -> (string)
                 An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix to  the
                 access  log  filenames  for  this  distribution, for example,
                 myprefix/ . If you want to enable logging, but you don't want
                 to  specify  a prefix, you still must include an empty Prefix
                 element in the Logging element.

          PriceClass -> (string)
              The price class that corresponds with the maximum price that you
              want  to  pay  for  CloudFront  service.  If  you specify Price-
              Class_All , CloudFront responds to  requests  for  your  objects
              from all CloudFront edge locations.

              If  you specify a price class other than PriceClass_All , Cloud-
              Front serves your objects from the CloudFront edge location that
              has  the  lowest  latency among the edge locations in your price
              class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are excluded from
              your specified price class may encounter slower performance.

              For more information about price classes, see Choosing the Price
              Class for a CloudFront Distribution in the Amazon CloudFront De-
              veloper  Guide  .  For information about CloudFront pricing, in-

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              From  this field, you can enable or disable the selected distri-
              bution.

          ViewerCertificate -> (structure)
              A complex type that determines the distributions SSL/TLS config-
              uration for communicating with viewers.

              CloudFrontDefaultCertificate -> (boolean)
                 If  the  distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , set this field to true .

                 If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names  or
                 CNAMEs),  set  this field to false and specify values for the
                 following fields:

                 o ACMCertificateArn or IAMCertificateId (specify a value  for
                   one, not both)

                 o MinimumProtocolVersion

                 o SSLSupportMethod

              IAMCertificateId -> (string)
                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in Identity and
                 Access  Management (IAM) , provide the ID of the IAM certifi-
                 cate.

                 If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must  also  specify
                 values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupportMethod .

              ACMCertificateArn -> (string)
                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs) and the SSL/TLS certificate is stored in  Certificate
                 Manager (ACM) , provide the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the
                 ACM certificate. CloudFront only supports ACM certificates in
                 the US East (N. Virginia) Region (us-east-1 ).

                 If  you specify an ACM certificate ARN, you must also specify
                 values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupportMethod .

              SSLSupportMethod -> (string)
                 If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names  or
                 CNAMEs), specify which viewers the distribution accepts HTTPS
                 connections from.

                 o sni-only  The distribution accepts HTTPS  connections  from
                   only  viewers  that  support server name indication (SNI) .
                   This is recommended. Most browsers and clients support SNI.

                 o vip  The distribution accepts HTTPS  connections  from  all
                   viewers  including those that dont support SNI. This is not
                   recommended, and results in additional monthly charges from
                   CloudFront.

                 o static-ip - Do not specify this value unless your distribu-
                   tion has been enabled for this feature  by  the  CloudFront
                   team.  If  you  have a use case that requires static IP ad-
                   dresses for a distribution, contact CloudFront through  the
                   Amazon Web Services Support Center .

                 If  the  distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , dont set  a  value  for  this
                 field.

              MinimumProtocolVersion -> (string)
                 If  the  distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names or
                 CNAMEs), specify the security policy that you want CloudFront
                 to  use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The security pol-
                 icy determines two settings:

                 o The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that  CloudFront  can  use  to
                   communicate with viewers.

                 o The  ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the content
                   that it returns to viewers.

                 For more information, see Security Policy and Supported  Pro-
                 tocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and CloudFront in the Ama-
                 zon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 NOTE:
                     On the CloudFront console, this setting is  called  Secu-
                     rity Policy .

                 When  youre  using  SNI  only  (you  set  SSLSupportMethod to
                 sni-only ), you must specify TLSv1 or higher.

                 If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such  as
                 d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net  (you set CloudFrontDefaultCer-
                 tificate to true ), CloudFront automatically sets  the  secu-
                 rity  policy  to  TLSv1  regardless of the value that you set
                 here.

              Certificate -> (string)
                 This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields in-
                 stead:

                 o ACMCertificateArn

                 o IAMCertificateId

                 o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

              CertificateSource -> (string)
                 This field is deprecated. Use one of the following fields in-
                 stead:

                 o ACMCertificateArn

                 o IAMCertificateId

                 o CloudFrontDefaultCertificate

          Restrictions -> (structure)
              A complex type that identifies ways in which  you  want  to  re-
              strict distribution of your content.

              GeoRestriction -> (structure)
                 A complex type that controls the countries in which your con-
                 tent is distributed. CloudFront determines  the  location  of
                 your users using MaxMind GeoIP databases.

                 RestrictionType -> (string)
                     The  method that you want to use to restrict distribution
                     of your content by country:

                     o none : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access to
                       content is not restricted by client geo location.

                     o blacklist : The Location elements specify the countries
                       in which you don't want CloudFront to  distribute  your
                       content.

                     o whitelist : The Location elements specify the countries
                       in which you want CloudFront to  distribute  your  con-
                       tent.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     When  geo  restriction is enabled , this is the number of
                     countries in your whitelist  or  blacklist  .  Otherwise,
                     when  it is not enabled, Quantity is 0 , and you can omit
                     Items .

                 Items -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains a Location element for  each
                     country in which you want CloudFront either to distribute
                     your content (whitelist ) or not distribute your  content
                     (blacklist ).

                     The  Location  element is a two-letter, uppercase country
                     code for a country that  you  want  to  include  in  your
                     blacklist or whitelist . Include one Location element for
                     each country.

                     CloudFront and MaxMind both use ISO 3166  country  codes.
                     For  the  current list of countries and the corresponding
                     codes, see ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code on  the  International
                     Organization  for  Standardization  website. You can also
                     refer to the country  list  on  the  CloudFront  console,
                     which includes both country names and codes.

                     (string)

          WebACLId -> (string)
              A  unique  identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any, to
              associate with this distribution. To specify a web  ACL  created
              using  the  latest  version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for example
              arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/webacl/ExampleWe-
              bACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a . To specify a web ACL
              created  using  WAF  Classic,  use  the  ACL  ID,  for   example
              473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a .

              WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP
              and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to  CloudFront,  and  lets
              you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you
              specify, such as the IP addresses that requests  originate  from
              or  the values of query strings, CloudFront responds to requests
              either with the requested content or with  an  HTTP  403  status
              code  (Forbidden). You can also configure CloudFront to return a
              custom error page when a request is blocked. For  more  informa-
              tion about WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide .

          HttpVersion -> (string)
              (Optional)  Specify  the  maximum  HTTP version(s) that you want
              viewers to use to communicate with CloudFront. The default value
              for  new web distributions is http2 . Viewers that don't support
              HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

              For viewers and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers  must  support
              TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server Name Indication (SNI).

              For  viewers  and CloudFront to use HTTP/3, viewers must support
              TLSv1.3 and Server Name Indication  (SNI).  CloudFront  supports
              HTTP/3  connection  migration to allow the viewer to switch net-
              works without losing connection. For more information about con-
              nection  migration,  see  Connection  Migration at RFC 9000. For
              more information about supported TLSv1.3 ciphers, see  Supported
              protocols and ciphers between viewers and CloudFront .

          IsIPV6Enabled -> (boolean)
              If  you  want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS requests with an
              IPv6 address for your distribution, specify true . If you  spec-
              ify  false  ,  CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with the
              DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This  allows
              viewers to submit a second request, for an IPv4 address for your
              distribution.

              In general, you should enable IPv6 if you  have  users  on  IPv6
              networks who want to access your content. However, if you're us-
              ing signed URLs or signed cookies to  restrict  access  to  your
              content,  and  if you're using a custom policy that includes the
              IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses that can access
              your  content, don't enable IPv6. If you want to restrict access
              to some content by IP address and not restrict access  to  other
              content (or restrict access but not by IP address), you can cre-
              ate two distributions. For  more  information,  see  Creating  a
              Signed URL Using a Custom Policy in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
              oper Guide .

              If you're using an Route  53  Amazon  Web  Services  Integration
              alias  resource  record  set to route traffic to your CloudFront
              distribution, you need to create a second alias resource  record
              set when both of the following are true:

              o You enable IPv6 for the distribution

              o You're  using  alternate domain names in the URLs for your ob-
                jects

              For more information, see Routing Traffic to  an  Amazon  Cloud-
              Front Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name in the Route 53
              Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide .

              If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route 53
              Amazon Web Services Integration or with another DNS service, you
              don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will route  traf-
              fic  to your distribution regardless of the IP address format of
              the viewer request.

       --origin-domain-name (string) The domain name for your origin. This ar-
       gument and --distribution-config are mutually exclusive.

       --default-root-object  (string)  The object that you want CloudFront to
       return (for example, index.html) when a viewer request points  to  your
       root  URL.  This argument and --distribution-config are mutually exclu-
       sive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a CloudFront distribution

       The following example creates a distribution for an S3 bucket named aw-
       sexamplebucket,  and  also specifies index.html as the default root ob-
       ject, using command line arguments:

          aws cloudfront create-distribution \
              --origin-domain-name awsexamplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com \
              --default-root-object index.html

       Instead of using command line arguments, you can provide the  distribu-
       tion configuration in a JSON file, as shown in the following example:

          aws cloudfront create-distribution \
              --distribution-config file://dist-config.json

       The file dist-config.json is a JSON document in the current folder that
       contains the following:

              "CallerReference": "cli-example",

              WARNING:
                 We recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead of TrustedSigners
                 .

              CloudFront  automatically  adds  this  field  to the response if
              youve configured a cache behavior in this distribution to  serve
              private  content  using  trusted  signers. This field contains a
              list of Amazon Web Services account IDs and  the  active  Cloud-
              Front  key pairs in each account that CloudFront can use to ver-
              ify the signatures of signed URLs or signed cookies.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This field is true if any of the Amazon Web Services accounts
                 in  the list have active CloudFront key pairs that CloudFront
                 can use to verify the signatures of signed  URLs  and  signed
                 cookies. If not, this field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services accounts in the list.

                        verify  the signatures of signed URLs and signed cook-
                        ies. If the Amazon Web Services account that owns  the
                        key pairs is the same account that owns the CloudFront
                        distribution, the value of this field is self .

          ActiveTrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
              CloudFront automatically adds this  field  to  the  response  if
              youve  configured a cache behavior in this distribution to serve
              private content using key groups. This field contains a list  of
              key groups and the public keys in each key group that CloudFront

              ies.

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 This  field is true if any of the key groups have public keys
                 that CloudFront can use to verify the  signatures  of  signed
                 URLs and signed cookies. If not, this field is false .

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 The number of key groups in the list.

              Items -> (list)
                 A list of key groups, including the identifiers of the public

                     signed cookies.

                     KeyGroupId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the key group that contains the pub-
                        lic keys.

                     KeyPairIds -> (structure)
                        A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                        Items -> (list)
                            A list of CloudFront key pair identifiers.

                            (string)

          DistributionConfig -> (structure)
              The current configuration information for the distribution. Send
              a  GET  request  to  the /*CloudFront API version* /distribution
              ID/config resource.

              CallerReference -> (string)
                 A unique value (for example, a date-time stamp) that  ensures
                 that the request can't be replayed.

                 If  the  value  of  CallerReference is new (regardless of the
                 content of the DistributionConfig object), CloudFront creates
                 a new distribution.

                 If CallerReference is a value that you already sent in a pre-
                 vious request to create a distribution, CloudFront returns  a
                 DistributionAlreadyExists error.

              Aliases -> (structure)
                 A complex type that contains information about CNAMEs (alter-
                 nate domain names), if any, for this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of CNAME aliases, if any, that you want to as-
                     sociate with this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A  complex  type that contains the CNAME aliases, if any,
                     that you want to associate with this distribution.

                     (string)

              DefaultRootObject -> (string)
                 The object that you want CloudFront to request from your ori-
                 gin  (for  example,  index.html  ) when a viewer requests the
                 root URL for your distribution (http://www.example.com )  in-
                 stead  of  an  object  in your distribution (http://www.exam-
                 ple.com/product-description.html ). Specifying a default root
                 object avoids exposing the contents of your distribution.

                 Specify only the object name, for example, index.html . Don't
                 add a / before the object name.

                 If you don't want to specify a default root object  when  you
                 create a distribution, include an empty DefaultRootObject el-
                 ement.

                 To delete the default root object from an existing  distribu-
                 tion,  update  the  distribution configuration and include an
                 empty DefaultRootObject element.

                 To replace the default root object, update  the  distribution
                 configuration and specify the new object.

                 For  more  information  about  the  default  root object, see
                 Creating a Default Root Object in the Amazon  CloudFront  De-
                 veloper Guide .

              Origins -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type  that contains information about origins for
                 this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of origins for this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     A list of origins.

                     (structure)
                        An origin.

                        An origin is the location where content is stored, and
                        from  which  CloudFront gets content to serve to view-
                        ers. To specify an origin:

                        o Use S3OriginConfig to specify an  Amazon  S3  bucket
                          that is not configured with static website hosting.

                        o Use CustomOriginConfig to specify all other kinds of
                          origins, including:

                          o An Amazon S3 bucket that is configured with static
                            website hosting

                          o An Elastic Load Balancing load balancer

                          o An AWS Elemental MediaPackage endpoint

                          o An AWS Elemental MediaStore container

                          o Any  other  HTTP  server, running on an Amazon EC2

                                   HeaderValue elements, if any, for this dis-
                                   tribution.

                                   HeaderName -> (string)
                                      The  name  of  a  header  that  you want
                                      CloudFront to send to your  origin.  For
                                      more   information,  see  Adding  Custom

                        S3OriginConfig -> (structure)
                            Use this type to specify an origin that is an Ama-
                            zon  S3  bucket that is not configured with static
                            website hosting. To specify any other type of ori-
                            gin, including an Amazon S3 bucket that is config-
                            ured with static website hosting, use the CustomO-
                            riginConfig type instead.

                            OriginAccessIdentity -> (string)
                               The  CloudFront origin access identity to asso-
                               ciate with the origin.  Use  an  origin  access
                               identity  to configure the origin so that view-
                               ers can only access objects  in  an  Amazon  S3
                               bucket  through  CloudFront.  The format of the
                               value is:

                               origin-access-identity/cloudfront/ID-of-ori-
                               gin-access-identity

                               where `` ID-of-origin-access-identity `` is the
                               value that CloudFront returned in the  ID  ele-
                               ment  when  you created the origin access iden-
                               tity.

                               If you want viewers to be able  to  access  ob-
                               jects  using  either  the CloudFront URL or the
                               Amazon S3 URL, specify an empty  OriginAccessI-
                               dentity element.

                               To  delete  the  origin access identity from an
                               existing distribution, update the  distribution
                               configuration and include an empty OriginAcces-
                               sIdentity element.

                               To replace the origin access  identity,  update
                               the  distribution configuration and specify the
                               new origin access identity.

                               For more information about  the  origin  access
                               identity,  see  Serving Private Content through
                               CloudFront in the Amazon  CloudFront  Developer

                        CustomOriginConfig -> (structure)
                            Use  this type to specify an origin that is not an
                            Amazon S3 bucket, with one exception. If the  Ama-
                            zon  S3  bucket  is configured with static website
                            hosting, use this type. If the Amazon S3 bucket is
                            not  configured  with  static website hosting, use
                            the S3OriginConfig type instead.

                            HTTPPort -> (integer)
                               The HTTP port that CloudFront uses  to  connect
                               to  the  origin. Specify the HTTP port that the
                               origin listens on.

                            HTTPSPort -> (integer)
                               The HTTPS port that CloudFront uses to  connect
                               to  the origin. Specify the HTTPS port that the
                               origin listens on.

                            OriginProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                               Specifies the protocol  (HTTP  or  HTTPS)  that
                               CloudFront uses to connect to the origin. Valid
                               values are:

                               o http-only  CloudFront  always  uses  HTTP  to
                                 connect to the origin.

                               o match-viewer  CloudFront connects to the ori-
                                 gin using the same protocol that  the  viewer
                                 used to connect to CloudFront.

                               o https-only   CloudFront  always uses HTTPS to
                                 connect to the origin.

                            OriginSslProtocols -> (structure)
                               Specifies the  minimum  SSL/TLS  protocol  that
                               CloudFront  uses when connecting to your origin
                               over HTTPS. Valid values include SSLv3 ,  TLSv1
                               , TLSv1.1 , and TLSv1.2 .

                               For  more  information,  see Minimum Origin SSL

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  SSL/TLS protocols that you
                                   want to allow CloudFront to use when estab-
                                   lishing  an HTTPS connection with this ori-
                                   gin.

                               Items -> (list)
                                   A list that contains allowed SSL/TLS proto-
                                   cols for this distribution.

                                   (string)

                            OriginReadTimeout -> (integer)
                               Specifies  how  long,  in  seconds,  CloudFront
                               waits for a response from the origin.  This  is
                               also known as the origin response timeout . The
                               minimum timeout is 1 second, the maximum is  60
                               seconds,  and  the default (if you dont specify
                               otherwise) is 30 seconds.

                               For more information, see Origin Response Time-
                               out in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            OriginKeepaliveTimeout -> (integer)
                               Specifies how long, in seconds, CloudFront per-
                               sists its connection to the origin. The minimum
                               timeout is 1 second, the maximum is 60 seconds,
                               and the default (if you dont specify otherwise)
                               is 5 seconds.

                            connect to the origin. The minimum  number  is  1,
                            the  maximum  is  3,  and the default (if you dont
                            specify otherwise) is 3.

                            For a custom origin (including an Amazon S3 bucket
                            thats  configured  with  static  website hosting),
                            this value also specifies the number of times that
                            CloudFront  attempts  to  get  a response from the
                            origin, in the case of an Origin Response  Timeout
                            .

                            For  more  information,  see Origin Connection At-

                        OriginShield -> (structure)
                            CloudFront  Origin Shield. Using Origin Shield can
                            help reduce the load on your origin.

                            For more information, see Using Origin  Shield  in
                            the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                            Enabled -> (boolean)

                               enabled.

                               When its enabled,  CloudFront  routes  all  re-
                               quests  through  Origin  Shield, which can help
                               protect your origin. When its disabled,  Cloud-
                               Front might send requests directly to your ori-
                               gin from multiple edge  locations  or  regional
                               edge caches.

                            OriginShieldRegion -> (string)
                               The  Amazon  Web  Services  Region  for  Origin
                               Shield.

                               Specify the Amazon Web Services Region that has
                               the lowest latency to your origin. To specify a
                               region, use the region  code,  not  the  region
                               name.  For  example, specify the US East (Ohio)
                               region as us-east-2 .

                               When you enable CloudFront Origin  Shield,  you
                               must specify the Amazon Web Services Region for
                               Origin Shield. For the list of Amazon Web  Ser-
                               vices  Regions  that  you  can specify, and for

              OriginGroups -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains information about origin groups
                 for this distribution.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of origin groups.

                 Items -> (list)
                     The items (origin groups) in a distribution.

                     (structure)
                        An origin group includes two origins (a primary origin
                        and  a  second  origin  to failover to) and a failover
                        criteria that you specify. You create an origin  group
                        to  support  origin  failover  in CloudFront. When you
                        create or update a distribution, you can specifiy  the
                        origin  group  instead  of a single origin, and Cloud-
                        Front will failover from the  primary  origin  to  the
                        second  origin  under  the  failover  conditions  that
                        you've chosen.

                        Id -> (string)
                            The origin group's ID.

                        FailoverCriteria -> (structure)
                            A complex type that contains information about the
                            failover criteria for an origin group.

                            StatusCodes -> (structure)
                               The  status  codes that, when returned from the
                               primary  origin,  will  trigger  CloudFront  to
                               failover to the second origin.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The number of status codes.

                                   The  items  (status  codes)  for  an origin
                                   group.

                                   (integer)

                        Members -> (structure)
                            A complex type that contains information about the
                            origins in an origin group.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of origins in an origin group.

                               Items (origins) in an origin group.

                               (structure)
                                   An origin in an origin group.

                                   OriginId -> (string)
                                      The ID for an origin in an origin group.

              DefaultCacheBehavior -> (structure)
                 A  complex  type that describes the default cache behavior if
                 you don't specify a CacheBehavior element or if  files  don't
                 match  any of the values of PathPattern in CacheBehavior ele-
                 ments. You must create exactly one default cache behavior.

                 TargetOriginId -> (string)
                     The value of ID for the origin that you  want  CloudFront
                     to  route requests to when they use the default cache be-
                     havior.

                 TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                     WARNING:
                        We recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead of  Trust-
                        edSigners .

                     A  list  of  Amazon Web Services account IDs whose public
                     keys CloudFront can use to validate signed URLs or signed
                     cookies.

                     When  a  cache  behavior contains trusted signers, Cloud-
                     Front requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all  re-
                     quests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies
                     must be signed with the private key of a  CloudFront  key
                     pair  in  a  trusted signers Amazon Web Services account.
                     The signed URL or cookie contains information about which
                     public key CloudFront should use to verify the signature.

                        This  field  is true if any of the Amazon Web Services
                        accounts have public keys that CloudFront can  use  to

                        A list of Amazon Web Services account identifiers.

                        (string)

                 TrustedKeyGroups -> (structure)
                     A  list of key groups that CloudFront can use to validate
                     signed URLs or signed cookies.

                     When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups, Cloud-
                     Front  requires signed URLs or signed cookies for all re-
                     quests that match the cache behavior. The URLs or cookies
                     must  be  signed  with  a private key whose corresponding
                     public key is in the key group. The signed URL or  cookie
                     contains  information  about  which public key CloudFront
                     should use to verify the signature. For more information,

                        (string)

                 ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                     The  protocol that viewers can use to access the files in
                     the origin specified by  TargetOriginId  when  a  request
                     matches the path pattern in PathPattern . You can specify
                     the following options:

                     o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                     o redirect-to-https : If a viewer  submits  an  HTTP  re-
                       quest,  CloudFront  returns  an HTTP status code of 301
                       (Moved Permanently) to the viewer along with the  HTTPS
                       URL.  The  viewer  then resubmits the request using the
                       new URL.

                     o https-only : If a viewer sends an HTTP request,  Cloud-
                       Front returns an HTTP status code of 403 (Forbidden).

                     For  more information about requiring the HTTPS protocol,
                     see Requiring HTTPS Between Viewers and CloudFront in the
                     Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve an ob-
                        ject that was fetched from the origin using  HTTPS  is
                        never  to  use any other protocol to fetch the object.
                        If you have recently changed from HTTP  to  HTTPS,  we
                        recommend  that  you  clear your objects cache because
                        cached objects are protocol agnostic. That means  that
                        an  edge location will return an object from the cache
                        regardless of whether  the  current  request  protocol
                        matches  the protocol used previously. For more infor-
                        mation, see Managing Cache Expiration  in  the  Amazon

                 AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                     A  complex  type  that controls which HTTP methods Cloud-
                     Front processes and forwards to your Amazon S3 bucket  or
                     your custom origin. There are three choices:

                     o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                     o CloudFront  forwards  only GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS re-
                       quests.

                     o CloudFront forwards GET,  HEAD,  OPTIONS,  PUT,  PATCH,
                       POST , and DELETE requests.

                     If  you  pick  the third choice, you may need to restrict
                     access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to your custom  origin
                     so  users  can't  perform  operations that you don't want
                     them to. For example, you might not want  users  to  have
                     permissions to delete objects from your origin.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The number of HTTP methods that you want CloudFront to
                        forward to your origin. Valid values are  2  (for  GET
                        and  HEAD  requests),  3 (for GET , HEAD , and OPTIONS
                        requests) and 7 (for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS,  PUT,  PATCH,
                        POST , and DELETE requests).

                     Items -> (list)
                        A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that you
                        want CloudFront to process and forward to your origin.

                        (string)

                     CachedMethods -> (structure)
                        A complex type that controls whether CloudFront caches
                        the  response  to  requests  using  the specified HTTP
                        methods. There are two choices:

                        o CloudFront caches responses  to  GET  and  HEAD  re-
                          quests.

                        o CloudFront  caches responses to GET , HEAD , and OP-
                          TIONS requests.

                        If you pick the second choice for your Amazon S3  Ori-
                        gin,   you  may  need  to  forward  Access-Control-Re-
                        quest-Method, Access-Control-Request-Headers, and Ori-
                        gin headers for the responses to be cached correctly.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The  number  of  HTTP  methods  for which you want
                            CloudFront to cache responses. Valid values are  2
                            (for  caching  responses to GET and HEAD requests)
                            and 3 (for caching responses to GET , HEAD  ,  and
                            OPTIONS requests).

                        Items -> (list)
                            A complex type that contains the HTTP methods that
                            you want CloudFront to cache responses to.

                            (string)

                 SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)
                     Indicates whether you want to distribute media  files  in
                     the  Microsoft  Smooth  Streaming format using the origin
                     that is associated with this cache behavior. If so, spec-
                     ify  true  ;  if not, specify false . If you specify true
                     for SmoothStreaming , you can still distribute other con-
                     tent using this cache behavior if the content matches the
                     value of PathPattern .

                 Compress -> (boolean)
                     Whether you want  CloudFront  to  automatically  compress
                     certain  files  for  this  cache behavior. If so, specify
                     true ; if not, specify false . For more information,  see

                 LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                     A complex type that contains  zero  or  more  Lambda@Edge
                     function associations for a cache behavior.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  Lambda@Edge function associations for
                        this cache behavior.

                     Items -> (list)
                            Optional : A complex type  that  contains  Lambda-
                            FunctionAssociation items for this cache behavior.
                            If Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                        (structure)
                            A complex type that contains a  Lambda@Edge  func-
                            tion association.

                            LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                               The  ARN  of the Lambda@Edge function. You must
                               specify the ARN  of  a  function  version;  you
                               can't specify an alias or $LATEST.

                            EventType -> (string)
                               Specifies   the  event  type  that  triggers  a
                               Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can  spec-
                               ify the following values:

                               o viewer-request  :  The function executes when
                                 CloudFront receives a request from  a  viewer
                                 and  before  it checks to see whether the re-
                                 quested object is in the edge cache.

                               o origin-request : The function  executes  only
                                 when  CloudFront sends a request to your ori-
                                 gin. When the requested object is in the edge
                                 cache, the function doesn't execute.

                               o origin-response : The function executes after
                                 CloudFront receives a response from the  ori-
                                 gin  and  before  it caches the object in the
                                 response. When the requested object is in the
                                 edge cache, the function doesn't execute.

                               o viewer-response  :  The function executes be-
                                 fore CloudFront returns the requested  object
                                 to  the viewer. The function executes regard-
                                 less of whether the object was already in the
                                 edge  cache.  If  the  origin returns an HTTP
                                 status code other than  HTTP  200  (OK),  the
                                 function doesn't execute.

                            IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                               A  flag  that  allows a Lambda@Edge function to
                               have read access to the body content. For  more
                               information,  see Accessing the Request Body by

                     If you want to send values to the origin but not  include
                     them  in the cache key, use an origin request policy. For

                     A complex type  that  specifies  how  CloudFront  handles
                     query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                     QueryString -> (boolean)
                        This  field is deprecated. We recommend that you use a
                        cache policy or an origin request  policy  instead  of
                        this field.

                        If you want to include query strings in the cache key,
                        use a cache policy. For more information, see Creating
                        cache  policies  in  the  Amazon  CloudFront Developer
                        Guide .

                        If you want to send query strings to  the  origin  but
                        not  include  them in the cache key, use an origin re-
                        quest policy. For more information, see Creating  ori-
                        gin  request  policies in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-

                        Indicates whether you want CloudFront to forward query
                        strings  to  the  origin  that is associated with this
                        cache behavior and cache based on the query string pa-
                        rameters.  CloudFront behavior depends on the value of
                        QueryString and on the values  that  you  specify  for
                        QueryStringCacheKeys , if any:

                        If  you  specify  true  for  QueryString and you don't
                        specify any values for QueryStringCacheKeys  ,  Cloud-
                        Front forwards all query string parameters to the ori-
                        gin and caches based on all query  string  parameters.
                        Depending on how many query string parameters and val-
                        ues you have, this can  adversely  affect  performance
                        because  CloudFront  must forward more requests to the
                        origin.

                        If you specify true for QueryString  and  you  specify
                        one  or  more values for QueryStringCacheKeys , Cloud-
                        Front forwards all query string parameters to the ori-
                        gin,  but it only caches based on the query string pa-
                        rameters that you specify.

                        If you specify  false  for  QueryString  ,  CloudFront
                        doesn't  forward  any  query  string parameters to the
                        origin, and doesn't cache based on query string param-
                        eters.

              CacheBehaviors -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that contains zero or more CacheBehavior ele-
                 ments.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of cache behaviors for this distribution.

                 Items -> (list)
                     Optional: A complex type that  contains  cache  behaviors
                     for  this  distribution.  If Quantity is 0 , you can omit
                     Items .

                     (structure)
                        A complex type that describes how CloudFront processes
                        requests.

                        You  must create at least as many cache behaviors (in-
                        cluding the default cache behavior) as you  have  ori-
                        gins  if you want CloudFront to serve objects from all
                        of the origins. Each cache behavior specifies the  one
                        origin  from which you want CloudFront to get objects.
                        If you have two origins and only the default cache be-
                        havior,  the  default cache behavior will cause Cloud-
                        Front to get objects from one of the origins, but  the
                        other origin is never used.

                        For the current quota (formerly known as limit) on the
                        number of cache behaviors that you can add to  a  dis-
                        tribution,  see Quotas in the Amazon CloudFront Devel-
                        oper Guide .

                        If you dont want to specify any cache  behaviors,  in-
                        clude  only  an empty CacheBehaviors element. Dont in-
                        clude an empty CacheBehavior element because  this  is
                        invalid.

                        To delete all cache behaviors in an existing distribu-
                        tion, update the distribution  configuration  and  in-
                        clude only an empty CacheBehaviors element.

                        To add, change, or remove one or more cache behaviors,
                        update the distribution configuration and specify  all
                        of the cache behaviors that you want to include in the
                        updated distribution.

                        For more information about cache behaviors, see  Cache
                        Behavior  Settings  in the Amazon CloudFront Developer
                        Guide .

                        PathPattern -> (string)
                            The pattern  (for  example,  images/*.jpg  )  that
                            specifies which requests to apply the behavior to.
                            When CloudFront receives a viewer request, the re-
                            quested path is compared with path patterns in the
                            order in which cache behaviors are listed  in  the
                            distribution.

                            NOTE:
                               You  can optionally include a slash (/ ) at the
                               beginning of the  path  pattern.  For  example,
                               /images/*.jpg . CloudFront behavior is the same
                               with or without the leading / .

                            The path pattern for the default cache behavior is
                            * and cannot be changed. If the request for an ob-
                            ject does not match the path pattern for any cache
                            behaviors,  CloudFront applies the behavior in the
                            default cache behavior.

                            For more information, see Path Pattern in the Ama-

                        TargetOriginId -> (string)
                            The  value  of  ID  for  the  origin that you want
                            CloudFront to route requests to  when  they  match
                            this cache behavior.

                        TrustedSigners -> (structure)

                            WARNING:
                               We  recommend using TrustedKeyGroups instead of
                               TrustedSigners .

                            A list of Amazon Web Services  account  IDs  whose

                            When a cache behavior  contains  trusted  signers,
                            CloudFront  requires signed URLs or signed cookies
                            for all requests that match  the  cache  behavior.
                            The  URLs  or cookies must be signed with the pri-
                            vate key of a CloudFront key pair in  the  trusted

                            URL or cookie  contains  information  about  which
                            public  key  CloudFront  should  use to verify the
                            signature. For more information, see Serving  pri-

                            validate signed URLs or signed cookies.

                            When a cache behavior contains trusted key groups,
                            CloudFront requires signed URLs or signed  cookies
                            for  all  requests  that match the cache behavior.
                            The URLs or cookies must be signed with a  private
                            key  whose  corresponding public key is in the key
                            group. The signed URL or cookie contains  informa-
                            tion  about which public key CloudFront should use
                            to verify the signature. For more information, see

                        ViewerProtocolPolicy -> (string)
                            The  protocol  that  viewers can use to access the
                            files in the origin  specified  by  TargetOriginId
                            when  a  request matches the path pattern in Path-
                            Pattern . You can specify the following options:

                            o allow-all : Viewers can use HTTP or HTTPS.

                            o redirect-to-https : If a viewer submits an  HTTP
                              request,  CloudFront returns an HTTP status code
                              of 301 (Moved Permanently) to the  viewer  along
                              with  the  HTTPS  URL. The viewer then resubmits
                              the request using the new URL.

                            o https-only : If a viewer sends an HTTP  request,
                              CloudFront  returns  an  HTTP status code of 403
                              (Forbidden).

                            Guide .

                            NOTE:
                               The only way to guarantee that viewers retrieve
                               an object that was fetched from the origin  us-
                               ing HTTPS is never to use any other protocol to
                               fetch the object. If you have recently  changed
                               from HTTP to HTTPS, we recommend that you clear
                               your objects cache because cached  objects  are
                               protocol  agnostic. That means that an edge lo-
                               cation will return an object from the cache re-
                               gardless  of whether the current request proto-
                               col matches the protocol used  previously.  For
                               more information, see Managing Cache Expiration
                               in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        AllowedMethods -> (structure)
                            A complex type that controls  which  HTTP  methods
                            CloudFront  processes  and forwards to your Amazon
                            S3 bucket or your custom origin. There  are  three
                            choices:

                            o CloudFront forwards only GET and HEAD requests.

                            o CloudFront  forwards  only  GET , HEAD , and OP-
                              TIONS requests.

                            o CloudFront forwards  GET,  HEAD,  OPTIONS,  PUT,
                              PATCH, POST , and DELETE requests.

                            If  you pick the third choice, you may need to re-
                            strict access to your Amazon S3 bucket or to  your
                            custom  origin  so  users can't perform operations
                            that you don't want  them  to.  For  example,  you
                            might not want users to have permissions to delete
                            objects from your origin.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of HTTP methods that you want Cloud-
                               Front  to  forward to your origin. Valid values
                               are 2 (for GET and HEAD requests), 3 (for GET ,
                               HEAD  ,  and  OPTIONS requests) and 7 (for GET,
                               HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST  ,  and  DELETE
                               requests).

                            Items -> (list)
                               A  complex  type that contains the HTTP methods
                               that you want CloudFront to process and forward
                               to your origin.

                               caches the response to requests using the spec-
                               ified HTTP methods. There are two choices:

                               o CloudFront  caches  responses to GET and HEAD
                                 requests.

                               o CloudFront caches responses to GET ,  HEAD  ,
                                 and OPTIONS requests.

                               If  you  pick the second choice for your Amazon
                               S3 Origin, you may need to forward  Access-Con-
                               trol-Request-Method,         Access-Control-Re-
                               quest-Headers, and Origin headers for  the  re-
                               sponses to be cached correctly.

                               Quantity -> (integer)
                                   The  number  of  HTTP methods for which you
                                   want CloudFront to cache  responses.  Valid
                                   values  are 2 (for caching responses to GET
                                   and HEAD requests) and 3 (for  caching  re-
                                   sponses  to  GET  ,  HEAD , and OPTIONS re-
                                   quests).

                               Items -> (list)
                                   A complex type that contains the HTTP meth-
                                   ods  that  you want CloudFront to cache re-
                                   sponses to.

                                   (string)

                        SmoothStreaming -> (boolean)

                            files in the Microsoft Smooth Streaming format us-
                            ing the origin that is associated with this  cache
                            behavior.  If  so,  specify true ; if not, specify
                            false . If you specify true for SmoothStreaming  ,
                            you  can still distribute other content using this
                            cache behavior if the content matches the value of
                            PathPattern .

                        Compress -> (boolean)

                        LambdaFunctionAssociations -> (structure)
                            A   complex   type  that  contains  zero  or  more
                            Lambda@Edge function associations for a cache  be-
                            havior.

                            Quantity -> (integer)

                                   cache behavior. If Quantity is 0 , you  can
                                   omit Items .

                               (structure)
                                   A  complex type that contains a Lambda@Edge
                                   function association.

                                   LambdaFunctionARN -> (string)
                                      The ARN of the Lambda@Edge function. You
                                      must  specify the ARN of a function ver-
                                      sion; you  can't  specify  an  alias  or
                                      $LATEST.

                                   EventType -> (string)
                                      Specifies the event type that triggers a
                                      Lambda@Edge function invocation. You can
                                      specify the following values:

                                      o viewer-request : The function executes
                                        when  CloudFront  receives  a  request
                                        from  a viewer and before it checks to
                                        see whether the requested object is in
                                        the edge cache.

                                      o origin-request : The function executes
                                        only when CloudFront sends  a  request
                                        to your origin. When the requested ob-
                                        ject is in the edge cache,  the  func-
                                        tion doesn't execute.

                                      o origin-response  :  The  function exe-
                                        cutes after CloudFront receives a  re-
                                        sponse  from  the origin and before it
                                        caches the  object  in  the  response.
                                        When  the  requested  object is in the
                                        edge cache, the function doesn't  exe-
                                        cute.

                                      o viewer-response  :  The  function exe-
                                        cutes before  CloudFront  returns  the
                                        requested  object  to  the viewer. The
                                        function   executes   regardless    of
                                        whether  the object was already in the
                                        edge cache. If the origin  returns  an
                                        HTTP  status  code other than HTTP 200
                                        (OK), the function doesn't execute.

                                   IncludeBody -> (boolean)
                                      A flag that allows a  Lambda@Edge  func-
                                      tion  to  have  read  access to the body
                                      content.  For  more   information,   see

                            A list of CloudFront functions that are associated
                            with this  cache  behavior.  CloudFront  functions
                            must  be  published to the LIVE stage to associate
                            them with a cache behavior.

                            Quantity -> (integer)
                               The number of CloudFront functions in the list.

                               tion. CloudFront functions must be published to
                               the  LIVE  stage to associate them with a cache
                               behavior.

                               (structure)
                                   A CloudFront function  that  is  associated
                                   with  a cache behavior in a CloudFront dis-
                                   tribution.

                                   FunctionARN -> (string)
                                      The Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  of  the
                                      function.

                                   EventType -> (string)
                                      The  event  type of the function, either
                                      viewer-request or viewer-response .  You
                                      cannot  use  origin-facing  event  types
                                      (origin-request  and  origin-response  )
                                      with a CloudFront function.

                        FieldLevelEncryptionId -> (string)

                            configuration that you want CloudFront to use  for
                            encrypting  specific fields of data for this cache
                            behavior.

                        RealtimeLogConfigArn -> (string)
                            The Amazon Resource Name (ARN)  of  the  real-time
                            log  configuration  that is attached to this cache
                            behavior. For more information, see Real-time logs
                            in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                        CachePolicyId -> (string)
                            The  unique identifier of the cache policy that is
                            attached to this cache behavior. For more informa-
                            tion,  see  Creating  cache  policies or Using the

                            Developer Guide .

                            A  CacheBehavior  must include either a CachePoli-
                            cyId or ForwardedValues . We  recommend  that  you
                            use a CachePolicyId .

                        OriginRequestPolicyId -> (string)
                            The unique identifier of the origin request policy
                            that is attached to this cache behavior. For  more

                            The identifier for a response headers policy.

                        ForwardedValues -> (structure)
                            This  field  is  deprecated. We recommend that you
                            use a cache policy or an origin request policy in-
                            stead  of  this  field.  For more information, see

                            If  you  want  to include values in the cache key,
                            use a cache  policy.  For  more  information,  see
                            Creating cache policies or Using the managed cache
                            policies in the Amazon CloudFront Developer  Guide
                            .

                            If  you  want to send values to the origin but not
                            include them in the cache key, use an  origin  re-
                            quest  policy.  For more information, see Creating
                            origin request policies or Using the managed  ori-

                            A CacheBehavior must include either  a  CachePoli-
                            cyId  or  ForwardedValues  . We recommend that you
                            use a CachePolicyId .

                            A complex type that specifies how CloudFront  han-
                            dles query strings, cookies, and HTTP headers.

                            QueryString -> (boolean)
                               This field is deprecated. We recommend that you
                               use a cache policy or an origin request  policy
                               instead of this field.

                               If  you  want  to  include query strings in the
                               cache key, use a cache policy. For more  infor-
                               mation, see Creating cache policies in the Ama-

                               If you want to send query strings to the origin
                               but  not  include them in the cache key, use an
                               origin request policy.  For  more  information,
                               see  Creating  origin  request  policies in the

                               on  the query string parameters. CloudFront be-
                               havior depends on the value of QueryString  and
                               on the values that you specify for QueryString-
                               CacheKeys , if any:

                               If you specify true  for  QueryString  and  you

                               based on all query string parameters. Depending
                               on  how many query string parameters and values
                               you have, this can adversely affect performance
                               because  CloudFront  must forward more requests
                               to the origin.

                               If you specify true  for  QueryString  and  you
                               specify  one  or  more  values for QueryString-
                               CacheKeys  ,  CloudFront  forwards  all   query
                               string  parameters  to  the origin, but it only
                               caches based on  the  query  string  parameters
                               that you specify.

                               If  you  specify false for QueryString , Cloud-
                               Front doesn't forward any query string  parame-
                               ters  to the origin, and doesn't cache based on
                               query string parameters.

                            The maximum amount of time that you  want  objects
                            to  stay  in  CloudFront  caches before CloudFront
                            forwards another request to your origin to  deter-

              CustomErrorResponses -> (structure)
                 A complex type that controls the following:

                 o Whether  CloudFront  replaces  HTTP status codes in the 4xx
                   and 5xx range with custom error messages  before  returning
                   the response to the viewer.

                 o How long CloudFront caches HTTP status codes in the 4xx and
                   5xx range.

                 Quantity -> (integer)
                     The number of HTTP status codes for  which  you  want  to
                     specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration. If
                     Quantity is 0 , you can omit Items .

                 Items -> (list)
                     A complex type that contains a  CustomErrorResponse  ele-
                     ment  for  each  HTTP  status  code for which you want to
                     specify a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                        Developer Guide .

                        ErrorCode -> (integer)
                            The HTTP status code for which you want to specify
                            a custom error page and/or a caching duration.

                        ResponsePagePath -> (string)
                            The path to the custom error page  that  you  want
                            CloudFront  to return to a viewer when your origin
                            returns the HTTP status code specified  by  Error-
                            Code , for example, /4xx-errors/403-forbidden.html
                            . If you want to store your objects and your  cus-
                            tom  error pages in different locations, your dis-
                            tribution must include a cache behavior for  which
                            the following is true:

                            o The  value  of  PathPattern  matches the path to
                              your custom error messages. For example, suppose
                              you  saved  custom error pages for 4xx errors in
                              an  Amazon  S3  bucket  in  a  directory   named
                              /4xx-errors  .  Your distribution must include a
                              cache behavior for which the path pattern routes
                              requests for your custom error pages to that lo-
                              cation, for example, /4xx-errors/* .

                            o The value of TargetOriginId specifies the  value
                              of  the  ID element for the origin that contains
                              your custom error pages.

                            If you specify a value for ResponsePagePath ,  you
                            must also specify a value for ResponseCode .

                            We  recommend that you store custom error pages in
                            an Amazon S3 bucket. If  you  store  custom  error
                            pages  on  an HTTP server and the server starts to
                            return 5xx errors, CloudFront can't get the  files
                            that  you  want  to  return to viewers because the
                            origin server is unavailable.

                        ResponseCode -> (string)
                            The HTTP status code that you want  CloudFront  to
                            return  to  the viewer along with the custom error
                            page. There are a  variety  of  reasons  that  you
                            might want CloudFront to return a status code dif-
                            ferent from the status code that your  origin  re-
                            turned to CloudFront, for example:

                            o Some Internet devices (some firewalls and corpo-
                              rate proxies, for example)  intercept  HTTP  4xx
                              and  5xx and prevent the response from being re-
                              turned to the viewer. If you  substitute  200  ,
                              the response typically won't be intercepted.

                            o If  you  don't  care  about distinguishing among
                              different client errors or  server  errors,  you
                              can  specify  400 or 500 as the ResponseCode for
                              all 4xx or 5xx errors.

                            o You might want to return a 200 status code  (OK)
                              and  static website so your customers don't know
                              that your website is down.

                            If you specify a value for ResponseCode , you must
                            also specify a value for ResponsePagePath .

                        ErrorCachingMinTTL -> (long)
                            The  minimum  amount of time, in seconds, that you
                            want CloudFront to  cache  the  HTTP  status  code
                            specified in ErrorCode . When this time period has
                            elapsed, CloudFront queries  your  origin  to  see
                            whether the problem that caused the error has been
                            resolved and the requested object  is  now  avail-
                            able.

                            For  more  information,  see Customizing Error Re-
                            sponses in the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

              Comment -> (string)
                 An optional comment to describe the distribution. The comment
                 cannot be longer than 128 characters.

              Logging -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that controls whether access logs are written
                 for the distribution.

                 For more information about logging, see Access  Logs  in  the
                 Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to save access logs
                     to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you don't want to enable  log-
                     ging  when  you  create  a distribution or if you want to
                     disable logging for  an  existing  distribution,  specify
                     false  for  Enabled , and specify empty Bucket and Prefix
                     elements. If you specify false for Enabled but you  spec-
                     ify values for Bucket , prefix , and IncludeCookies , the
                     values are automatically deleted.

                 IncludeCookies -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether you want CloudFront to include  cookies
                     in  access logs, specify true for IncludeCookies . If you
                     choose to include cookies in logs,  CloudFront  logs  all
                     cookies  regardless of how you configure the cache behav-
                     iors for this distribution. If you don't want to  include
                     cookies  when you create a distribution or if you want to
                     disable include cookies  for  an  existing  distribution,
                     specify false for IncludeCookies .

                 Bucket -> (string)
                     The Amazon S3 bucket to store the access logs in, for ex-
                     ample, myawslogbucket.s3.amazonaws.com .

                 Prefix -> (string)
                     An optional string that you want CloudFront to prefix  to
                     the access log filenames for this distribution, for exam-
                     ple, myprefix/ . If you want to enable logging,  but  you
                     don't want to specify a prefix, you still must include an
                     empty Prefix element in the Logging element.

              PriceClass -> (string)
                 The price class that corresponds with the maximum price  that
                 you want to pay for CloudFront service. If you specify Price-
                 Class_All , CloudFront responds to requests for your  objects
                 from all CloudFront edge locations.

                 If  you  specify  a  price  class other than PriceClass_All ,
                 CloudFront serves your objects from the CloudFront edge loca-
                 tion  that has the lowest latency among the edge locations in
                 your price class. Viewers who are in or near regions that are
                 excluded from your specified price class may encounter slower
                 performance.

                 For more information about price classes,  see  Choosing  the
                 Price  Class  for  a  CloudFront  Distribution  in the Amazon
                 CloudFront Developer Guide . For information about CloudFront
                 pricing,  including  how  price  classes (such as Price Class
                 100) map to CloudFront regions, see Amazon CloudFront Pricing
                 .

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 From  this field, you can enable or disable the selected dis-
                 tribution.

              ViewerCertificate -> (structure)
                 A complex type that determines the distributions SSL/TLS con-
                 figuration for communicating with viewers.

                 CloudFrontDefaultCertificate -> (boolean)
                     If  the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such
                     as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net , set this field to true
                     .

                     If  the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names
                     or CNAMEs), set this field to false  and  specify  values
                     for the following fields:

                     o ACMCertificateArn  or IAMCertificateId (specify a value
                       for one, not both)

                     o MinimumProtocolVersion

                     o SSLSupportMethod

                 IAMCertificateId -> (string)
                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs)  and  the  SSL/TLS  certificate  is stored in
                     Identity and Access Management (IAM) , provide the ID  of
                     the IAM certificate.

                     If you specify an IAM certificate ID, you must also spec-
                     ify values  for  MinimumProtocolVersion  and  SSLSupport-
                     Method .

                 ACMCertificateArn -> (string)
                     If  the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain names
                     or CNAMEs) and  the  SSL/TLS  certificate  is  stored  in
                     Certificate  Manager  (ACM) , provide the Amazon Resource
                     Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. CloudFront  only  sup-
                     ports  ACM  certificates in the US East (N. Virginia) Re-
                     gion (us-east-1 ).

                     If you specify an ACM  certificate  ARN,  you  must  also
                     specify values for MinimumProtocolVersion and SSLSupport-
                     Method .

                 SSLSupportMethod -> (string)
                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs),  specify  which viewers the distribution ac-
                     cepts HTTPS connections from.

                     o sni-only  The distribution  accepts  HTTPS  connections
                       from  only  viewers that support server name indication
                       (SNI) . This is recommended. Most browsers and  clients
                       support SNI.

                     o vip   The  distribution  accepts HTTPS connections from
                       all viewers including those that dont support SNI. This
                       is  not  recommended, and results in additional monthly
                       charges from CloudFront.

                     o static-ip - Do not specify this value unless your  dis-
                       tribution  has  been  enabled  for  this feature by the
                       CloudFront team. If you have a use case  that  requires
                       static  IP addresses for a distribution, contact Cloud-
                       Front through the Amazon Web Services Support Center .

                     If the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name  such
                     as  d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net  , dont set a value for
                     this field.

                 MinimumProtocolVersion -> (string)
                     If the distribution uses Aliases (alternate domain  names
                     or  CNAMEs),  specify  the  security policy that you want
                     CloudFront to use for HTTPS connections with viewers. The
                     security policy determines two settings:

                     o The minimum SSL/TLS protocol that CloudFront can use to
                       communicate with viewers.

                     o The ciphers that CloudFront can use to encrypt the con-
                       tent that it returns to viewers.

                     For  more  information, see Security Policy and Supported
                     Protocols and Ciphers Between Viewers and  CloudFront  in
                     the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                     NOTE:
                        On  the CloudFront console, this setting is called Se-
                        curity Policy .

                     When youre using SNI only (you  set  SSLSupportMethod  to
                     sni-only ), you must specify TLSv1 or higher.

                     If  the distribution uses the CloudFront domain name such
                     as d111111abcdef8.cloudfront.net (you  set  CloudFrontDe-
                     faultCertificate to true ), CloudFront automatically sets
                     the security policy to TLSv1 regardless of the value that
                     you set here.

              Restrictions -> (structure)
                 A  complex type that identifies ways in which you want to re-
                 strict distribution of your content.

                 GeoRestriction -> (structure)
                     A complex type that controls the countries in which  your
                     content  is  distributed. CloudFront determines the loca-
                     tion of your users using MaxMind GeoIP databases.

                     RestrictionType -> (string)
                        The method that you want to use to restrict  distribu-
                        tion of your content by country:

                        o none : No geo restriction is enabled, meaning access
                          to content is not restricted by client geo location.

                        o blacklist : The Location elements specify the  coun-
                          tries in which you don't want CloudFront to distrib-
                          ute your content.

                        o whitelist : The Location elements specify the  coun-
                          tries  in  which  you  want CloudFront to distribute
                          your content.

                     Quantity -> (integer)
                        When geo restriction is enabled , this is  the  number
                        of  countries  in your whitelist or blacklist . Other-
                        wise, when it is not enabled, Quantity is 0 , and  you
                        can omit Items .

                     Items -> (list)
                        A  complex  type  that contains a Location element for
                        each country in which you want  CloudFront  either  to
                        distribute your content (whitelist ) or not distribute
                        your content (blacklist ).

                        The Location element is a two-letter, uppercase  coun-
                        try  code  for  a  country that you want to include in
                        your blacklist or whitelist . Include one Location el-
                        ement for each country.

                        CloudFront  and  MaxMind  both  use  ISO  3166 country
                        codes. For the current list of countries and the  cor-
                        responding  codes,  see ISO 3166-1-alpha-2 code on the
                        International Organization  for  Standardization  web-
                        site.  You  can  also refer to the country list on the
                        CloudFront console, which includes both country  names
                        and codes.

                        (string)

              WebACLId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier that specifies the WAF web ACL, if any,
                 to associate with this distribution. To  specify  a  web  ACL
                 created using the latest version of WAF, use the ACL ARN, for
                 example       arn:aws:wafv2:us-east-1:123456789012:global/we-
                 bacl/ExampleWebACL/473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a  . To
                 specify a web ACL created using WAF Classic, use the ACL  ID,
                 for example 473e64fd-f30b-4765-81a0-62ad96dd167a .

                 WAF  is  a web application firewall that lets you monitor the
                 HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to CloudFront, and
                 lets  you control access to your content. Based on conditions
                 that you specify, such as  the  IP  addresses  that  requests
                 originate from or the values of query strings, CloudFront re-
                 sponds to requests either with the requested content or  with
                 an  HTTP  403 status code (Forbidden). You can also configure
                 CloudFront to return a custom error page when  a  request  is
                 blocked.  For  more information about WAF, see the WAF Devel-
                 oper Guide .

              HttpVersion -> (string)
                 (Optional) Specify the maximum HTTP version(s) that you  want
                 viewers  to  use  to communicate with CloudFront. The default
                 value for new web distributions is http2 . Viewers that don't
                 support HTTP/2 automatically use an earlier HTTP version.

                 For  viewers  and CloudFront to use HTTP/2, viewers must sup-
                 port TLSv1.2 or later, and must support Server  Name  Indica-
                 tion (SNI).

                 For  viewers  and CloudFront to use HTTP/3, viewers must sup-
                 port TLSv1.3 and Server  Name  Indication  (SNI).  CloudFront
                 supports  HTTP/3  connection migration to allow the viewer to
                 switch networks without losing connection. For more  informa-
                 tion  about connection migration, see Connection Migration at
                 RFC 9000. For more information about  supported  TLSv1.3  ci-
                 phers,  see  Supported  protocols and ciphers between viewers
                 and CloudFront .

              IsIPV6Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If you want CloudFront to respond to IPv6 DNS  requests  with
                 an  IPv6 address for your distribution, specify true . If you
                 specify false , CloudFront responds to IPv6 DNS requests with
                 the  DNS response code NOERROR and with no IP addresses. This
                 allows viewers to submit a second request, for  an  IPv4  ad-
                 dress for your distribution.

                 In  general, you should enable IPv6 if you have users on IPv6
                 networks who want to access your content. However, if  you're
                 using  signed  URLs  or  signed cookies to restrict access to
                 your content, and if you're using a custom  policy  that  in-
                 cludes  the  IpAddress parameter to restrict the IP addresses
                 that can access your content, don't enable IPv6. If you  want
                 to  restrict access to some content by IP address and not re-
                 strict access to other content (or restrict access but not by
                 IP  address),  you can create two distributions. For more in-
                 formation, see Creating a Signed URL Using a Custom Policy in
                 the Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide .

                 If  you're  using an Route 53 Amazon Web Services Integration
                 alias resource record set to route traffic to your CloudFront
                 distribution,  you  need  to  create  a second alias resource
                 record set when both of the following are true:

                 o You enable IPv6 for the distribution

                 o You're using alternate domain names in the  URLs  for  your
                   objects

                 For more information, see Routing Traffic to an Amazon Cloud-
                 Front Web Distribution by Using Your Domain Name in the Route
                 53 Amazon Web Services Integration Developer Guide .

                 If you created a CNAME resource record set, either with Route
                 53 Amazon Web Services Integration or with another  DNS  ser-
                 vice, you don't need to make any changes. A CNAME record will
                 route traffic to your distribution regardless of the  IP  ad-
                 dress format of the viewer request.

          AliasICPRecordals -> (list)
              Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for an
              Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want  to  serve
              content  publicly  on  an alternate domain name, also known as a
              CNAME, that they've added to CloudFront.  AliasICPRecordal  pro-
              vides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs associated with distri-
              butions.

              For more information about ICP recordals, see Signup,  Accounts,
              and Credentials in Getting Started with Amazon Web Services ser-
              vices in China .

              (structure)
                 Amazon Web Services services in China customers must file for
                 an  Internet  Content Provider (ICP) recordal if they want to
                 serve content publicly on  an  alternate  domain  name,  also
                 known  as  a  CNAME,  that they've added to CloudFront. Alia-
                 sICPRecordal provides the ICP recordal status for CNAMEs  as-
                 sociated  with  distributions.  The status is returned in the
                 CloudFront response; you can't configure it yourself.

                 For more information about ICP  recordals,  see  Signup,  Ac-
                 counts,  and  Credentials  in Getting Started with Amazon Web
                 Services services in China .

                 CNAME -> (string)
                     A domain name associated with a distribution.

                 ICPRecordalStatus -> (string)
                     The Internet Content Provider (ICP) recordal status for a
                     CNAME.  The  ICPRecordalStatus is set to APPROVED for all
                     CNAMEs (aliases) in regions outside of China.

                     The status values returned are the following:

                     o APPROVED indicates that  the  associated  CNAME  has  a
                       valid ICP recordal number. Multiple CNAMEs can be asso-
                       ciated with a distribution, and CNAMEs  can  correspond
                       to  different  ICP recordals. To be marked as APPROVED,
                       that is, valid to use with China region, a  CNAME  must
                       have one ICP recordal number associated with it.

                     o SUSPENDED  indicates that the associated CNAME does not
                       have a valid ICP recordal number.

                     o PENDING indicates that CloudFront can't  determine  the
                       ICP  recordal  status  of the CNAME associated with the
                       distribution because there was an error  in  trying  to
                       determine  the  status. You can try again to see if the
                       error is resolved in which case CloudFront  returns  an
                       APPROVED or SUSPENDED status.

       Location -> (string)
          The  fully  qualified URI of the new distribution resource just cre-
          ated.

       ETag -> (string)
          The current version of the distribution created.
