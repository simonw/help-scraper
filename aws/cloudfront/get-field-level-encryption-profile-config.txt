NAME
       get-field-level-encryption-profile-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Get the field-level encryption profile configuration information.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-field-level-encryption-profile-config
          --id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          Get  the ID for the field-level encryption profile configuration in-
          formation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a CloudFront field-level encryption profile configuration

       The following example gets metadata about  the  CloudFront  field-level
       encryption profile with ID PPK0UOSIF5WSV , including its ETag:

          aws cloudfront get-field-level-encryption-profile-config --id PPK0UOSIF5WSV

       Output:

                              }
                          }

OUTPUT
       FieldLevelEncryptionProfileConfig -> (structure)
          Return the field-level encryption profile configuration information.

          Name -> (string)
              Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

          Comment -> (string)
              An  optional comment for the field-level encryption profile. The
              comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          EncryptionEntities -> (structure)
              A complex data type of encryption entities for  the  field-level
              encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and
              field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with  this
              key.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 Number  of  field  pattern  items in a field-level encryption
                 content type-profile mapping.

              Items -> (list)
                 An array of field patterns in a field-level  encryption  con-
                 tent type-profile mapping.

                 (structure)
                     Complex  data  type  for  field-level encryption profiles
                     that includes the encryption key and field pattern speci-
                     fications.

                     PublicKeyId -> (string)
                        The  public  key  associated with a set of field-level
                        encryption patterns, to be used  when  encrypting  the
                        fields that match the patterns.

                     ProviderId -> (string)
                        The provider associated with the public key being used
                        for encryption. This value must also be provided  with
                        the private key for applications to be able to decrypt
                        data.

                     FieldPatterns -> (structure)
                        Field patterns in  a  field-level  encryption  content

                        beginning  characters  followed by a wildcard (*). You
                        can't overlap field patterns. For example,  you  can't
                        have  both  ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are
                        case-sensitive.

                            The number of field-level  encryption  field  pat-
