LIST-ORIGIN-REQUEST-POLICIES()                  LIST-ORIGIN-REQUEST-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-origin-request-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of origin request policies.

       You  can  optionally apply a filter to return only the managed policies
       created by Amazon Web Services, or only the custom policies created  in
       your Amazon Web Services account.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-origin-request-policies
          [--type <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          A filter to return only the specified kinds of origin request  poli-
          cies. Valid values are:

          o managed   Returns  only the managed policies created by Amazon Web
            Services.

          o custom  Returns only the custom policies created  in  your  Amazon
            Web Services account.

          Possible values:

          o managed

          o custom

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of origin request policies. The response  includes  origin
          request policies in the list that occur after the marker. To get the
          next page of the list,  set  this  fields  value  to  the  value  of
          NextMarker from the current pages response.

       --max-items (string)
          The  maximum  number of origin request policies that you want in the
          response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
