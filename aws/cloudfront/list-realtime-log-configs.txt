LIST-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIGS()                        LIST-REALTIME-LOG-CONFIGS()



NAME
       list-realtime-log-configs -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets a list of real-time log configurations.

       You  can  optionally  specify the maximum number of items to receive in
       the response. If the total number of items in the list exceeds the max-
       imum  that  you  specify, or the default maximum, the response is pagi-
       nated. To get the next page of items, send a  subsequent  request  that
       specifies  the NextMarker value from the current response as the Marker
       value in the subsequent request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-realtime-log-configs
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--marker <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of real-time log configurations that you want  in
          the response.

       --marker (string)
          Use this field when paginating results to indicate where to begin in
          your list of real-time log  configurations.  The  response  includes
          real-time  log  configurations  in  the  list  that  occur after the
          marker. To get the next page of the list, set this fields  value  to
          the value of NextMarker from the current pages response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The maximum number of real-time log configurations requested.

          Items -> (list)
              Contains the list of real-time log configurations.

              (structure)

                     real-time log configuration.

                     (structure)

                            real-time  log data. The only valid value is Kine-
                            sis .

                               The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  Kinesis

                     A list of fields that are included in each real-time  log
                     record.  In  an  API response, the fields are provided in
                     the same order in which they are sent to the Amazon Kine-
                     sis data stream.

                     (string)

          IsTruncated -> (boolean)
              A  flag that indicates whether there are more real-time log con-
              figurations than are contained in this list.

          Marker -> (string)
              This parameter indicates where this list of real-time  log  con-
              figurations  begins. This list includes real-time log configura-
              tions that occur after the marker.

          NextMarker -> (string)
              If there are more items in the list than are in  this  response,
              this  element  is present. It contains the value that you should
              use in the Marker field of  a  subsequent  request  to  continue
              listing real-time log configurations where you left off.
