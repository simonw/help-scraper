NAME
       list-field-level-encryption-profiles -

DESCRIPTION
       Request  a  list of field-level encryption profiles that have been cre-
       ated in CloudFront for this account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-field-level-encryption-profiles
          [--marker <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --marker (string)
          Use this when paginating results to indicate where to begin in  your
          list  of profiles. The results include profiles in the list that oc-
          cur after the marker. To get the  next  page  of  results,  set  the
          Marker  to  the  value of the NextMarker from the current page's re-
          sponse (which is also the ID of the last profile on that page).

       --max-items (string)
          The maximum number of field-level encryption profiles  you  want  in
          the response body.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list CloudFront field-level encryption profiles

       The following example gets a list of the CloudFront field-level encryp-
       tion profiles in your AWS account:

          aws cloudfront list-field-level-encryption-profiles

       Output:

                 Comment -> (string)
                     An optional comment for the field-level  encryption  pro-
