OPTIONS
       --field-level-encryption-profile-config (structure)
          Request to update a field-level encryption profile.

          Name -> (string)
              Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

          Comment -> (string)
              An  optional comment for the field-level encryption profile. The
              comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          EncryptionEntities -> (structure)
              A complex data type of encryption entities for  the  field-level
              encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and
              field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with  this
              key.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 Number  of  field  pattern  items in a field-level encryption
                 content type-profile mapping.

              Items -> (list)
                 An array of field patterns in a field-level  encryption  con-
                 tent type-profile mapping.

                 (structure)
                     Complex  data  type  for  field-level encryption profiles
                     that includes the encryption key and field pattern speci-
                     fications.

                     PublicKeyId -> (string)
                        The  public  key  associated with a set of field-level
                        encryption patterns, to be used  when  encrypting  the
                        fields that match the patterns.

                     ProviderId -> (string)
                        The provider associated with the public key being used
                        for encryption. This value must also be provided  with
                        the private key for applications to be able to decrypt
                        data.

                     FieldPatterns -> (structure)
                        Field patterns in  a  field-level  encryption  content
                        type  profile  specify  the fields that you want to be
                        encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any
                        beginning  characters  followed by a wildcard (*). You
                        can't overlap field patterns. For example,  you  can't
                        have  both  ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are
                        case-sensitive.

                            The number of field-level  encryption  field  pat-

                            terns.

                            (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "Comment": "string",
            "EncryptionEntities": {
              "Quantity": integer,
              "Items": [
                {
                  "PublicKeyId": "string",
                  "ProviderId": "string",
                  "FieldPatterns": {
                    "Quantity": integer,
                    "Items": ["string", ...]
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --id (string)
          The ID of the field-level encryption profile request.

       --if-match (string)
          The value of the ETag header that you received when  retrieving  the
          profile identity to update. For example: E2QWRUHAPOMQZL .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a CloudFront field-level encryption profile

       The following example updates the field-level encryption  profile  with
       the  ID PPK0UOSIF5WSV. This example updates the profile's Name and Com-
       ment, and adds a second FieldPatterns item, by providing the parameters
       in a JSON file.

       To update a field-level encryption profile, you must have the profile's
       ID  and  ETag.  The   ID   is   returned   in   the   output   of   the
       create-field-level-encryption-profile                               and
       list-field-level-encryption-profiles commands.  To get  the  ETag,  use
       the                get-field-level-encryption-profile                or
       get-field-level-encryption-profile-config command.  Use the  --if-match
       option to provide the profile's ETag.

          aws cloudfront update-field-level-encryption-profile \
              --id PPK0UOSIF5WSV \
              --if-match E1QQG65FS2L2GC \
              --field-level-encryption-profile-config file://fle-profile-config.json

       The  file fle-profile-config.json is a JSON document in the current di-
       rectory that contains the following:

          {
              "Name": "ExampleFLEProfileUpdated",
              "CallerReference": "cli-example",

                          "ProviderId": "ExampleFLEProvider",
                          "FieldPatterns": {

                                  "ExampleSensitiveField",
                                  "SecondExampleSensitiveField"
                              ]
                          }
                      }
                  ]
              }
          }

       Output:
