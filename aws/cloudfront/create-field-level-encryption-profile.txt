SYNOPSIS
            create-field-level-encryption-profile
          --field-level-encryption-profile-config <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --field-level-encryption-profile-config (structure)
          The request to create a field-level encryption profile.

          Name -> (string)
              Profile name for the field-level encryption profile.

          CallerReference -> (string)
              A unique number that ensures that the request can't be replayed.

          Comment -> (string)
              An  optional comment for the field-level encryption profile. The
              comment cannot be longer than 128 characters.

          EncryptionEntities -> (structure)
              A complex data type of encryption entities for  the  field-level
              encryption profile that include the public key ID, provider, and
              field patterns for specifying which fields to encrypt with  this
              key.

              Quantity -> (integer)
                 Number  of  field  pattern  items in a field-level encryption
                 content type-profile mapping.

              Items -> (list)
                 An array of field patterns in a field-level  encryption  con-
                 tent type-profile mapping.

                 (structure)
                     Complex  data  type  for  field-level encryption profiles
                     that includes the encryption key and field pattern speci-
                     fications.

                     PublicKeyId -> (string)
                        The  public  key  associated with a set of field-level
                        encryption patterns, to be used  when  encrypting  the
                        fields that match the patterns.

                     ProviderId -> (string)
                        The provider associated with the public key being used
                        for encryption. This value must also be provided  with
                        the private key for applications to be able to decrypt
                        data.

                     FieldPatterns -> (structure)
                        Field patterns in  a  field-level  encryption  content
                        type  profile  specify  the fields that you want to be
                        encrypted. You can provide the full field name, or any
                        beginning  characters  followed by a wildcard (*). You
                        can't overlap field patterns. For example,  you  can't
                        have  both  ABC* and AB*. Note that field patterns are
                        case-sensitive.

                        Quantity -> (integer)
                            The number of field-level  encryption  field  pat-
                            terns.

                        Items -> (list)
                            An  array of the field-level encryption field pat-
                            terns.

                            (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "CallerReference": "string",
            "Comment": "string",
            "EncryptionEntities": {
              "Quantity": integer,
              "Items": [
                {
                  "PublicKeyId": "string",
                  "ProviderId": "string",
                  "FieldPatterns": {
                    "Quantity": integer,
                    "Items": ["string", ...]
                  }
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create a CloudFront field-level encryption profile

       The  following example creates a field-level encryption profile by pro-
       viding the parameters in a JSON file named fle-profile-config.json. Be-
       fore  you  can create a field-level encryption profile, you must have a
       CloudFront public key.  To create a  CloudFront  public  key,  see  the
       create-public-key command.

       For more information about CloudFront field-level encryption, see Using
       Field-Level Encryption to Help Protect Sensitive  Data  in  the  Amazon
       CloudFront Developer Guide.

          aws cloudfront create-field-level-encryption-profile \
              --field-level-encryption-profile-config file://fle-profile-config.json
