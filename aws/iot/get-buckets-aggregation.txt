NAME

DESCRIPTION
       Aggregates on indexed data with search queries pertaining to particular

SYNOPSIS
            get-buckets-aggregation
          [--index-name <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          --aggregation-field <value>
          [--query-version <value>]
          --buckets-aggregation-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The name of the index to search.

       --query-string (string)
          The search query string.

       --aggregation-field (string)
          The aggregation field.

       --query-version (string)
          The version of the query.

       --buckets-aggregation-type (structure)
          The basic control of the response shape and the  bucket  aggregation
          type to perform.

          termsAggregation -> (structure)
              Performs  an aggregation that will return a list of buckets. The
              list of buckets is a ranked list of the number of occurrences of
              an aggregation field value.

              maxBuckets -> (integer)
                 The  number  of buckets to return in the response. Default to
                 10.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          termsAggregation={maxBuckets=integer}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "termsAggregation": {
              "maxBuckets": integer
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       totalCount -> (integer)
          The total number of things that fit the query string criteria.

       buckets -> (list)
          The main part of the response with a list of  buckets.  Each  bucket
          contains a keyValue and a count .
              keyValue  : The aggregation field value counted for the particu-
              lar bucket.

              count : The number of documents that have that value.

          (structure)
              A count of documents that meets a specific aggregation criteria.

              keyValue -> (string)
                 The value counted for the particular bucket.

              count -> (integer)
                 The number of documents that have the value counted  for  the
                 particular bucket.
