NAME
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of audit mitigation action tasks that match the specified
       filters.

       Requires permission to access the  ListAuditMitigationActionsTasks  ac-
       tion.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: tasks

SYNOPSIS
            list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks
          [--audit-task-id <value>]
          [--finding-id <value>]
          [--task-status <value>]
          --start-time <value>
          --end-time <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --audit-task-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were  applied  to
          results for a specific audit.

       --finding-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were applied to a
          specific audit finding.

       --task-status (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that are in a specific
          state.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELED

       --start-time (timestamp)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that began on or after
          a specific date and time.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Specify this filter to limit results to tasks that were completed or
          canceled on or before a specific date and time.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list audit mitigation action tasks

       The  following  list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks  example  lists the
       mitigation actions that were applied to findings within  the  specified
       time period.

          aws iot list-audit-mitigation-actions-tasks \
              --start-time 1594157400 \
              --end-time 1594157430

       Output:

          {
              "tasks": [
                  {
                          "taskId": "0062f2d6-3999-488f-88c7-bef005414103",
                          "startTime": "2020-07-07T14:30:15.172000-07:00",
                      "taskStatus": "COMPLETED"
                  }
              ]
          }
