NAME
       list-job-executions-for-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the job executions for a job.

       Requires permission to access the ListJobExecutionsForJob action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-job-executions-for-job  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: executionSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-job-executions-for-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --status (string)
          The status of the job.

          Possible values:

          o QUEUED

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o REJECTED

          o REMOVED

          o CANCELED

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the jobs in your AWS account

       The following list-job-executions-for-job example  lists  all  jobs  in
       your AWS account, sorted by the job status.

          aws iot list-jobs

       Output:

          {
              "jobs": [
                  {
                      "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
                      "jobId": "example-job-01",
                      "targetSelection": "SNAPSHOT",
                      "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
                      "createdAt": 1560787022.733,
                      "lastUpdatedAt": 1560787026.294
                  }
              ]
          }

          (structure)
              Contains a summary of information about  job  executions  for  a
              specific job.

              thingArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the thing on which the job execution is running.

              jobExecutionSummary -> (structure)
                 Contains a subset of information about a job execution.

                 status -> (string)
                     The status of the job execution.

                 queuedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
                     tion was queued.

                 startedAt -> (timestamp)
                     The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job execu-
                     tion started.

                 lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)

                     tion was last updated.

                     lar device. It can be used later in commands which return
