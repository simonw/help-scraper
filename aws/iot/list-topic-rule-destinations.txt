LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()                  LIST-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATIONS()



NAME
       list-topic-rule-destinations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  all  the topic rule destinations in your Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       Requires permission to access the ListTopicRuleDestinations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-topic-rule-destinations is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: destinationSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-topic-rule-destinations
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your topic rule destinations

       The following list-topic-rule-destinations example lists all topic rule
       destinations that you have defined in the current AWS Region.

          aws iot list-topic-rule-destinations

       Output:

          {
              "destinationSummaries": [
                  {
                      "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "status": "ENABLED",
                      "httpUrlSummary": {
                          "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       destinationSummaries -> (list)
          Information about a topic rule destination.

          (structure)
              Information about the topic rule destination.

              arn -> (string)
                 The topic rule destination ARN.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                     IN_PROGRESS

                 A topic rule destination was created but has  not  been  con-
                 firmed.  You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination  .  Calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination
                 causes  a  new confirmation challenge to be sent to your con-
                 firmation endpoint.
                     ENABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is allowed. You can set status to DISABLED by calling Update-
                 TopicRuleDestination .
                     DISABLED

                 Confirmation was completed, and traffic to  this  destination
                 is  not allowed. You can set status to ENABLED by calling Up-
                 dateTopicRuleDestination .
                     ERROR

                 Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the  con-
                 firmation timed out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination for
                 details about the error. You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by
                 calling   UpdateTopicRuleDestination  .  Calling  UpdateTopi-
                 cRuleDestination causes a new confirmation  challenge  to  be
                 sent to your confirmation endpoint.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  and  time when the topic rule destination was cre-
                 ated.

              lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the topic rule  destination  was  last
                 updated.

              statusReason -> (string)
                 The  reason the topic rule destination is in the current sta-
                 tus.

              httpUrlSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the HTTP URL.

                 confirmationUrl -> (string)
                     The URL used to confirm ownership of  or  access  to  the
                     HTTP topic rule destination URL.

              vpcDestinationSummary -> (structure)
                 Information about the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

                 subnetIds -> (list)
                     The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

                     (string)

                 securityGroups -> (list)
                     The security groups of the VPC destination.
