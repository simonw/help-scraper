NAME
       search-index -

DESCRIPTION
       The query search index.

       Requires permission to access the SearchIndex action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            search-index
          [--index-name <value>]
          --query-string <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--query-version <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --index-name (string)
          The search index name.

       --query-string (string)
          The search query string. For more information about the search query
          syntax, see Query syntax .

       --next-token (string)
          The token used to get the next set of results, or null if there  are
          no additional results.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return at one time.

       --query-version (string)
          The query version.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To query the thing index

       The following search-index example queries  the  AWS_Things  index  for
       things that have a type of LightBulb.

          aws iot search-index \
              --index-name "AWS_Things" \
              --query-string "thingTypeName:LightBulb"
