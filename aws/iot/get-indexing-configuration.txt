GET-INDEXING-CONFIGURATION()                      GET-INDEXING-CONFIGURATION()



NAME
       get-indexing-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the indexing configuration.

       Requires permission to access the GetIndexingConfiguration action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-indexing-configuration
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the thing indexing configuration

       The following get-indexing-configuration example gets the current  con-
       figuration data for AWS IoT fleet indexing.

          aws iot get-indexing-configuration

       Output:

          {
              "thingIndexingConfiguration": {
                  "thingIndexingMode": "OFF",
                  "thingConnectivityIndexingMode": "OFF"
              },
              "thingGroupIndexingConfiguration": {
                  "thingGroupIndexingMode": "OFF"
              }
          }

       opers Guide.

OUTPUT
       thingIndexingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Thing indexing configuration.

          thingIndexingMode -> (string)
              Thing indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o REGISTRY  Your thing index contains registry data only.

              o REGISTRY_AND_SHADOW - Your thing index contains  registry  and
                shadow data.

              o OFF - Thing indexing is disabled.

          thingConnectivityIndexingMode -> (string)
              Thing connectivity indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o STATUS   Your thing index contains connectivity status. To en-
                able thing connectivity indexing, thingIndexMode must  not  be
                set to OFF.

              o OFF - Thing connectivity status indexing is disabled.

          deviceDefenderIndexingMode -> (string)
              Device Defender indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o VIOLATIONS   Your  thing index contains Device Defender viola-
                tions.  To  enable  Device  Defender  indexing,  deviceDefend-
                erIndexingMode must not be set to OFF.

              o OFF - Device Defender indexing is disabled.

              For  more  information  about  Device  Defender  violations, see
              Device Defender Detect.

          namedShadowIndexingMode -> (string)
              Named shadow indexing mode. Valid values are:

              o ON  Your thing index contains named shadow.  To  enable  thing
                named shadow indexing, namedShadowIndexingMode must not be set
                to OFF.

              o OFF - Named shadow indexing is disabled.

              vice.
