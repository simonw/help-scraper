LIST-AUDIT-FINDINGS()                                    LIST-AUDIT-FINDINGS()



NAME
       list-audit-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  findings (results) of a Device Defender audit or of the au-
       dits performed during a specified time period. (Findings  are  retained
       for 90 days.)

       Requires permission to access the ListAuditFindings action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-audit-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: findings

       Shorthand Syntax:

          deviceCertificateId=string,caCertificateId=string,cognitoIdentityPoolId=string,clientId=string,policyVersionIdentifier={policyName=string,policyVersionId=string},account=string,iamRoleArn=string,roleAliasArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "deviceCertificateId": "string",
            "caCertificateId": "string",
            "cognitoIdentityPoolId": "string",
            "clientId": "string",
            "policyVersionIdentifier": {
              "policyName": "string",
              "policyVersionId": "string"
            },
            "account": "string",
            "iamRoleArn": "string",
            "roleAliasArn": "string"
          }

       --start-time (timestamp)
          A filter to limit results to those found after the  specified  time.
          You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but
          not both.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          A filter to limit results to those found before the specified  time.
          You must specify either the startTime and endTime or the taskId, but
          not both.

       --list-suppressed-findings | --no-list-suppressed-findings (boolean)
          Boolean flag indicating whether only the suppressed findings or  the
          unsuppressed findings should be listed. If this parameter isn't pro-
          vided, the response will list both suppressed and unsuppressed find-
          ings.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To list all findings from an audit

       The following list-audit-findings example lists all  findings  from  an
       AWS IoT Device Defender audit with a specified task ID.

          aws iot list-audit-findings \
              --task-id a3aea009955e501a31b764abe1bebd3d

       Output:

          {
              "findings": []
          }

       Example 2: To list findings for an audit check type

       The  following  list-audit-findings example shows findings from AWS IoT
       Device Defender audits that ran between June 5, 2019 and June 19,  2019
       in  which  devices are sharing a device certificate. When you specify a
       check name, you must provide a start and end time.

          aws iot list-audit-findings \
              --check-name DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_SHARED_CHECK \
              --start-time 1559747125 \
              --end-time 1560962028
