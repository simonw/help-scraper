GET-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATION()                      GET-TOPIC-RULE-DESTINATION()



NAME
       get-topic-rule-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a topic rule destination.

       Requires permission to access the GetTopicRuleDestination action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-topic-rule-destination
          --arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The ARN of the topic rule destination.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get a topic rule destination

       The following get-topic-rule-destination example gets information about
       a topic rule destination.

          aws iot get-topic-rule-destination \
              --arn "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "topicRuleDestination": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                  "status": "DISABLED",
                  "httpUrlProperties": {
                      "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       topicRuleDestination -> (structure)
          The topic rule destination.

          arn -> (string)
              The topic rule destination URL.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                 IN_PROGRESS

              A topic rule destination was created but has not been confirmed.
              You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination  . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination causes a new con-
              firmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.
                 ENABLED

              Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this  destination  is
              allowed.  You  can set status to DISABLED by calling UpdateTopi-
              cRuleDestination .
                 DISABLED

              Confirmation was completed, and traffic to this  destination  is
              not  allowed.  You  can set status to ENABLED by calling Update-
              TopicRuleDestination .
                 ERROR

              Confirmation could not be completed, for example if the  confir-
              mation  timed  out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination for de-
              tails about the error. You can  set  status  to  IN_PROGRESS  by
              calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to  your
              confirmation endpoint.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the topic rule destination was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The  date  and time when the topic rule destination was last up-
              dated.

          statusReason -> (string)
              Additional details or reason why the topic rule  destination  is
              in the current status.

          httpUrlProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the HTTP URL.

              confirmationUrl -> (string)
                 The URL used to confirm the HTTP topic rule destination URL.

          vpcProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The security groups of the VPC destination.

                 (string)

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC.

              roleArn -> (string)
