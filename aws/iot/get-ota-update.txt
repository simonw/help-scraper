NAME
       get-ota-update -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets an OTA update.

       Requires permission to access the GetOTAUpdate action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-ota-update
          --ota-update-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ota-update-id (string)
          The OTA update ID.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              The protocol used to transfer the OTA update image. Valid values
              are [HTTP], [MQTT], [HTTP, MQTT]. When both HTTP  and  MQTT  are
              specified, the target device can choose the protocol.

              (string)

                 The rate of increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows
                 you to define an exponential rate increase for a job rollout.

                 baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                     The  minimum  number of things that will be notified of a
                     pending job, per minute, at the start of the job rollout.
                     This is the initial rate of the rollout.

                 incrementFactor -> (double)
                     The  rate  of  increase  for a job rollout. The number of
                     things notified is multiplied by this factor.

                     The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of  rollout

                     ter the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

                     numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                        When this number of things have been notified, it will

                     numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                        When this number of things have succeeded in their job
                        execution, it will initiate an increase in the rollout
                        rate.

          awsJobPresignedUrlConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration information for pre-signed URLs. Valid when proto-
              cols contains HTTP.

                 How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
                 are  60 - 3600, the default value is 1800 seconds. Pre-signed
                 URLs are generated when a request for the job document is re-
                 ceived.

              OUS), or will be complete after all those  things  specified  as
              targets have completed the OTA update (SNAPSHOT). If continuous,
              the OTA update may also be run on a thing when a change  is  de-
              tected  in  a  target.  For example, an OTA update will run on a
              thing when the thing is added to a target group, even after  the
              OTA update was completed by all things originally in the group.
