OPTIONS
       --job-template-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the job template. We recommend using a UUID.
          Alpha-numeric characters, "-", and "_" are valid for use here.

       --job-arn (string)
          The ARN of the job to use as the basis for the job template.

       --document-source (string)
          An S3 link to the job document to use in the template.  Required  if
          you don't specify a value for document .

          NOTE:
              If  the  job  document  resides  in an S3 bucket, you must use a
              placeholder link when specifying the document.

              The placeholder link is of the following form:
                 ${aws:iot:s3-presigned-url:https://s3.amazonaws.com/*bucket*
                 /*key* }

              where  bucket  is  your bucket name and key is the object in the
              bucket to which you are linking.

       --document (string)
          The job document. Required if you don't specify a  value  for  docu-
          mentSource .

       --description (string)
          A description of the job document.

       --presigned-url-config (structure)
          Configuration for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download
              files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are  stored.
              The  role  must  also  grant  permission for IoT to download the
              files.

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are  valid.  Valid  values
              are  60  -  3600,  the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed
              URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT  request  for  the
              job document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,expiresInSec=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "expiresInSec": long
          }

       --job-executions-rollout-config (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of things that will be notified of a pending
              job, per minute. This parameter allows you to  create  a  staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The  rate  of  increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for  a
                 job.

                 Amazon  Web  Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

              rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout  for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number  of notified things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of succeeded  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maximumPerMinute=integer,exponentialRate={baseRatePerMinute=integer,incrementFactor=double,rateIncreaseCriteria={numberOfNotifiedThings=integer,numberOfSucceededThings=integer}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {

                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The minimum percentage of  job  execution  failures  that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon  Web  Services  IoT Core supports up to two digits
                     after the decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99,  but  not
                     10.999).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer},{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer}]

            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"REJECTED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",

                "thresholdPercentage": double,
                "minNumberOfExecutedThings": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --timeout-config (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of  the job. A timer is started when the job execution status is set
          to IN_PROGRESS . If the job execution status is not set  to  another
          terminal  state  before  the timer expires, it will be automatically
          set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies the amount of time, in minutes,  this  device  has  to
              finish  execution  of this job. The timeout interval can be any-
              where between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes).  The  in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions for the job. Whenever  a  job  execution  remains  in  the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "inProgressTimeoutInMinutes": long
          }

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the job template.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            ...
          ]

       --job-executions-retry-config (structure)
          Allows you to create the criteria to retry a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The list of criteria that determines how many  retries  are  al-
              lowed for each failure type for a job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The type of job execution failures that  can  initiate  a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The  number of retries allowed for a failure type for the
                     job.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer},{failureType=string,numberOfRetries=integer}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "criteriaList": [
              {

              ...
            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobTemplateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the job template.

       jobTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.
