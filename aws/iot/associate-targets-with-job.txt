       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            associate-targets-with-job
          --targets <value>
          --job-id <value>
          [--comment <value>]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --targets (list)
          A list of thing group ARNs that define the targets of the job.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --comment (string)
          An optional comment string describing why  the  job  was  associated
          with the targets.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              --job-id "example-job-04"

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-04",
              "jobId": "example-job-04",
              "description": "example continuous job"
          }
