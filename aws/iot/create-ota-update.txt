OPTIONS
       --ota-update-id (string)
          The ID of the OTA update to be created.

       --description (string)
          The description of the OTA update.

       --targets (list)
          The devices targeted to receive OTA updates.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --protocols (list)
          The protocol used to transfer the OTA update image. Valid values are
          [HTTP], [MQTT], [HTTP, MQTT]. When both HTTP and MQTT are specified,
          the target device can choose the protocol.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            MQTT
            HTTP

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies  whether  the update will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or
          will be complete after all the things specified as targets have com-
          pleted  the update (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the update may also be
          run on a thing when a change is detected in a target.  For  example,
          an  update  will  run on a thing when the thing is added to a target
          group, even after the update was completed by all things  originally
          in the group. Valid values: CONTINUOUS | SNAPSHOT.

              minute.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The rate of increase for a job rollout.  This  parameter  allows
              you to define an exponential rate increase for a job rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The  rate of increase for a job rollout. The number of things
                 notified is multiplied by this factor.

                 The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout  for
                 a job.

                 Amazon  Web  Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     When this number of things have been  notified,  it  will
                     initiate an increase in the rollout rate.

                     When  this  number  of things have succeeded in their job
                     execution, it will initiate an increase  in  the  rollout
                     rate.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maximumPerMinute=integer,exponentialRate={baseRatePerMinute=integer,incrementFactor=double,rateIncreaseCriteria={numberOfNotifiedThings=integer,numberOfSucceededThings=integer}}

              are 60 - 3600, the default value  is  1800  seconds.  Pre-signed
              URLs  are  generated  when a request for the job document is re-
              ceived.

                     The  minimum  percentage  of  job execution failures that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up  to  two  digits
                     after  the  decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not
                     10.999).

          }

       --aws-job-timeout-config (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of the job. A timer is started when the job execution status is  set
          to  IN_PROGRESS  . If the job execution status is not set to another
          terminal state before the timer expires, it  will  be  automatically
          set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of  time, in minutes, this device has to
              finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can  be  any-
              where  between  1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions  for  the  job.  Whenever  a  job execution remains in the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

                        ify the signature that was generated  using  the  same
                        signature  algorithm. For example, FreeRTOS uses ECDSA
                        or RSA , so you can pass either of them based on which
                        was used for generating the signature.

              attributes -> (map)
                 A list of name-attribute pairs. They won't be sent to devices
                 as a part of the Job document.

                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",

            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create an OTA update for use with Amazon FreeRTOS

       The following create-ota-update example creates an AWS IoT OTAUpdate on
       a  target group of things or groups. This is part of an Amazon FreeRTOS
       over-the-air update which makes it  possible  for  you  to  deploy  new
       firmware images to a single device or a group of devices.
