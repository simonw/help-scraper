       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-on-demand-audit-task
          --target-check-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-check-names (list)
          Which  checks are performed during the audit. The checks you specify
          must be enabled for your account or an  exception  occurs.  Use  De-
          scribeAccountAuditConfiguration  to  see the list of all checks, in-
          cluding those that are enabled or UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration to
          select which checks are enabled.

          (string)
              An  audit  check  name. Checks must be enabled for your account.
              (Use DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration to see the  list  of  all
              checks, including those that are enabled or use UpdateAccountAu-
              ditConfiguration to select which checks are enabled.)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To start an audit right away

       The following start-on-demand-audit-task example starts an AWS IoT  De-
       vice Defender audit and performs three certificate checks.

          aws iot start-on-demand-audit-task \
              --target-check-names CA_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK REVOKED_CA_CERTIFICATE_STILL_ACTIVE_CHECK

       Output:

          {
              "taskId": "a3aea009955e501a31b764abe1bebd3d"
          }

       For  more  information,  see  Audit  Commands  in the AWS IoT Developer
