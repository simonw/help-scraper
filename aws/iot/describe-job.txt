NAME
       describe-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes a job.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeJob action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was created.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get detailed status for a job

       The following describe-job example gets detailed  status  for  the  job
       whose ID is example-job-01.

          aws iot describe-job \
              --job-id "example-job-01"

OUTPUT
       documentSource -> (string)
          An S3 link to the job document.

       job -> (structure)
          Information about the job.

          jobArn -> (string)
              An ARN identifying the job with  format  "arn:aws:iot:region:ac-
              count:job/jobId".

          jobId -> (string)
              The  unique identifier you assigned to this job when it was cre-
              ated.

          targetSelection -> (string)
              Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS),  or
              will  be  complete  after  all those things specified as targets
              have completed the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous,  the  job  may
              also  be  run  on a thing when a change is detected in a target.
              For example, a job will run on a device when  the  thing  repre-
              senting  the  device  is added to a target group, even after the
              job was completed by all things originally in the group.

              NOTE:
                 We recommend that you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot
                 jobs  for  dynamic  thing  group targets. By using continuous
                 jobs, devices that join the group receive the  job  execution
                 even after the job has been created.

          status -> (string)
              The  status  of  the  job, one of IN_PROGRESS , CANCELED , DELE-
              TION_IN_PROGRESS or COMPLETED .

          forceCanceled -> (boolean)
              Will be true if the job was canceled with the optional force pa-
              rameter set to true .

          reasonCode -> (string)
              If the job was updated, provides the reason code for the update.

          comment -> (string)
              If the job was updated, describes the reason for the update.

          targets -> (list)
              A list of IoT things and thing groups to which the job should be
              sent.

              (string)

          description -> (string)
              A short text description of the job.

          presignedUrlConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration for pre-signed S3 URLs.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to down-
                 load  files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are
                 stored. The role must also grant permission for IoT to  down-
                 load the files.

              expiresInSec -> (long)
                 How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
                 are 60 - 3600, the default value is 3600 seconds.  Pre-signed
                 URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
                 job document.

                 The maximum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing  job,  per  minute. This parameter allows you to create a
                 staged rollout.

              exponentialRate -> (structure)
                 The rate of increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows

                     pending job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This
                     parameter  allows you to define the initial rate of roll-
                     out.

                 incrementFactor -> (double)
                     The exponential factor to increase the  rate  of  rollout
                     for a job.

          abortConfig -> (structure)
              Configuration for criteria to abort the job.

              criteriaList -> (list)

                     thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                        The  minimum percentage of job execution failures that
                        must occur to initiate the job abort.

                        Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to two digits
                        after  the  decimal  (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but
                        not 10.999).

              processingTargets -> (list)
                 The target devices to which the job execution is being rolled
                 out. This value will be null after the job execution has fin-
                 ished rolling out to all the target devices.

                 (string)

              numberOfCanceledThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things that cancelled the job.

              numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)

              numberOfQueuedThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things that are awaiting execution of the job.

              numberOfInProgressThings -> (integer)
                 The number of things currently executing the job.

              numberOfRemovedThings -> (integer)
                 The  number of things that are no longer scheduled to execute
                 the job because they have been deleted or have  been  removed
                 from the group that was a target of the job.

              numberOfTimedOutThings -> (integer)
                 The  number of things whose job execution status is TIMED_OUT
                 .

          timeoutConfig -> (structure)
              Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its  exe-
              cution  of  the  job.  A timer is started when the job execution
              status is set to IN_PROGRESS . If the job  execution  status  is
              not  set  to another terminal state before the timer expires, it
              will be automatically set to TIMED_OUT .

              inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
                 Specifies the amount of time, in minutes, this device has  to
                 finish  execution  of  this  job. The timeout interval can be
                 anywhere between 1 minute and 7 days (1  to  10080  minutes).
                 The  in progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all
                 job executions for the job. Whenever a job execution  remains
                 in  the IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the
                 job execution will fail and switch to the terminal  TIMED_OUT
                 status.

          namespaceId -> (string)
              The  namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed
              job.

              When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services
              IoT  Core  sends  jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain
              the value in the following format.
                 $aws/things/*THING_NAME*     /jobs/*JOB_ID*     /notify-name-
                 space-*NAMESPACE_ID* /

              NOTE:
                 The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

          jobTemplateArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the job template used to create the job.

          jobExecutionsRetryConfig -> (structure)
              The configuration for the criteria to retry the job.

              criteriaList -> (list)
                 The list of criteria that determines how many retries are al-
                 lowed for each failure type for a job.

                 (structure)
                     The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed
                     for each failure type for a job.

                     failureType -> (string)
                        The type of job execution failures that can initiate a
                        job retry.

                     numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                        The number of retries allowed for a failure  type  for
                        the job.

          documentParameters -> (map)
              A key-value map that pairs the patterns that need to be replaced
              in a managed template job document schema. You can use  the  de-
              scription of each key as a guidance to specify the inputs during
              runtime when creating a job.

              NOTE:
                 documentParameters can only be used when creating  jobs  from
                 Amazon  Web  Services managed templates. This parameter can't
                 be used with custom job templates  or  to  create  jobs  from
                 them.
