CREATE-THING()                                                  CREATE-THING()



NAME
       create-thing -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  thing record in the registry. If this call is made multiple
       times using the same thing name and configuration, the call  will  suc-
       ceed.  If this call is made with the same thing name but different con-
       figuration a ResourceAlreadyExistsException is thrown.

       NOTE:
          This is a control plane operation. See Authorization for information
          about authorizing control plane actions.

       Requires permission to access the CreateThing action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          [--thing-type-name <value>]
          [--attribute-payload <value>]
          [--billing-group-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing to create.

          You  can't  change  a  thing's name after you create it. To change a
          thing's name, you must create a new thing, give it the new name, and
          then delete the old thing.

       --thing-type-name (string)
          The name of the thing type associated with the new thing.

       --attribute-payload (structure)
          The  attribute  payload,  which  consists  of up to three name/value
          pairs in a JSON document. For example:
              {\"attributes\":{\"string1\":\"string2\"}}

          attributes -> (map)
              A JSON string containing up to three key-value pair in JSON for-
              mat. For example:
                 {\"attributes\":{\"string1\":\"string2\"}}

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          merge -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  list  of attributes provided in the At-
              tributePayload is merged with the attributes stored in the  reg-
              istry, instead of overwriting them.

              To remove an attribute, call UpdateThing with an empty attribute
              value.

              NOTE:
                 The merge attribute is only valid when calling UpdateThing or
                 UpdateThingGroup .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          attributes={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},merge=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "attributes": {"string": "string"
              ...},
            "merge": true|false
          }

       --billing-group-name (string)
          The name of the billing group the thing will be added to.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To create a thing record in the registry

       The following create-thing example creates an entry for a device in the
       AWS IoT thing registry.

          aws iot create-thing \
              --thing-name SampleIoTThing

       Output:

          {
              "thingName": "SampleIoTThing",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2: 123456789012:thing/SampleIoTThing",
              "thingId": " EXAMPLE1-90ab-cdef-fedc-ba987EXAMPLE "
          }

       Example 2: To define a thing that is associated with a thing type

       The following create-thing example create a thing that has  the  speci-
       fied thing type and its attributes.

          aws iot create-thing \
              --thing-name "MyLightBulb" \
              --thing-type-name "LightBulb" \
              --attribute-payload "{"attributes": {"wattage":"75", "model":"123"}}"

       Output:

          {
              "thingName": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyLightBulb",
              "thingId": "40da2e73-c6af-406e-b415-15acae538797"
          }

       Thing Types in the AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       thingName -> (string)
          The name of the new thing.

       thingArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the new thing.

       thingId -> (string)
          The thing ID.
