LIST-SECURITY-PROFILES-FOR-TARGET()        LIST-SECURITY-PROFILES-FOR-TARGET()



NAME
       list-security-profiles-for-target -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Device Defender security profiles attached to a target (thing
       group).

       Requires permission to access the ListSecurityProfilesForTarget action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-security-profiles-for-target is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: securityProfileTargetMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-security-profiles-for-target
          [--recursive | --no-recursive]
          --security-profile-target-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --recursive | --no-recursive (boolean)
          If true, return child groups too.

       --security-profile-target-arn (string)
          The ARN of the target (thing group) whose attached security profiles
          you want to get.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the security profiles attached to a target

       The following list-security-profiles-for-target example lists  the  AWS
       IoT Device Defender security profiles that are attached to unregistered
       devices.

          aws iot list-security-profiles-for-target  \
              --security-profile-target-arn "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:all/unregistered-things"

       Output:

          {
              "securityProfileTargetMappings": [
                  {
                      "securityProfileIdentifier": {
                          "name": "Testprofile",
                          "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:securityprofile/Testprofile"
                      },
                      "target": {
                          "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:all/unregistered-things"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

       Guide.
