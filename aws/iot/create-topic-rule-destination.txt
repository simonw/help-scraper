SYNOPSIS
            create-topic-rule-destination
          --destination-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --destination-configuration (structure)
          The topic rule destination configuration.

          httpUrlConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration of the HTTP URL.

              confirmationUrl -> (string)
                 The URL IoT uses to confirm ownership of  or  access  to  the
                 topic rule destination URL.

          vpcConfiguration -> (structure)
              Configuration of the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The security groups of the VPC destination.

                 (string)

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a role that has permission to create and attach to
                 elastic network interfaces (ENIs).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          httpUrlConfiguration={confirmationUrl=string},vpcConfiguration={subnetIds=[string,string],securityGroups=[string,string],vpcId=string,roleArn=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "httpUrlConfiguration": {
              "confirmationUrl": "string"
            },
            "vpcConfiguration": {
              "subnetIds": ["string", ...],
              "securityGroups": ["string", ...],
              "vpcId": "string",
              "roleArn": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a topic rule destination

       The following create-topic-rule-destination  example  creates  a  topic
       rule destination for an HTTP endpoint.

          aws iot create-topic-rule-destination \
              --destination-configuration httpUrlConfiguration={confirmationUrl=https://example.com}

       Output:

          {
              "topicRuleDestination": {
                  "arn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:ruledestination/http/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                  "status": "IN_PROGRESS",
                  "statusReason": "Awaiting confirmation. Confirmation message sent on 2020-07-09T22:47:54.154Z; no response received from the endpoint.",
                  "httpUrlProperties": {
                      "confirmationUrl": "https://example.com"
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       topicRuleDestination -> (structure)
          The topic rule destination.

          arn -> (string)
              The topic rule destination URL.

          status -> (string)
              The status of the topic rule destination. Valid values are:
                 IN_PROGRESS

              A topic rule destination was created but has not been confirmed.
              You can set status to IN_PROGRESS by calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination causes a new  con-
              firmation challenge to be sent to your confirmation endpoint.
                 ENABLED

              Confirmation  was  completed, and traffic to this destination is
              allowed. You can set status to DISABLED by  calling  UpdateTopi-
              cRuleDestination .
                 DISABLED

              Confirmation  was  completed, and traffic to this destination is
              not allowed. You can set status to ENABLED  by  calling  Update-
              TopicRuleDestination .
                 ERROR

              Confirmation  could not be completed, for example if the confir-
              mation timed out. You can call GetTopicRuleDestination  for  de-
              tails  about  the  error.  You  can set status to IN_PROGRESS by
              calling UpdateTopicRuleDestination . Calling UpdateTopicRuleDes-
              tination  causes a new confirmation challenge to be sent to your
              confirmation endpoint.

          createdAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the topic rule destination was created.

          lastUpdatedAt -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the topic rule destination was  last  up-
              dated.

          statusReason -> (string)
              Additional  details  or reason why the topic rule destination is
              in the current status.

          httpUrlProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the HTTP URL.

              confirmationUrl -> (string)
                 The URL used to confirm the HTTP topic rule destination URL.

          vpcProperties -> (structure)
              Properties of the virtual private cloud (VPC) connection.

              subnetIds -> (list)
                 The subnet IDs of the VPC destination.

                 (string)

              securityGroups -> (list)
                 The security groups of the VPC destination.

                 (string)

              vpcId -> (string)
                 The ID of the VPC.

              roleArn -> (string)
