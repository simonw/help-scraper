LIST-SCHEDULED-AUDITS()                                LIST-SCHEDULED-AUDITS()



NAME
       list-scheduled-audits -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all of your scheduled audits.

       Requires permission to access the ListScheduledAudits action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-scheduled-audits  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: scheduledAudits

SYNOPSIS
            list-scheduled-audits
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

              "scheduledAudits": [
                  {
                      "scheduledAuditName": "AWSIoTDeviceDefenderDailyAudit",
                      "scheduledAuditArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduledaudit/AWSIoTDeviceDefenderDailyAudit",
                      "frequency": "DAILY"
                  },
                  {
                      "scheduledAuditName": "AWSDeviceDefenderWeeklyAudit",
                      "scheduledAuditArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduledaudit/AWSDeviceDefenderWeeklyAudit",
                      "frequency": "WEEKLY",
                      "dayOfWeek": "SUN"
                  }
              ]
          }

       scheduledAudits -> (list)
          The list of scheduled audits.

          (structure)
              Information about the scheduled audit.

              scheduledAuditName -> (string)
                 The name of the scheduled audit.

              scheduledAuditArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the scheduled audit.

              frequency -> (string)

              dayOfMonth -> (string)
                 The day of the month on which the scheduled audit is run  (if
                 the frequency is "MONTHLY"). If days 29-31 are specified, and
                 the month does not have that many days, the audit takes place
                 on the "LAST" day of the month.

              dayOfWeek -> (string)
                 The  day  of the week on which the scheduled audit is run (if
                 the frequency is "WEEKLY" or "BIWEEKLY").

       nextToken -> (string)
          A token that can be used to retrieve the next  set  of  results,  or
          null if there are no additional results.
