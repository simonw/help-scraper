DESCRIBE-AUDIT-TASK()                                    DESCRIBE-AUDIT-TASK()



NAME
       describe-audit-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Device Defender audit.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeAuditTask action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-task
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the audit whose information you want to get.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about an audit instance

       The following describe-audit-task example gets information about an in-
       stance of an AWS IoT Device Defender audit. If the audit  is  complete,
       summary statistics for the run are included in the results.

          aws iot describe-audit-task \
              --task-id a3aea009955e501a31b764abe1bebd3d
