LIST-THINGS()                                                    LIST-THINGS()



NAME
       list-things -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your things. Use the attributeName and attributeValue parameters
       to filter your things. For example, calling ListThings with  attribute-
       Name=Color  and attributeValue=Red retrieves all things in the registry
       that contain an attribute Color with the value Red .

       Requires permission to access the ListThings action.

       NOTE:
          You will not be charged for calling this API if an Access denied er-
          ror  is  returned.  You will also not be charged if no attributes or
          pagination token was provided in request and no pagination token and
          no results were returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-things  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: things

SYNOPSIS
            list-things
          [--attribute-name <value>]
          [--attribute-value <value>]
          [--thing-type-name <value>]
          [--use-prefix-attribute-value | --no-use-prefix-attribute-value]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --attribute-name (string)
          The attribute name used to search for things.

       --attribute-value (string)
          The attribute value used to search for things.

       --thing-type-name (string)
          The name of the thing type used to search for things.

       --use-prefix-attribute-value |  --no-use-prefix-attribute-value  (bool-
       ean)
          When  true  ,  the action returns the thing resources with attribute
          values that start with the attributeValue provided.

          When false , or not present, the action returns only the  thing  re-
          sources  with  attribute values that match the entire attributeValue
          provided.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       Example 2: To list the defined things that have a specific attribute

       The following list-things example displays a list of things  that  have
       an attribute named wattage.

              --attribute-name wattage

       Output:

          {
