NAME
       describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about an audit mitigation task that is used to apply
       mitigation actions to a set of audit findings. Properties  include  the
       actions being applied, the audit checks to which they're being applied,
       the task status, and aggregated task statistics.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          The unique identifier for the audit mitigation task.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To show the details of an audit mitigation actions task

       The  following describe-audit-mitigation-actions-task example shows the
       details for the specified task, where the ResetPolicyVersionAction  was
       applied  to  a  finding.  The results include when the task started and
       ended, how many findings were targeted (and the outcome), and the defi-
       nition of the action that is applied as part of this task.
