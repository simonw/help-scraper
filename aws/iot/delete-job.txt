DELETE-JOB()                                                      DELETE-JOB()



NAME
       delete-job -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a job and its related job executions.

       Deleting a job may take time, depending on the number of job executions
       created for the job and various other factors. While the job  is  being
       deleted, the status of the job will be shown as "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS".
       Attempting to delete or cancel a job whose  status  is  already  "DELE-
       TION_IN_PROGRESS" will result in an error.

       Only  10  jobs may have status "DELETION_IN_PROGRESS" at the same time,
       or a LimitExceededException will occur.

       Requires permission to access the DeleteJob action.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-job
          --job-id <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--namespace-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be deleted.

          After a job deletion is completed, you may reuse this jobId when you
          create a new job. However, this is not recommended, and you must en-
          sure that your devices are not using  the  jobId  to  refer  to  the
          deleted job.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional)  When  true, you can delete a job which is "IN_PROGRESS".
          Otherwise, you can only delete a job which is in  a  terminal  state
          ("COMPLETED"  or "CANCELED") or an exception will occur. The default
          is false.

          NOTE:
              Deleting a job which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause a device which
              is  executing  the job to be unable to access job information or
              update the job execution status. Use  caution  and  ensure  that
              each  device executing a job which is deleted is able to recover
              to a valid state.

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core  sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:
              The namespaceId feature is in public preview.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a job

       The following delete-job example deletes the specified job. By specify-
       ing  the  --force  option,  the  job  is  deleted even if the status is
       IN_PROGRESS.

          aws iot delete-job \
              --job-id "example-job-04" \
              --force

       This command produces no output.

       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
