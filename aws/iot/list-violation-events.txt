LIST-VIOLATION-EVENTS()                                LIST-VIOLATION-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-violation-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the Device Defender security profile violations discovered during
       the given time period. You can use filters  to  limit  the  results  to
       those  alerts  issued  for  a particular security profile, behavior, or
       thing (device).

       Requires permission to access the ListViolationEvents action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-violation-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: violationEvents

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The start time for the alerts to be listed.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end time for the alerts to be listed.

       --thing-name (string)
          A  filter  to  limit results to those alerts caused by the specified
          thing.

       --security-profile-name (string)
          A filter to limit results to those alerts generated by the specified
          security profile.

       --behavior-criteria-type (string)
          The criteria for a behavior.

          Possible values:

          o STATIC

          o STATISTICAL

          o MACHINE_LEARNING

       --list-suppressed-alerts | --no-list-suppressed-alerts (boolean)
          A list of all suppressed alerts.

       --verification-state (string)
          The verification state of the violation (detect alarm).

          Possible values:

          o FALSE_POSITIVE

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE

          o TRUE_POSITIVE

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the security profile violations during a time period

       The following list-violation-events example lists violations  that  oc-
       curred  between  June  5, 2019 and June 12, 2019 for all AWS IoT Device
       Defender security profiles for the current AWS account and AWS Region.

OUTPUT
       violationEvents -> (list)
          The security profile violation alerts issued for this account during
          the given time period, potentially filtered by security profile, be-
          havior violated, or thing (device) violating.

          (structure)
              Information  about  a  Device Defender security profile behavior
              violation.

              violationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the violation event.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the thing responsible for the violation event.

              securityProfileName -> (string)
                 The name of the security profile whose behavior was violated.

              behavior -> (structure)
                 The behavior that was violated.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name you've given to the behavior.

                 metric -> (string)
                     What is measured by the behavior.

                 metricDimension -> (structure)
                     The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example,
                     using  a  TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow down the
                     scope of the metric to only MQTT topics  where  the  name
                     matches  the  pattern  specified  in  the dimension. This
                     can't be used with custom metrics.

                     dimensionName -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the dimension.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are in-
                        terpreted.  For example, for dimension type TOPIC_FIL-
                        TER, the IN operator, a message will be  counted  only
                        if  its  topic  matches one of the topic filters. With
                        NOT_IN operator, a message will be counted only if  it
                        doesn't  match  any of the topic filters. The operator
                        is optional: if it's not provided (is null ), it  will
                        be interpreted as IN .

                 criteria -> (structure)
                     The  criteria that determine if a device is behaving nor-
                     mally in regard to the metric .

                     comparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator that relates the thing measured (metric )
                        to  the  criteria  (containing  a  value  or statisti-
                        calThreshold ). Valid operators include:

                        o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                        o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than
                          , and greater-than-equals

                     value -> (structure)
                        The value to be compared with the metric .

                        count -> (long)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a numeric
                            value, use this to specify that numeric  value  to
                            be compared with the metric .

                        cidrs -> (list)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set of
                            CIDRs, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (string)

                        ports -> (list)
                            If  the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set of
                            ports, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (integer)

                        number -> (double)
                            The numeral value of a metric.

                        numbers -> (list)
                            The numeral values of a metric.

                            (double)

                        strings -> (list)
                            The string values of a metric.

                            (string)

                     durationSeconds -> (integer)
                        Use  this  to specify the time duration over which the
                        behavior is evaluated, for those criteria that have  a
                        time  dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ). For
                        a statisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison,  measure-
                        ments  from all devices are accumulated over this time
                        duration before being used to  calculate  percentiles,
                        and  later, measurements from an individual device are
                        also accumulated over this time duration before  being
                        given   a   percentile   rank.  Cannot  be  used  with
                        list-based metric datatypes.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                        If a device is in violation of the  behavior  for  the
                        specified  number  of consecutive datapoints, an alarm

                        threshold value by which a behavior is  determined  to
                        be in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                            Metrics  are  collected  over the specified period
                            (durationSeconds ) from all reporting  devices  in
                            your account and statistical ranks are calculated.
                            Then, the measurements from a device are collected
                            over  the same period. If the accumulated measure-
                            ments from the device fall above or below (compar-
                            isonOperator  ) the value associated with the per-
                            centile specified, then the device  is  considered
                            to be in compliance with the behavior, otherwise a
                            violation occurs.

                 count -> (long)
                     If  the comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value, use
                     this to specify that numeric value to  be  compared  with
                     the metric .

                 cidrs -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of CIDRs, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (string)

                 ports -> (list)
                     If the comparisonOperator calls for a set of  ports,  use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (integer)
