REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()                                  REGISTER-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       register-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  a  device certificate with IoT. If you have more than one CA
       certificate that has the same subject field, you must  specify  the  CA
       certificate  that  was used to sign the device certificate being regis-
       tered.

       Requires permission to access the RegisterCertificate action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-certificate
          --certificate-pem <value>
          [--ca-certificate-pem <value>]
          [--set-as-active | --no-set-as-active]
          [--status <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-pem (string)
          The certificate data, in PEM format.

       --ca-certificate-pem (string)
          The CA certificate used to sign the device certificate being  regis-
          tered.

       --set-as-active | --no-set-as-active (boolean)
          A boolean value that specifies if the certificate is set to active.

       --status (string)
          The status of the register certificate request.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o INACTIVE

          o REVOKED

          o PENDING_TRANSFER

          o REGISTER_INACTIVE

          o PENDING_ACTIVATION

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a self signed device certificate

       The following register-certificate example registers the deviceCert.pem
       device certificate signed by the rootCA.pem CA certificate. The CA cer-
       tificate must be registered before you use it to register a self-signed
       device  certificate.  The self-signed certificate must be signed by the
       same CA certificate you pass to this command.

          aws iot register-certificate \
              --certificate-pem file://deviceCert.pem \
              --ca-certificate-pem file://rootCA.pem

       Output:

          {
              "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
              "certificateId": "488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142"
           }

OUTPUT
       certificateArn -> (string)
          The certificate ARN.

       certificateId -> (string)
          The certificate identifier.
