DESCRIPTION
       Configures  or reconfigures the Device Defender audit settings for this

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-account-audit-configuration
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--audit-notification-target-configurations <value>]
          [--audit-check-configurations <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the role that grants permission to
          IoT  to  access  information  about your devices, policies, certifi-
          cates, and other items as required when performing an audit.

       --audit-notification-target-configurations (map)
          Information about the targets to which audit notifications are sent.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Information about the targets to which audit  notifications  are
              sent.

              targetArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN  of  the target (SNS topic) to which audit notifica-
                 tions are sent.

              roleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the role that grants permission to send  notifica-
                 tions to the target.

              enabled -> (boolean)
                 True if notifications to the target are enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=targetArn=string,roleArn=string,enabled=boolean,KeyName2=targetArn=string,roleArn=string,enabled=boolean

          Where valid key names are:
            SNS

       JSON Syntax:

          {"SNS": {
                "targetArn": "string",
                "roleArn": "string",
                "enabled": true|false
              }
            ...}

       --audit-check-configurations (map)
          Specifies  which  audit checks are enabled and disabled for this ac-
          count. Use DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration to see the list of  all
          checks, including those that are currently enabled.

          Some data collection might start immediately when certain checks are
          enabled. When a check is disabled, any data collected so far in  re-
          lation to the check is deleted.

          You  cannot disable a check if it's used by any scheduled audit. You
          must first delete the check from the scheduled audit or  delete  the
          scheduled audit itself.

          On  the first call to UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration , this parame-
          ter is required and must specify at least one enabled check.

          key -> (string)
              An audit check name. Checks must be enabled  for  your  account.
              (Use  DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration  to  see the list of all
              checks, including those that are enabled or use UpdateAccountAu-
              ditConfiguration to select which checks are enabled.)

          value -> (structure)
              Which audit checks are enabled and disabled for this account.

              enabled -> (boolean)
                 True if this audit check is enabled for this account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=enabled=boolean,KeyName2=enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "enabled": true|false
              }
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To enable Amazon SNS notifications for audit notifications

       The following update-account-audit-configuration example enables Amazon
       SNS notifications for AWS  IoT  Device  Defender  audit  notifications,
       specifying a target and the role used to write to that target.

          aws iot update-account-audit-configuration \
              --audit-notification-target-configurations "SNS={targetArn=\"arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:ddaudits\",roleArn=\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/AWSIoTDeviceDefenderAudit\",enabled=true}"

       This command produces no output.

       Example 2: To enable an audit check

       The  following  update-account-audit-configuration  example enables the
       AWS  IoT  Device  Defender   audit   check   named   AUTHENTICATED_COG-
       NITO_ROLE_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK. You cannot disable an audit check if
       it is part of the targetCheckNames for one or more scheduled audits for
       the AWS account.

          aws iot update-account-audit-configuration \
              --audit-check-configurations "{\"AUTHENTICATED_COGNITO_ROLE_OVERLY_PERMISSIVE_CHECK\":{\"enabled\":true}}"

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information,  see  Audit  Commands  in the AWS IoT Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
