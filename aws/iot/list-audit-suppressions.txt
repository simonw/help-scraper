LIST-AUDIT-SUPPRESSIONS()                            LIST-AUDIT-SUPPRESSIONS()



NAME
       list-audit-suppressions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists your Device Defender audit listings.

       Requires permission to access the ListAuditSuppressions action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-suppressions  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: suppressions

OPTIONS
       --check-name (string)
          An audit check name. Checks must be enabled for your  account.  (Use
          DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration to see the list of all checks, in-
          cluding those that are enabled or  use  UpdateAccountAuditConfigura-
          tion to select which checks are enabled.)

       --resource-identifier (structure)
          Information that identifies the noncompliant resource.

          deviceCertificateId -> (string)
              The ID of the certificate attached to the resource.

          caCertificateId -> (string)
              The ID of the CA certificate used to authorize the certificate.

          cognitoIdentityPoolId -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool.

          clientId -> (string)
              The client ID.

          policyVersionIdentifier -> (structure)
              The version of the policy associated with the resource.

              policyName -> (string)
                 The name of the policy.

              policyVersionId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the version of the policy associated with the re-
                 source.

          account -> (string)
              The account with which the resource is associated.

          iamRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the IAM role that has overly permissive actions.

          roleAliasArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role alias that has overly permissive actions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          deviceCertificateId=string,caCertificateId=string,cognitoIdentityPoolId=string,clientId=string,policyVersionIdentifier={policyName=string,policyVersionId=string},account=string,iamRoleArn=string,roleAliasArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "deviceCertificateId": "string",
            "caCertificateId": "string",
            "cognitoIdentityPoolId": "string",
            "clientId": "string",
            "policyVersionIdentifier": {
              "policyName": "string",
              "policyVersionId": "string"
            },
            "account": "string",
            "iamRoleArn": "string",
            "roleAliasArn": "string"
          }

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Determines whether suppressions are listed in ascending order by ex-
          piration  date  or  not.  If  parameter  isn't  provided,  ascendin-
          gOrder=true .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
