LIST-ACTIVE-VIOLATIONS()                              LIST-ACTIVE-VIOLATIONS()



NAME
       list-active-violations -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  active violations for a given Device Defender security pro-
       file.

       Requires permission to access the ListActiveViolations action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-active-violations is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: activeViolations

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing whose active violations are listed.

       --security-profile-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Device Defender security profile for which viola-
          tions are listed.

       --behavior-criteria-type (string)
          The criteria for a behavior.

          Possible values:

          o STATIC

          o STATISTICAL

          o MACHINE_LEARNING

       --list-suppressed-alerts | --no-list-suppressed-alerts (boolean)
          A list of all suppressed alerts.

       --verification-state (string)
          The verification state of the violation (detect alarm).

          Possible values:

          o FALSE_POSITIVE

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE

          o TRUE_POSITIVE

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

          }

OUTPUT
       activeViolations -> (list)
          The list of active violations.

          (structure)
              Information about an active Device Defender security profile be-
              havior violation.

              violationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the active violation.

              thingName -> (string)
                 The name of the thing responsible for the active violation.

              securityProfileName -> (string)
                 The security profile with the behavior is in violation.

              behavior -> (structure)
                 The behavior that is being violated.

                 name -> (string)
                     The name you've given to the behavior.

                 metric -> (string)
                     What is measured by the behavior.

                 metricDimension -> (structure)
                     The dimension for a metric in your behavior. For example,
                     using a TOPIC_FILTER dimension, you can narrow  down  the
                     scope  of  the  metric to only MQTT topics where the name
                     matches the pattern  specified  in  the  dimension.  This
                     can't be used with custom metrics.

                     dimensionName -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the dimension.

                     operator -> (string)
                        Defines how the dimensionValues of a dimension are in-
                        terpreted. For example, for dimension type  TOPIC_FIL-
                        TER,  the  IN operator, a message will be counted only
                        if its topic matches one of the  topic  filters.  With
                        NOT_IN  operator, a message will be counted only if it
                        doesn't match any of the topic filters.  The  operator
                        is  optional: if it's not provided (is null ), it will
                        be interpreted as IN .

                 criteria -> (structure)
                     The criteria that determine if a device is behaving  nor-
                     mally in regard to the metric .

                     comparisonOperator -> (string)
                        The operator that relates the thing measured (metric )
                        to the  criteria  (containing  a  value  or  statisti-
                        calThreshold ). Valid operators include:

                        o string-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o number-list : in-set and not-in-set

                        o ip-address-list : in-cidr-set and not-in-cidr-set

                        o number : less-than , less-than-equals , greater-than
                          , and greater-than-equals

                     value -> (structure)
                        The value to be compared with the metric .

                        count -> (long)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  numeric
                            value,  use  this to specify that numeric value to
                            be compared with the metric .

                        cidrs -> (list)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set  of
                            CIDRs, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (string)

                        ports -> (list)
                            If the  comparisonOperator  calls  for  a  set  of
                            ports, use this to specify that set to be compared
                            with the metric .

                            (integer)

                        number -> (double)
                            The numeral value of a metric.

                        numbers -> (list)
                            The numeral values of a metric.

                            (double)

                        strings -> (list)

                     durationSeconds -> (integer)
                        Use this to specify the time duration over  which  the
                        behavior  is evaluated, for those criteria that have a
                        time dimension (for example, NUM_MESSAGES_SENT ).  For
                        a  statisticalThreshhold  metric  comparison, measure-
                        ments from all devices are accumulated over this  time
                        duration  before  being used to calculate percentiles,
                        and later, measurements from an individual device  are
                        also  accumulated over this time duration before being
                        given  a  percentile  rank.  Cannot   be   used   with
                        list-based metric datatypes.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                        If  a  device  is in violation of the behavior for the
                        specified number of consecutive datapoints,  an  alarm
                        occurs. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     consecutiveDatapointsToClear -> (integer)
                        If  an  alarm has occurred and the offending device is
                        no longer in violation of the behavior for the  speci-
                        fied  number  of  consecutive datapoints, the alarm is
                        cleared. If not specified, the default is 1.

                     statisticalThreshold -> (structure)
                        A statistical  ranking  (percentile)that  indicates  a
                        threshold  value  by which a behavior is determined to
                        be in compliance or in violation of the behavior.

                        statistic -> (string)
                            The percentile that resolves to a threshold  value
                            by which compliance with a behavior is determined.
                            Metrics are collected over  the  specified  period
                            (durationSeconds  )  from all reporting devices in
                            your account and statistical ranks are calculated.
                            Then, the measurements from a device are collected
                            over the same period. If the accumulated  measure-
                            ments from the device fall above or below (compar-
                            isonOperator ) the value associated with the  per-
                            centile  specified,  then the device is considered
                            to be in compliance with the behavior, otherwise a
                            violation occurs.

                     mlDetectionConfig -> (structure)
                        The configuration of an ML Detect

                        confidenceLevel -> (string)

                 count -> (long)
                     If  the comparisonOperator calls for a numeric value, use
                     this to specify that numeric value to  be  compared  with
                     the metric .

                 cidrs -> (list)
                     If  the  comparisonOperator calls for a set of CIDRs, use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (string)

                 ports -> (list)
                     If the comparisonOperator calls for a set of  ports,  use
                     this to specify that set to be compared with the metric .

                     (integer)
