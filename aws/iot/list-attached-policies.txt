LIST-ATTACHED-POLICIES()                              LIST-ATTACHED-POLICIES()



NAME
       list-attached-policies -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the policies attached to the specified thing group.

       Requires permission to access the ListAttachedPolicies action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-attached-policies is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: policies

SYNOPSIS
            list-attached-policies
          --target <value>
          [--recursive | --no-recursive]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target (string)
          The group or principal for which the policies will be listed.  Valid
          principals   are   CertificateArn   (arn:aws:iot:region   :accountId
          :cert/certificateId ), thingGroupArn (arn:aws:iot:region  :accountId
          :thinggroup/groupName ) and CognitoId (region :id ).

       --recursive | --no-recursive (boolean)
          When true, recursively list attached policies.

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list the policies attached to a group

       The  following  list-attached-policies  example lists the policies that
       are attached to the specified group.

          aws iot list-attached-policies \
              --target "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/LightBulbs"

       Output:

          {
              "policies": [
                  {
                      "policyName": "UpdateDeviceCertPolicy",
                      "policyArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:policy/UpdateDeviceCertPolicy"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list the policies attached to a device certificate

       The following list-attached-policies example lists the AWS IoT policies
       attached  to  the  device certificate. The certificate is identified by
       its ARN.

          aws iot list-attached-policies \
              --target arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142

       Output:

          {
              "policies": [
                  {
                      "policyName": "TemperatureSensorPolicy",
                      "policyArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:policy/TemperatureSensorPolicy"
                  }
              ]
          }
