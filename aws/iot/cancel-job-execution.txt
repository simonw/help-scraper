NAME
       cancel-job-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Cancels the execution of a job for a given thing.

       Requires permission to access the CancelJobExecution action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            cancel-job-execution
          --job-id <value>
          --thing-name <value>
          [--force | --no-force]
          [--expected-version <value>]
          [--status-details <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          The ID of the job to be canceled.

       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing whose execution of the job will be canceled.

       --force | --no-force (boolean)
          (Optional) If true the job execution will be canceled if it has sta-
          tus IN_PROGRESS or QUEUED, otherwise the job execution will be  can-
          celed  only  if it has status QUEUED. If you attempt to cancel a job
          execution that is IN_PROGRESS, and you do not set force  to  true  ,
          then  an InvalidStateTransitionException will be thrown. The default
          is false .

          Canceling a job execution which is "IN_PROGRESS", will cause the de-
          vice  to  be  unable to update the job execution status. Use caution
          and ensure that the device is able to recover to a valid state.

       --expected-version (long)
          (Optional) The expected current version of the job  execution.  Each
          time  you  update  the job execution, its version is incremented. If
          the version of the job execution stored in Jobs does not match,  the
          update  is  rejected  with  a VersionMismatch error, and an ErrorRe-
          sponse that contains the current job execution status  data  is  re-
          turned.  (This  makes  it  unnecessary  to  perform  a  separate De-
          scribeJobExecution request in order to obtain the job execution sta-
          tus data.)

       --status-details (map)
          A collection of name/value pairs that describe the status of the job
          execution. If not specified, the statusDetails  are  unchanged.  You
          can specify at most 10 name/value pairs.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To cancel a job execution on a device

       The following cancel-job-execution example cancels the execution of the
       specified job on a device.  If the job is not in the QUEUED state,  you
       must add the --force parameter.

          aws iot cancel-job-execution \
              --job-id "example-job-03" \
              --thing-name "MyRPi"

       This command produces no output.

       For  more  information, see Creating and Managing Jobs (CLI) in the AWS
       IoT Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       None
