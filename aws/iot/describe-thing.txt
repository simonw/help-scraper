DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about the specified thing.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeThing action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-thing
          --thing-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --thing-name (string)
          The name of the thing.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display detailed information about a thing

       The  following describe-thing example display information about a thing
       (device) that is defined in the AWS IoT registry for your AWS account.

          aws iot describe-thing
                 --thing-name "MyLightBulb"

       Output:

          {
              "defaultClientId": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingName": "MyLightBulb",
              "thingId": "40da2e73-c6af-406e-b415-15acae538797",
              "thingArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyLightBulb",
              "thingTypeName": "LightBulb",
              "attributes": {
                  "model": "123",
                  "wattage": "75"
              },
              "version": 1
          }

       For more information, see How to Manage Things with the Registry in the
       AWS IoT Developers Guide.

OUTPUT
       defaultClientId -> (string)
          The  default MQTT client ID. For a typical device, the thing name is
          also used as the default MQTT client ID. Although we dont require  a
          mapping  between  a thing's registry name and its use of MQTT client
          IDs, certificates, or shadow state, we recommend that you  choose  a
          thing name and use it as the MQTT client ID for the registry and the
          Device Shadow service.

          This lets you better organize your IoT fleet  without  removing  the
          flexibility of the underlying device certificate model or shadows.

       thingName -> (string)
          The name of the thing.

       thingId -> (string)
          The ID of the thing to describe.

       thingArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the thing to describe.

       thingTypeName -> (string)
          The thing type name.

       attributes -> (map)
          The thing attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       version -> (long)
          The current version of the thing record in the registry.

          NOTE:
              To  avoid  unintentional  changes to the information in the reg-
              istry, you can pass the version information in the  expectedVer-
              sion parameter of the UpdateThing and DeleteThing calls.

       billingGroupName -> (string)
          The name of the billing group the thing belongs to.
