DESCRIBE-JOB-TEMPLATE()                                DESCRIBE-JOB-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       describe-job-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns information about a job template.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-job-template
          --job-template-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-template-id (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       jobTemplateArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the job template.

       jobTemplateId -> (string)
          The unique identifier of the job template.

       description -> (string)
          A description of the job template.

       documentSource -> (string)
          An S3 link to the job document.

       document -> (string)
          The job document.

       createdAt -> (timestamp)
          The time, in seconds since the epoch, when the job template was cre-
          ated.

       presignedUrlConfig -> (structure)
          Configuration for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of an IAM role that grants grants permission to download
              files from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates are  stored.
              The  role  must  also  grant  permission for IoT to download the
              files.

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How long (in seconds) pre-signed URLs are  valid.  Valid  values
              are  60  -  3600,  the default value is 3600 seconds. Pre-signed
              URLs are generated when Jobs receives an MQTT  request  for  the
              job document.

       jobExecutionsRolloutConfig -> (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of a job.

          maximumPerMinute -> (integer)
              The  maximum number of things that will be notified of a pending
              job, per minute. This parameter allows you to  create  a  staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The  rate  of  increase for a job rollout. This parameter allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for  a
                 job.

                 Amazon  Web  Services IoT Core supports up to one digit after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

              rateIncreaseCriteria -> (structure)
                 The criteria to initiate the increase in rate of rollout  for
                 a job.

                 numberOfNotifiedThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number  of notified things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The threshold for number of succeeded  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       abortConfig -> (structure)
          The criteria that determine when and how a job abort takes place.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria that determine when and how to abort the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determine when and how a  job  abort  takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The minimum percentage of  job  execution  failures  that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon  Web  Services  IoT Core supports up to two digits
                     after the decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99,  but  not
                     10.999).

                 minNumberOfExecutedThings -> (integer)
                     The  minimum number of things which must receive job exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       timeoutConfig -> (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of  the job. A timer is started when the job execution status is set
          to IN_PROGRESS . If the job execution status is not set  to  another
          terminal  state  before  the timer expires, it will be automatically
          set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies the amount of time, in minutes,  this  device  has  to
              finish  execution  of this job. The timeout interval can be any-
              where between 1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes).  The  in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions for the job. Whenever  a  job  execution  remains  in  the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

       jobExecutionsRetryConfig -> (structure)
          The configuration that determines how many retries are  allowed  for
          each failure type for a job.

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The  list  of  criteria that determines how many retries are al-
              lowed for each failure type for a job.

              (structure)
                 The criteria that determines how many retries are allowed for
                 each failure type for a job.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  job execution failures that can initiate a
                     job retry.

                 numberOfRetries -> (integer)
                     The number of retries allowed for a failure type for  the
                     job.
