LIST-OUTGOING-CERTIFICATES()                      LIST-OUTGOING-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       list-outgoing-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists certificates that are being transferred but not yet accepted.

       Requires permission to access the ListOutgoingCertificates action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-outgoing-certificates is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: outgoingCertificates

SYNOPSIS
            list-outgoing-certificates
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--ascending-order | --no-ascending-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --ascending-order | --no-ascending-order (boolean)
          Specifies  the  order for results. If True, the results are returned
          in ascending order, based on the creation date.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list certificates being transferred to a different AWS account

       The following list-outgoing-certificates example lists all device  cer-
       tificates  that  are in the process of being transferred to a different
       AWS account using the transfer-certificate command.

          aws iot list-outgoing-certificates

       Output:

          {
              "outgoingCertificates": [
                  {
                      "certificateArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:030714055129:cert/488b6a7f2acdeb00a77384e63c4e40b18b1b3caaae57b7272ba44c45e3448142",
