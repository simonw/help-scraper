OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A  job  identifier which must be unique for your Amazon Web Services
          account. We recommend using a UUID.  Alpha-numeric  characters,  "-"
          and "_" are valid for use here.

       --targets (list)
          A list of things and thing groups to which the job should be sent.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --document-source (string)
          An  S3  link,  or S3 object URL, to the job document. The link is an
          Amazon S3 object URL and is required if you don't  specify  a  value
          for document .

          For  example,  --document-source  https://s3.*region-code*  .amazon-
          aws.com/example-firmware/device-firmware.1.0

          For more information, see Methods for accessing a bucket .

       --document (string)
          The job document. Required if you don't specify a  value  for  docu-
          mentSource .

       --description (string)
          A short text description of the job.

       --presigned-url-config (structure)
          Configuration information for pre-signed S3 URLs.

          roleArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of an IAM role that grants permission to download files
              from the S3 bucket where the job data/updates  are  stored.  The
              role must also grant permission for IoT to download the files.

              WARNING:
                 For information about addressing the confused deputy problem,
                 see cross-service confused deputy prevention  in  the  Amazon
                 Web Services IoT Core developer guide .

          expiresInSec -> (long)
              How  long  (in  seconds) pre-signed URLs are valid. Valid values
              are 60 - 3600, the default value  is  3600  seconds.  Pre-signed
              URLs  are  generated  when Jobs receives an MQTT request for the
              job document.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          roleArn=string,expiresInSec=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "roleArn": "string",
            "expiresInSec": long
          }

       --target-selection (string)
          Specifies whether the job will continue to run (CONTINUOUS), or will
          be  complete  after  all those things specified as targets have com-
          pleted the job (SNAPSHOT). If continuous, the job may also be run on
          a  thing  when  a change is detected in a target. For example, a job
          will run on a thing when the thing is added to a target group,  even
          after the job was completed by all things originally in the group.

          NOTE:
              We  recommend  that  you use continuous jobs instead of snapshot
              jobs for dynamic thing group targets. By using continuous  jobs,
              devices that join the group receive the job execution even after
              the job has been created.

          Possible values:

          o CONTINUOUS

          o SNAPSHOT

       --job-executions-rollout-config (structure)
          Allows you to create a staged rollout of the job.

              The maximum number of things that will be notified of a  pending
              job,  per  minute.  This parameter allows you to create a staged
              rollout.

          exponentialRate -> (structure)
              The rate of increase for a job rollout.  This  parameter  allows
              you to define an exponential rate for a job rollout.

              baseRatePerMinute -> (integer)
                 The minimum number of things that will be notified of a pend-
                 ing job, per minute at the start of job rollout. This parame-
                 ter allows you to define the initial rate of rollout.

              incrementFactor -> (double)
                 The  exponential factor to increase the rate of rollout for a
                 job.

                 Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up to one  digit  after
                 the decimal (for example, 1.5, but not 1.55).

                     The threshold for number of  notified  things  that  will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

                 numberOfSucceededThings -> (integer)
                     The  threshold  for  number of succeeded things that will
                     initiate the increase in rate of rollout.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          maximumPerMinute=integer,exponentialRate={baseRatePerMinute=integer,incrementFactor=double,rateIncreaseCriteria={numberOfNotifiedThings=integer,numberOfSucceededThings=integer}}

          criteriaList -> (list)
              The list of criteria that determine when and how  to  abort  the
              job.

              (structure)
                 The  criteria  that  determine when and how a job abort takes
                 place.

                 failureType -> (string)
                     The type of job execution failures that  can  initiate  a
                     job abort.

                 action -> (string)
                     The type of job action to take to initiate the job abort.

                 thresholdPercentage -> (double)
                     The  minimum  percentage  of  job execution failures that
                     must occur to initiate the job abort.

                     Amazon Web Services IoT Core supports up  to  two  digits
                     after  the  decimal (for example, 10.9 and 10.99, but not
                     10.999).

                     The minimum number of things which must receive job  exe-
                     cution notifications before the job can be aborted.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          criteriaList=[{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer},{failureType=string,action=string,thresholdPercentage=double,minNumberOfExecutedThings=integer}]

            "criteriaList": [
              {
                "failureType": "FAILED"|"REJECTED"|"TIMED_OUT"|"ALL",
                "action": "CANCEL",
                "thresholdPercentage": double,
                "minNumberOfExecutedThings": integer
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --timeout-config (structure)
          Specifies the amount of time each device has to finish its execution
          of the job. The timer is started when the job  execution  status  is
          set  to  IN_PROGRESS . If the job execution status is not set to an-
          other terminal state before the time expires, it will  be  automati-
          cally set to TIMED_OUT .

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes -> (long)
              Specifies  the  amount  of  time, in minutes, this device has to
              finish execution of this job. The timeout interval can  be  any-
              where  between  1 minute and 7 days (1 to 10080 minutes). The in
              progress timer can't be updated and will apply to all job execu-
              tions  for  the  job.  Whenever  a  job execution remains in the
              IN_PROGRESS status for longer than this interval, the job execu-
              tion will fail and switch to the terminal TIMED_OUT status.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          inProgressTimeoutInMinutes=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "inProgressTimeoutInMinutes": long

            }
            ...
          ]

       --namespace-id (string)
          The namespace used to indicate that a job is a customer-managed job.

          When you specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Web Services IoT
          Core sends jobs notifications to MQTT topics that contain the  value
          in the following format.
              $aws/things/*THING_NAME* /jobs/*JOB_ID* /notify-namespace-*NAME-
              SPACE_ID* /

          NOTE:

              The time a job will begin rollout of the job document to all de-
              vices in the target group for a job. The startTime can be sched-
              uled  up to a year in advance and must be scheduled a minimum of
              thirty minutes from the current time. The date and  time  format
              for  the  startTime is YYYY-MM-DD for the date and HH:MM for the
              time.

              API command or the Command Line Interface, see Timestamp .

          endTime -> (string)
              The  time a job will stop rollout of the job document to all de-
              vices in the target group for a job. The endTime must take place
              no later than two years from the current time and be scheduled a
              minimum of thirty minutes from the current time. The minimum du-
              ration between startTime and endTime is thirty minutes. The max-
              imum duration between startTime and endTime is  two  years.  The
              date  and time format for the endTime is YYYY-MM-DD for the date
              and HH:MM for the time.

              For more information on the syntax for endTime when using an API
              command or the Command Line Interface, see Timestamp .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To create a job

       The  following  create-job  example  creates  a simple AWS IoT job that
       sends a JSON document to the MyRaspberryPi device.

          aws iot create-job \
              --job-id "example-job-01" \
              --targets "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thing/MyRaspberryPi" \
              --document file://example-job.json \
              --description "example job test" \
              --target-selection SNAPSHOT

       Output:

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-01",
              "jobId": "example-job-01",
              "description": "example job test"
          }

       Example 2: To create a continuous job

       The following create-job example creates a job that  continues  to  run
       after  the  things specified as targets have completed the job. In this
       example, the target is a thing group, so when new devices are added  to
       the group, the continuous job runs on those new things.

          aws iot create-job
                 --job-id              "example-job-04"              --targets
                 "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:thinggroup/DeadBulbs"
                 --document   file://example-job.json  --description  "example
                 continuous job" --target-selection CONTINUOUS

       Output:

          {
              "jobArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:job/example-job-04",
              "jobId": "example-job-04",
              "description": "example continuous job"
          }

       For more information, see Creating and Managing Jobs (CLI) in  the  AWS
       IoT Developer Guide.
