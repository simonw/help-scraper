LIST-AUDIT-MITIGATION-ACTIONS-EXECUTLIST-AUDIT-MITIGATION-ACTIONS-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the status of audit mitigation action tasks that were executed.

       Requires  permission to access the ListAuditMitigationActionsExecutions
       action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions is a paginated operation. Mul-
       tiple  API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set
       of results. You can disable pagination by providing  the  --no-paginate
       argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: actionsExecutions

SYNOPSIS
            list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions
          --task-id <value>
          [--action-status <value>]
          --finding-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to actions for a specific audit
          mitigation actions task.

       --action-status (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to those with a  specific  sta-
          tus.

          Possible values:

          o IN_PROGRESS

          o COMPLETED

          o FAILED

          o CANCELED

          o SKIPPED

          o PENDING

       --finding-id (string)
          Specify this filter to limit results to those that were applied to a
          specific audit finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the details of an audit mitigation action execution

       An  audit  mitigation action task applies a mitigation action to one or
       more findings from an AWS IoT  Device  Defender  audit.  The  following
       list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions  example lists the details for
       the mitigation action task with the specified taskId and for the speci-
       fied finding.

          aws iot list-audit-mitigation-actions-executions \
              --task-id myActionsTaskId \
              --finding-id 0edbaaec-2fe1-4cf5-abc9-d4c3e51f7464

       Output:

          {
              "actionsExecutions": [
                  {
                      "taskId": "myActionsTaskId",
                      "findingId": "0edbaaec-2fe1-4cf5-abc9-d4c3e51f7464",
                      "actionName": "ResetPolicyVersionAction",
                      "actionId": "1ea0b415-bef1-4a01-bd13-72fb63c59afb",
                      "status": "COMPLETED",
                      "startTime": "2019-12-10T15:19:13.279000-08:00",
                      "endTime": "2019-12-10T15:19:13.337000-08:00"
                  }
              ]
          }
