DESCRIBE-AUDIT-FINDING()                              DESCRIBE-AUDIT-FINDING()



NAME
       describe-audit-finding -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  information  about a single audit finding. Properties include the
       reason for noncompliance, the severity of the issue, and the start time
       when the audit that returned the finding.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeAuditFinding action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-audit-finding
          --finding-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --finding-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  a single audit finding. You can use this
          identifier to apply mitigation actions to the finding.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list details for an audit finding

       The  following describe-audit-finding example lists the details for the
       specified AWS IoT Device Defender audit finding. An audit  can  produce
       multiple findings. Use the list-audit-findings command to get a list of
       the findings from an audit to get the findingId.

          aws iot describe-audit-finding \
              --finding-id "ef4826b8-e55a-44b9-b460-5c485355371b"
