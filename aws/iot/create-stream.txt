CREATE-STREAM()                                                CREATE-STREAM()



NAME
       create-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a stream for delivering one or more large files in chunks over
       MQTT. A stream transports data bytes in chunks or  blocks  packaged  as
       MQTT messages from a source like S3. You can have one or more files as-
       sociated with a stream.

       Requires permission to access the CreateStream action.

          (structure)
              Represents a file to stream.

              fileId -> (integer)
                 The file ID.

              s3Location -> (structure)

                 version -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          fileId=integer,s3Location={bucket=string,key=string,version=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "fileId": integer,
              "s3Location": {
                "bucket": "string",
                "key": "string",
                "version": "string"
              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --role-arn (string)
          An IAM role that allows the IoT service principal to access your  S3
          files.

       --tags (list)
          Metadata which can be used to manage streams.

          (structure)
              A set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To  create  a  stream  for delivering one or more large files in chunks
       over MQTT

       The following create-stream example creates a stream for delivering one
       or more large files in chunks over MQTT. A stream transports data bytes
       in chunks or blocks packaged as MQTT messages from a  source  like  S3.
       You can have one or more files associated with a stream.
