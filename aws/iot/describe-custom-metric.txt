DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-METRIC()                              DESCRIBE-CUSTOM-METRIC()



NAME
       describe-custom-metric -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets information about a Device Defender detect custom metric.

       Requires permission to access the DescribeCustomMetric action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-custom-metric
          --metric-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --metric-name (string)
          The name of the custom metric.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a Device Defender custom metric

       The following describe-custom-metric example gets information  about  a
       custom metric named myCustomMetric.

          aws iot describe-custom-metric \
              --metric-name myCustomMetric

       Output:

          {
              "metricName": "myCustomMetric",
              "metricArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:1234564789012:custommetric/myCustomMetric",
              "metricType": "number",
              "displayName": "My custom metric",
              "creationDate": 2020-11-17T23:02:12.879000-09:00,
              "lastModifiedDate": 2020-11-17T23:02:12.879000-09:00
          }

       For  more information, see Custom metrics in the AWS IoT Core Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       metricName -> (string)
          The name of the custom metric.

       metricArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the custom metric.

       metricType -> (string)
          The type of the custom metric.

          WARNING:
              The type number only takes a single metric value  as  an  input,
              but  while submitting the metrics value in the DeviceMetrics re-
              port, it must be passed as an array with a single value.

       displayName -> (string)
          Field represents a friendly name in the console for the custom  met-
          ric;  doesn't  have  to be unique. Don't use this name as the metric
          identifier in the device metric report. Can be updated.

       creationDate -> (timestamp)
          The creation date of the custom metric in milliseconds since epoch.

       lastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)
          The time the custom metric was last modified in  milliseconds  since
          epoch.
