SYNOPSIS
            create-scheduled-audit
          --frequency <value>
          [--day-of-month <value>]
          [--day-of-week <value>]
          --target-check-names <value>
          --scheduled-audit-name <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --frequency (string)
          How  often  the scheduled audit takes place, either DAILY , WEEKLY ,
          BIWEEKLY or MONTHLY . The start time of each audit is determined  by
          the system.

          Possible values:

          o MONTHLY

       --day-of-month (string)
          The  day of the month on which the scheduled audit takes place. This
          can be "1" through "31" or "LAST". This field  is  required  if  the
          "frequency" parameter is set to MONTHLY . If days 29 to 31 are spec-
          ified, and the month doesn't have that many days,  the  audit  takes
          place on the LAST day of the month.

       --day-of-week (string)
          The day of the week on which the scheduled audit takes place, either
          SUN , MON , TUE , WED , THU , FRI , or SAT . This field is  required
          if the frequency parameter is set to WEEKLY or BIWEEKLY .

          Possible values:

          o MON

          o TUE

          o WED

          o THU

          o FRI

          o SAT

       --target-check-names (list)
          Which  checks  are performed during the scheduled audit. Checks must
          be enabled for your account. (Use  DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration
          to  see  the list of all checks, including those that are enabled or
          use UpdateAccountAuditConfiguration to select which checks  are  en-
          abled.)

          (string)
              An  audit  check  name. Checks must be enabled for your account.
              (Use DescribeAccountAuditConfiguration to see the  list  of  all
              checks, including those that are enabled or use UpdateAccountAu-
              ditConfiguration to select which checks are enabled.)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --scheduled-audit-name (string)
          The name you want to give to the scheduled audit. (Max. 128 chars)

       --tags (list)
          Metadata that can be used to manage the scheduled audit.

          (structure)
              A set of key/value pairs that are used to manage the resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 The tag's key.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a scheduled audit

       The following create-scheduled-audit example creates a scheduled  audit
       that  runs  weekly, on Wednesday, to check if CA certificates or device
       certificates are expiring.

          aws iot create-scheduled-audit \
              --scheduled-audit-name WednesdayCertCheck \
              --frequency WEEKLY \
              --day-of-week WED \
              --target-check-names CA_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK DEVICE_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRING_CHECK

       Output:

          {
              "scheduledAuditArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-west-2:123456789012:scheduledaudit/WednesdayCertCheck"
          }

       For more information, see Audit  Commands  in  the  AWS  IoT  Developer
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       scheduledAuditArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the scheduled audit.
