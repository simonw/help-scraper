LIST-V2-LOGGING-LEVELS()                              LIST-V2-LOGGING-LEVELS()



NAME
       list-v2-logging-levels -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists logging levels.

       Requires permission to access the ListV2LoggingLevels action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-v2-logging-levels is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: logTargetConfigurations

SYNOPSIS
            list-v2-logging-levels
          [--target-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --target-type (string)
          The type of resource for which you are configuring logging. Must  be
          THING_Group .

          Possible values:

          o DEFAULT

          o THING_GROUP

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list logging levels

       The  following list-v2-logging-levels example lists the configured log-
       ging levels. If logging levels were not set,  a  NotConfiguredException
       occurs when you run this command.

          aws iot list-v2-logging-levels

       Output:

          {
              "logTargetConfigurations": [
                  {
                      "logTarget": {
                          "targetType": "DEFAULT"
                      },
                      "logLevel": "ERROR"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       logTargetConfigurations -> (list)
          The logging configuration for a target.

          (structure)
              The target configuration.

              logTarget -> (structure)
                 A log target

                 targetType -> (string)
                     The target type.

                 targetName -> (string)
                     The target name.

              logLevel -> (string)
                 The logging level.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The  token  to  use to get the next set of results, or null if there
          are no additional results.
