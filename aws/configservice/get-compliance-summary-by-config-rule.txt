NAME
       get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the number of Config rules that are compliant and noncompliant,
       up to a maximum of 25 for each.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get the compliance summary for your AWS Config rules

       The following command returns the number of rules  that  are  compliant
       and the number that are noncompliant:

          aws configservice get-compliance-summary-by-config-rule

       In  the  output, the value for each CappedCount attribute indicates how
       many rules are compliant or noncompliant.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceSummary": {
                  "NonCompliantResourceCount": {
                      "CappedCount": 3,
                      "CapExceeded": false
                  },
                  "ComplianceSummaryTimestamp": 1452204131.493,
                  "CompliantResourceCount": {
                      "CappedCount": 2,
                      "CapExceeded": false
                  }
              }
          }

              are compliant, up to a maximum of 25 for rules and 100  for  re-
              sources.

              CappedCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of Amazon Web Services resources or Config rules

              CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

          NonCompliantResourceCount -> (structure)
              The number of Config rules or Amazon Web Services resources that

              resources.

              CappedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of Amazon Web Services resources or  Config  rules
