DESCRIBE-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-BDESCRIBE-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-BY-CONFIG-RULES()



NAME
       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of compliant and noncompliant rules with the number of
       resources for compliant and noncompliant rules. Does not display  rules
       that do not have compliance results.

       NOTE:
          The results can return an empty result page, but if you have a next-
          Token , the results are displayed on the next page.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-config-rules is a paginated operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults  of  the following query expressions: AggregateComplianceByConfi-
       gRules

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters the results by ConfigRuleComplianceFilters object.

          ConfigRuleName -> (string)
              The name of the Config rule.

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              The rule compliance status.

              For the ConfigRuleComplianceFilters data type,  Config  supports
              only  COMPLIANT  and NON_COMPLIANT . Config does not support the
              NOT_APPLICABLE and the INSUFFICIENT_DATA values.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

          AwsRegion -> (string)
              The source region where the data is aggregated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigRuleName=string,ComplianceType=string,AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigRuleName": "string",
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"NOT_APPLICABLE"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
            "AccountId": "string",
            "AwsRegion": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       AggregateComplianceByConfigRules -> (list)
          Returns a list of AggregateComplianceByConfigRule object.

          (structure)
              Indicates  whether  an Config rule is compliant based on account
              ID, region, compliance, and rule name.

              A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule evalu-
              ated  comply  with  it.  It  is noncompliant if any of these re-
              sources do not comply.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource  or  Config
                 rule  is  compliant  and  provides the number of contributors
                 that affect the compliance.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Con-
                     fig rule is compliant.

                     A  resource  is  compliant if it complies with all of the
                     Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant
                     if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

                     A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule
                     evaluates comply with it. A rule is noncompliant  if  any
                     of these resources do not comply.

                     Config returns the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value when no evalu-
                     ation results are available for the Amazon  Web  Services
                     resource or Config rule.

                     For  the  Compliance data type, Config supports only COM-
                     PLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT ,  and  INSUFFICIENT_DATA  values.
                     Config  does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE value for the
                     Compliance data type.

                 ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)
                     The number of Amazon Web  Services  resources  or  Config
                     rules that cause a result of NON_COMPLIANT , up to a max-
                     imum number.

                     CappedCount -> (integer)
                        The number of Amazon Web Services resources or  Config
                        rules  responsible  for  the current compliance of the
                        item.

                     CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The source region from where the data is aggregated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
