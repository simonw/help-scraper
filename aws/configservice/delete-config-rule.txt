DELETE-CONFIG-RULE()                                      DELETE-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       delete-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the specified Config rule and all of its evaluation results.

       Config  sets the state of a rule to DELETING until the deletion is com-
       plete. You cannot update a rule while it is in this state. If you  make
       a  PutConfigRule or DeleteConfigRule request for the rule, you will re-
       ceive a ResourceInUseException .

       You can check the state of a rule by using the DescribeConfigRules  re-
       quest.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-config-rule
          --config-rule-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule that you want to delete.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
