PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()                  PUT-CONFIGURATION-AGGREGATOR()



NAME
       put-configuration-aggregator -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  and  updates  the  configuration  aggregator with the selected
       source accounts and regions. The source account can be  individual  ac-
       count(s) or an organization.
          accountIds  that are passed will be replaced with existing accounts.
          If you want to add additional accounts into the aggregator, call De-
          scribeAggregator  to  get  the previous accounts and then append new
          ones.

       NOTE:
          Config should be enabled in source accounts and regions you want  to
          aggregate.

          If your source type is an organization, you must be signed in to the
          management account or a registered delegated administrator  and  all
          the  features must be enabled in your organization. If the caller is
          a management account, Config calls EnableAwsServiceAccess API to en-
          able  integration between Config and Organizations. If the caller is
          a registered delegated administrator, Config calls  ListDelegatedAd-
          ministrators  API  to verify whether the caller is a valid delegated
          administrator.

          To register a delegated administrator, see Register a Delegated  Ad-
          ministrator in the Config developer guide.

                 gions.

                 The source regions being aggregated.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountIds=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean,AwsRegions=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "AccountIds": ["string", ...],
              "AllAwsRegions": true|false,
              "AwsRegions": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --organization-aggregation-source (structure)
          An OrganizationAggregationSource object.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              ARN of the IAM role used to retrieve Amazon Web Services Organi-
              zation details associated with the aggregator account.

          AwsRegions -> (list)
              The source regions being aggregated.

              (string)

          AllAwsRegions -> (boolean)
              If true, aggregate existing Config regions and future regions.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RoleArn=string,AwsRegions=string,string,AllAwsRegions=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "AwsRegions": ["string", ...],
            "AllAwsRegions": true|false
          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of tag object.

          (structure)
              The  tags for the resource. The metadata that you apply to a re-
              source to help you categorize and organize them. Each  tag  con-
              sists  of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
              Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128  characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
