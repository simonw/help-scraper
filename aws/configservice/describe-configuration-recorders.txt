NAME
       describe-configuration-recorders -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details for the specified configuration recorders. If the
       configuration recorder is not specified, this action  returns  the  de-
       tails for all configuration recorders associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  you  can specify only one configuration recorder per re-
          gion in your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-recorders
          [--configuration-recorder-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-names (list)
          A list of configuration recorder names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about the configuration recorder

       The  following  command returns details about the default configuration
       recorder:

          aws configservice describe-configuration-recorders

       Output:

          {
              "ConfigurationRecorders": [
                  {
                      "recordingGroup": {
                          "allSupported": true,
                          "resourceTypes": [],
                          "includeGlobalResourceTypes": true
                      },
                      "roleARN": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/config-ConfigRole-A1B2C3D4E5F6",
                      "name": "default"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ConfigurationRecorders -> (list)
          A list that contains the descriptions of the specified configuration
          recorders.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the recording of configuration changes
              of an Amazon Web Services resource.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the recorder. By  default,  Config  automatically
                 assigns  the  name  "default" when creating the configuration
                 recorder. You cannot change the assigned name.

              roleARN -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role used  to  describe
                 the  Amazon  Web  Services  resources associated with the ac-
                 count.

              recordingGroup -> (structure)
                 Specifies the types of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources  for
                 which Config records configuration changes.

                 allSupported -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  Config  records configuration changes
                     for every supported type of regional resource.

                     If you set this option to true , when Config adds support
                     for  a new type of regional resource, it starts recording
                     resources of that type automatically.

                     If you set this option to true , you cannot  enumerate  a
                     list of resourceTypes .

                 includeGlobalResourceTypes -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether Config includes all supported types of
                     global resources (for example, IAM  resources)  with  the
                     resources that it records.

                     Before you can set this option to true , you must set the
                     allSupported option to true .

                     If you set this option to true , when Config adds support
                     for  a  new  type of global resource, it starts recording
                     resources of that type automatically.

                     The configuration details for any global resource are the
                     same  in  all regions. To prevent duplicate configuration
                     items, you should consider customizing Config in only one
                     region to record global resources.

                 resourceTypes -> (list)
                     A comma-separated list that specifies the types of Amazon
                     Web Services resources for which Config records  configu-
                     ration   changes   (for  example,  AWS::EC2::Instance  or
                     AWS::CloudTrail::Trail ).

                     To record all configuration changes,  you  must  set  the
                     allSupported option to true .

                     If  you  set this option to false , when Config adds sup-
                     port for a new type of resource, it will not  record  re-
                     sources of that type unless you manually add that type to
                     your recording group.

                     For a list of valid resourceTypes  values,  see  the  re-
                     sourceType  Value column in Supported Amazon Web Services
                     resource Types .

                     (string)
