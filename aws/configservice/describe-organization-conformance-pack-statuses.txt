DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMDESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFORMANCE-PACK-STATUSES()



NAME
       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides organization conformance pack deployment status for an organi-
       zation.

       NOTE:
          The status is not considered successful until  organization  confor-
          mance  pack is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with
          an exception of excluded accounts.

          When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive  a  pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify organization conformance pack names. They are  only  applicable,
          when you request all the organization conformance packs.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses  is  a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query  expressions:  OrganizationCon-
       formancePackStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-conformance-pack-statuses
          [--organization-conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-names (list)
          The  names of organization conformance packs for which you want sta-
          tus details. If you do not specify any names, Config returns details
          for all your organization conformance packs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConformancePackStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConformancePackStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Returns  the  status  for an organization conformance pack in an
              organization.

              OrganizationConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization conformance pack.

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status of  an  organization  conformance
                 pack.  When  master  account  calls PutOrganizationConforman-
                 cePack for the first time, conformance pack status is created
                 in  all the member accounts. When master account calls PutOr-
                 ganizationConformancePack for the  second  time,  conformance
                 pack  status is updated in all the member accounts. Addition-
                 ally, conformance pack status is updated  when  one  or  more
                 member  accounts  join  or leave an organization. Conformance
                 pack status is deleted when the master account deletes  Orga-
                 nizationConformancePack  in  all the member accounts and dis-
                 ables  service  access  for  config-multiaccountsetup.amazon-
                 aws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully created in all the member accounts.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS when an  organization  conformance  pack
                   creation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  when  an  organization conformance pack cre-
                   ation failed in one or more member accounts within that or-
                   ganization.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  when  an organization conformance pack dele-
                   tion failed in one or more member accounts within that  or-
                   ganization.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an  organization conformance pack
                   deletion is in progress.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully deleted from all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization conformance pack has
                   been successfully updated in all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when an  organization  conformance  pack
                   update is in progress.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED  when an organization conformance pack update
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An  error code that is returned when organization conformance
                 pack creation or deletion has failed in a member account.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An error message  indicating  that  organization  conformance
                 pack creation or deletion failed due to an error.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
