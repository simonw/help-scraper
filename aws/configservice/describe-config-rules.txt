DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULES()                                DESCRIBE-CONFIG-RULES()



NAME
       describe-config-rules -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details about your Config rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-config-rules  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ConfigRules

SYNOPSIS
            describe-config-rules
          [--config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          The names of the Config rules for which you want details. If you  do
          not specify any names, Config returns details for all your rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details for an AWS Config rule

       The following command returns details for an AWS Config rule named  In-
       stanceTypesAreT2micro:

          aws configservice describe-config-rules --config-rule-names InstanceTypesAreT2micro

       Output:

          }

OUTPUT
       ConfigRules -> (list)
          The details about your Config rules.

          (structure)
              An Config rule represents an Lambda function that you create for
              a custom rule or a predefined function  for  an  Config  managed
              rule.  The  function  evaluates  configuration  items  to assess
              whether your Amazon Web Services resources comply with your  de-
              sired  configurations. This function can run when Config detects
              a configuration change to an Amazon Web Services resource and at
              a  periodic  frequency  that  you  choose (for example, every 24
              hours).

              NOTE:
                 You can use the Amazon Web Services CLI and Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices SDKs if you want to create a rule that triggers evalua-
                 tions for your resources when Config delivers the  configura-
                 tion  snapshot.  For more information, see  ConfigSnapshotDe-
                 liveryProperties .

              For more information about developing and  using  Config  rules,
              see  Evaluating Amazon Web Services resource Configurations with
              Config in the Config Developer Guide .

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to the Config rule. The name is  re-
                 quired if you are adding a new rule.

              ConfigRuleArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Config rule.

              ConfigRuleId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Config rule.

              Description -> (string)
                 The description that you provide for the Config rule.

              Scope -> (structure)
                 Defines  which  resources  can  trigger an evaluation for the
                 rule. The scope can include one or  more  resource  types,  a
                 combination  of  one  resource type and one resource ID, or a
                 combination of a tag key and value. Specify a scope  to  con-
                 strain  the  resources that can trigger an evaluation for the
                 rule. If you do not specify a scope,  evaluations  are  trig-
                 gered when any resource in the recording group changes.

                 NOTE:
                     The scope can be empty.

                 ComplianceResourceTypes -> (list)
                     The  resource types of only those Amazon Web Services re-
                     sources that you want to trigger an  evaluation  for  the
                     rule. You can only specify one type if you also specify a
                     resource ID for ComplianceResourceId .

                     (string)

                 TagKey -> (string)
                     The tag key that is applied to only those Amazon Web Ser-
                     vices  resources  that  you want to trigger an evaluation
                     for the rule.

                 TagValue -> (string)
                     The tag value applied to only those Amazon  Web  Services
                     resources  that you want to trigger an evaluation for the
                     rule. If you specify a value for TagValue , you must also
                     specify a value for TagKey .

                 ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                     The  ID of the only Amazon Web Services resource that you
                     want to trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you  spec-
                     ify a resource ID, you must specify one resource type for
                     ComplianceResourceTypes .

              Source -> (structure)
                 Provides the rule owner (Amazon Web  Services  or  customer),
                 the  rule  identifier,  and  the notifications that cause the
                 function to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.

                 Owner -> (string)
                     Indicates whether Amazon Web  Services  or  the  customer
                     owns and manages the Config rule.

                     Config Managed Rules are predefined rules owned by Amazon
                     Web Services. For more information,  see  Config  Managed
                     Rules in the Config developer guide.

                     Config Custom Rules are rules that you can develop either
                     with Guard (CUSTOM_POLICY ) or Lambda  (CUSTOM_LAMBDA  ).
                     For more information, see Config Custom Rules in the Con-
                     fig developer guide.

                 SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                     For Config Managed rules, a predefined identifier from  a
                     list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
                     To reference a managed rule, see List of  Config  Managed
                     Rules .

                     For  Config  Custom  Lambda  rules, the identifier is the
                     Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rule's Lambda function,
                     such    as    arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:func-
                     tion:custom_rule_name .

                     For Config Custom Policy rules, this field  will  be  ig-
                     nored.

                 SourceDetails -> (list)
                     Provides the source and the message types that cause Con-
                     fig  to  evaluate  your  Amazon  Web  Services  resources
                     against a rule. It also provides the frequency with which
                     you want Config to run evaluations for the  rule  if  the
                     trigger type is periodic.

                     If  the  owner is set to CUSTOM_POLICY , the only accept-
                     able values for the Config rule trigger message type  are
                     ConfigurationItemChangeNotification and OversizedConfigu-
                     rationItemChangeNotification .

                     (structure)
                        Provides the source and the message types that trigger
                        Config  to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources
                        against a rule. It also provides  the  frequency  with
                        which  you want Config to run evaluations for the rule
                        if the trigger type is periodic. You can  specify  the
                        parameter  values  for  SourceDetail  only  for custom
                        rules.

                        EventSource -> (string)
                            The source of the event, such  as  an  Amazon  Web
                            Services service, that triggers Config to evaluate
                            your Amazon Web Services resources.

                        MessageType -> (string)
                            The type of notification that triggers  Config  to
                            run  an evaluation for a rule. You can specify the
                            following notification types:

                            o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Triggers
                              an  evaluation when Config delivers a configura-
                              tion item as a result of a resource change.

                            o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification   -
                              Triggers  an  evaluation when Config delivers an
                              oversized configuration item. Config may  gener-
                              ate  this  notification  type  when  a  resource
                              changes and the notification exceeds the maximum
                              size allowed by Amazon SNS.

                            o ScheduledNotification   -  Triggers  a  periodic
                              evaluation at the frequency specified for  Maxi-
                              mumExecutionFrequency .

                            o ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted  -  Trig-
                              gers a periodic evaluation when Config  delivers
                              a configuration snapshot.

                            If  you  want  your custom rule to be triggered by
                            configuration changes,  specify  two  SourceDetail
                            objects,  one for ConfigurationItemChangeNotifica-
                            tion  and  one   for   OversizedConfigurationItem-
                            ChangeNotification .

                        MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                            The  frequency  at  which  you  want Config to run
                            evaluations for a  custom  rule  with  a  periodic
                            trigger.  If you specify a value for MaximumExecu-
                            tionFrequency ,  then  MessageType  must  use  the
                            ScheduledNotification value.

                            NOTE:
                               By  default,  rules with a periodic trigger are
                               evaluated every 24 hours. To  change  the  fre-
                               quency,  specify  a  valid  value for the Maxi-
                               mumExecutionFrequency parameter.

                               Based on the valid  value  you  choose,  Config
                               runs evaluations once for each valid value. For
                               example, if you  choose  Three_Hours  ,  Config
                               runs  evaluations  once  every  three hours. In
                               this case, Three_Hours is the frequency of this
                               rule.

                 CustomPolicyDetails -> (structure)
                     Provides  the  runtime  system,  policy  definition,  and
                     whether debug logging is enabled. Required when owner  is
                     set to CUSTOM_POLICY .

                     PolicyRuntime -> (string)
                        The runtime system for your Config Custom Policy rule.
                        Guard is a policy-as-code language that allows you  to
                        write policies that are enforced by Config Custom Pol-
                        icy rules. For more information about Guard,  see  the
                        Guard GitHub Repository .

                     PolicyText -> (string)
                        The  policy  definition  containing the logic for your
                        Config Custom Policy rule.

                     EnableDebugLogDelivery -> (boolean)
                        The boolean expression for enabling debug logging  for
                        your  Config  Custom Policy rule. The default value is
                        false .

              InputParameters -> (string)
                 A string, in JSON format, that is passed to the  Config  rule
                 Lambda function.

              MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                 The  maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations for
                 a rule. You can specify a value for MaximumExecutionFrequency
                 when:

                 o This  is  for an Config managed rule that is triggered at a
                   periodic frequency.

                 o Your custom rule is triggered when Config delivers the con-
                   figuration snapshot. For more information, see  ConfigSnap-
                   shotDeliveryProperties .

                 NOTE:
                     By default, rules with a periodic trigger  are  evaluated
                     every  24 hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid
                     value for the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

              ConfigRuleState -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the Config rule is active or  is  currently
                 being  deleted by Config. It can also indicate the evaluation
                 status for the Config rule.

                 Config sets the state of the rule to  EVALUATING  temporarily
                 after you use the StartConfigRulesEvaluation request to eval-
                 uate your resources against the Config rule.

                 Config sets the state of the rule to DELETING_RESULTS  tempo-
                 rarily  after  you use the DeleteEvaluationResults request to
                 delete the current evaluation results for the Config rule.

                 Config temporarily sets the state of a rule to DELETING after
