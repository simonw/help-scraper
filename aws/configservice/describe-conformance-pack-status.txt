DESCRIBE-CONFORMANCE-PACK-STATUS()          DESCRIBE-CONFORMANCE-PACK-STATUS()



NAME
       describe-conformance-pack-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides one or more conformance packs deployment status.

       NOTE:
          If there are no conformance packs then you will see an empty result.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-conformance-pack-status is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ConformancePackStatusDetails

SYNOPSIS
            describe-conformance-pack-status
          [--conformance-pack-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-names (list)
          Comma-separated list of conformance pack names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConformancePackStatusDetails -> (list)
          A list of ConformancePackStatusDetail objects.

          (structure)
              Status details of a conformance pack.

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 Name of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackId -> (string)
                 ID of the conformance pack.

              ConformancePackArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of comformance pack.

              ConformancePackState -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status of conformance pack.

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  a conformance pack creation is in
                   progress for an account.

                 o CREATE_COMPLETE when a conformance pack has  been  success-
                   fully created in your account.

                 o CREATE_FAILED  when  a  conformance pack creation failed in
                   your account.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when a conformance pack deletion  is  in
                   progress.

                 o DELETE_FAILED  when  a  conformance pack deletion failed in
                   your account.

              StackArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of CloudFormation stack.

              ConformancePackStatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason of conformance pack creation failure.

              LastUpdateRequestedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last time when conformation pack creation and update was  re-
                 quested.

              LastUpdateCompletedTime -> (timestamp)
                 Last time when conformation pack creation and update was suc-
                 cessful.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
