NAME
       describe-compliance-by-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Indicates  whether the specified Amazon Web Services resources are com-
       pliant. If a resource is noncompliant, this action returns  the  number
       of Config rules that the resource does not comply with.

       A  resource  is compliant if it complies with all the Config rules that
       evaluate it. It is noncompliant if it does not comply with one or  more
       of these rules.

       If  Config  has  no current evaluation results for the resource, it re-
       turns INSUFFICIENT_DATA . This result might indicate one of the follow-
       ing conditions about the rules that evaluate the resource:

       o Config has never invoked an evaluation for the rule. To check whether
         it has, use the DescribeConfigRuleEvaluationStatus action to get  the
         LastSuccessfulInvocationTime and LastFailedInvocationTime .

       o The  rule's  Lambda function is failing to send evaluation results to
         Config. Verify that the role that you assigned to your  configuration
         recorder  includes  the config:PutEvaluations permission. If the rule
         is a custom rule, verify that the Lambda execution role includes  the
         config:PutEvaluations permission.

       o The rule's Lambda function has returned NOT_APPLICABLE for all evalu-
         ation results. This can occur if the resources were  deleted  or  re-
         moved from the rule's scope.

       describe-compliance-by-resource  is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: ComplianceByResources

OPTIONS
       --resource-type (string)
          The types of Amazon Web Services resources for which you  want  com-
          pliance information (for example, AWS::EC2::Instance ). For this ac-
          tion, you can specify that the resource type is an Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices account by specifying AWS::::Account .

       --resource-id (string)
          The  ID  of the Amazon Web Services resource for which you want com-
          pliance information. You can specify only one resource  ID.  If  you
          specify a resource ID, you must also specify a type for ResourceType
          .

       --compliance-types (list)
          Filters the results by compliance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            COMPLIANT
            NON_COMPLIANT
            NOT_APPLICABLE
            INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To get compliance information for your AWS resources

       The  following  command returns compliance information for each EC2 in-
       stance that is recorded by AWS Config and that  violates  one  or  more
       rules:

          aws configservice describe-compliance-by-resource --resource-type AWS::EC2::Instance --compliance-types NON_COMPLIANT

       In  the  output, the value for each CappedCount attribute indicates how
       many rules the resource violates. For example, the following output in-
       dicates that instance i-1a2b3c4d violates 2 rules.

       Output:

          {
              "ComplianceByResources": [
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                      "ResourceId": "i-1a2b3c4d",
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 2,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance",
                      "ResourceId": "i-2a2b3c4d ",
                      "Compliance": {
                          "ComplianceContributorCount": {
                              "CappedCount": 3,
                              "CapExceeded": false
                          },
                          "ComplianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT"
                      }
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ComplianceByResources -> (list)
          Indicates  whether  the  specified Amazon Web Services resource com-
          plies with all of the Config rules that evaluate it.

          (structure)
              Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource that is evalu-
              ated  according  to one or more Config rules is compliant. A re-
              source is compliant if it complies with all of  the  rules  that
              evaluate  it.  A  resource is noncompliant if it does not comply
              with one or more of these rules.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was  evalu-
                 ated.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services resource that was evalu-
                 ated.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 Indicates whether the Amazon Web Services  resource  complies
                 with all of the Config rules that evaluated it.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     Indicates whether an Amazon Web Services resource or Con-
                     fig rule is compliant.

                     A resource is compliant if it complies with  all  of  the
                     Config rules that evaluate it. A resource is noncompliant
                     if it does not comply with one or more of these rules.

                     A rule is compliant if all of the resources that the rule
                     evaluates  comply  with it. A rule is noncompliant if any
                     of these resources do not comply.

                     Config returns the INSUFFICIENT_DATA value when no evalu-
                     ation  results  are available for the Amazon Web Services
                     resource or Config rule.

                     For the Compliance data type, Config supports  only  COM-
                     PLIANT  ,  NON_COMPLIANT  , and INSUFFICIENT_DATA values.
                     Config does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE value for  the
                     Compliance data type.

                 ComplianceContributorCount -> (structure)
                     The  number  of  Amazon  Web Services resources or Config
                     rules that cause a result of NON_COMPLIANT , up to a max-
                     imum number.

                     CappedCount -> (integer)
                        The  number of Amazon Web Services resources or Config
                        rules responsible for the current  compliance  of  the
                        item.

                     CapExceeded -> (boolean)
                        Indicates whether the maximum count is reached.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
