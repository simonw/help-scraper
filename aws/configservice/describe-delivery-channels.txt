NAME
       describe-delivery-channels -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  details  about  the  specified delivery channel. If a delivery
       channel is not specified, this action returns the details of all deliv-
       ery channels associated with the account.

       NOTE:
          Currently,  you  can specify only one delivery channel per region in
          your account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-delivery-channels
          [--delivery-channel-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --delivery-channel-names (list)
          A list of delivery channel names.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details about the delivery channel

       The following command returns details about the delivery channel:

          aws configservice describe-delivery-channels

       Output:

          {
              "DeliveryChannels": [
                  {
                      "snsTopicARN": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:config-topic",
                      "name": "default",
                      "s3BucketName": "config-bucket-123456789012"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       DeliveryChannels -> (list)
          A  list  that  contains  the  descriptions of the specified delivery
          channel.

          (structure)
              The channel through which Config delivers notifications and  up-
              dated configuration states.

              name -> (string)
                 The  name of the delivery channel. By default, Config assigns
                 the name "default" when creating  the  delivery  channel.  To
                 change  the delivery channel name, you must use the DeleteDe-
                 liveryChannel action to delete your current delivery channel,
                 and  then you must use the PutDeliveryChannel command to cre-
                 ate a delivery channel that has the desired name.

              s3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon S3 bucket  to  which  Config  delivers
                 configuration snapshots and configuration history files.

                 If  you  specify  a bucket that belongs to another Amazon Web
                 Services account, that bucket must have policies  that  grant
                 access  permissions  to  Config.  For  more  information, see
                 Permissions for the Amazon S3 Bucket in the Config  Developer
                 Guide.

              s3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The prefix for the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

              s3KmsKeyArn -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service
                 (KMS ) KMS key (KMS key) used to encrypt objects delivered by
                 Config.  Must belong to the same Region as the destination S3
                 bucket.

              snsTopicARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Amazon  SNS  topic  to
                 which Config sends notifications about configuration changes.

                 If  you  choose  a topic from another account, the topic must
                 have policies that grant access permissions  to  Config.  For
                 more information, see Permissions for the Amazon SNS Topic in
                 the Config Developer Guide.

              configSnapshotDeliveryProperties -> (structure)
                 The options for how often Config delivers configuration snap-
                 shots to the Amazon S3 bucket.

                 deliveryFrequency -> (string)
                     The  frequency  with  which Config delivers configuration
                     snapshots.
