GET-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-DETAGET-AGGREGATE-COMPLIANCE-DETAILS-BY-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the evaluation results for the specified Config rule for a spe-
       cific resource in a rule. The results indicate which  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices resources were evaluated by the rule, when each resource was last
       evaluated, and whether each resource complies with the rule.

       NOTE:
          The results can return an empty result page. But if you have a next-
          Token , the results are displayed on the next page.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule  is  a paginated opera-
       tion. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire
       data  set  of  results.  You  can  disable  pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment  on  a  paginated response, the --query argument must extract data
       from the results of the following query  expressions:  AggregateEvalua-
       tionResults

SYNOPSIS
            get-aggregate-compliance-details-by-config-rule
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          --config-rule-name <value>
          --account-id <value>
          --aws-region <value>
          [--compliance-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --config-rule-name (string)
          The  name  of the Config rule for which you want compliance informa-
          tion.

       --account-id (string)
          The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

       --aws-region (string)
          The source region from where the data is aggregated.

       --compliance-type (string)
          The resource compliance status.

          NOTE:
              For  the  GetAggregateComplianceDetailsByConfigRuleRequest  data
              type,  Config  supports  only  the COMPLIANT and NON_COMPLIANT .
              Config does not support the NOT_APPLICABLE and INSUFFICIENT_DATA
              values.

          Possible values:

          o COMPLIANT

          o NON_COMPLIANT

          o NOT_APPLICABLE

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AggregateEvaluationResults -> (list)
          Returns an AggregateEvaluationResults object.

          (structure)
              The details of an Config evaluation for an account ID and region
              in an aggregator. Provides the Amazon Web Services resource that
              was  evaluated,  the  compliance  of  the resource, related time
              stamps, and supplementary information.

              EvaluationResultIdentifier -> (structure)
                 Uniquely identifies the evaluation result.

                     Identifies an Config rule used to evaluate an Amazon  Web
                     Services  resource,  and  provides the type and ID of the
                     evaluated resource.

                     ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                        The name of the Config rule that was used in the eval-
                        uation.

                     ResourceType -> (string)
                        The  type  of  Amazon  Web  Services resource that was
                        evaluated.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The ID of the evaluated Amazon Web Services resource.

                     The time of the event that triggered  the  evaluation  of
                     your Amazon Web Services resources. The time can indicate
                     when Config delivered a configuration item change notifi-
                     cation, or it can indicate when Config delivered the con-
                     figuration snapshot, depending on which  event  triggered
                     the evaluation.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 The resource compliance status.

                 ports only the COMPLIANT and NON_COMPLIANT . Config does  not
                 support the NOT_APPLICABLE and INSUFFICIENT_DATA value.

                 The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The source region from where the data is aggregated.
