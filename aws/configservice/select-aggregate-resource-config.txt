SELECT-AGGREGATE-RESOURCE-CONFIG()          SELECT-AGGREGATE-RESOURCE-CONFIG()



NAME
       select-aggregate-resource-config -

DESCRIPTION
       Accepts  a structured query language (SQL) SELECT command and an aggre-
       gator to query configuration state of  Amazon  Web  Services  resources
       across  multiple  accounts  and  regions,  performs  the  corresponding
       search, and returns resource configurations matching the properties.

       For more information about query components, see the ` Query Components
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/query-components.html`__
       section in the Config Developer Guide.

       NOTE:
          If you run an aggregation query (i.e., using GROUP BY or  using  ag-
          gregate  functions such as COUNT ; e.g., SELECT resourceId, COUNT(*)
          WHERE resourceType = 'AWS::IAM::Role' GROUP BY resourceId )  and  do
          not  specify  the  MaxResults or the Limit query parameters, the de-
          fault page size is set to 500.

          If you run a non-aggregation query (i.e., not using GROUP BY or  ag-
          gregate    function;   e.g.,   SELECT   *   WHERE   resourceType   =
          'AWS::IAM::Role' ) and do not specify the MaxResults  or  the  Limit
          query parameters, the default page size is set to 25.

       select-aggregate-resource-config is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Results

SYNOPSIS
            select-aggregate-resource-config
          --expression <value>
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --expression (string)
          The SQL query SELECT command.

       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of query results returned on  each  page.  Config
          also allows the Limit request parameter.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Results -> (list)
          Returns the results for the SQL query.

          (string)

       QueryInfo -> (structure)
          Details about the query.

          SelectFields -> (list)
              Returns a FieldInfo object.

              (structure)
                 Details about the fields such as name of the field.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name of the field.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
