NAME
       describe-remediation-configurations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the details of one or more remediation configurations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-remediation-configurations
          --config-rule-names <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-names (list)
          A  list of Config rule names of remediation configurations for which
          you want details.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       RemediationConfigurations -> (list)
          Returns a remediation configuration object.

          (structure)
              An object that represents the details about the remediation con-
              figuration that includes the remediation action, parameters, and
              data to execute the action.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name of the Config rule.

              TargetType -> (string)
                 The  type of the target. Target executes remediation. For ex-
                 ample, SSM document.

              TargetId -> (string)
                 Target ID is the name of the public document.

              TargetVersion -> (string)
                 Version of the target. For example, version of the SSM  docu-
                 ment.

                 NOTE:
                     If you make backward incompatible changes to the SSM doc-
                     ument,  you  must  call  PutRemediationConfiguration  API
                     again to ensure the remediations can run.

              Parameters -> (map)
                 An object of the RemediationParameterValue.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (structure)
                     The  value  is  either  a  dynamic  (resource) value or a
                     static value. You must select either a dynamic value or a
                     static value.

                     ResourceValue -> (structure)
                        The value is dynamic and changes at run-time.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value is a resource ID.

                     StaticValue -> (structure)
                        The value is static and does not change at run-time.

                        Values -> (list)
                            A  list of values. For example, the ARN of the as-
                            sumed role.

                            (string)

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              Automatic -> (boolean)
                 The remediation is triggered automatically.

              ExecutionControls -> (structure)
                 An ExecutionControls object.

                 SsmControls -> (structure)
                     A SsmControls object.

                     ConcurrentExecutionRatePercentage -> (integer)
                        The maximum percentage of remediation actions  allowed
                        to  run in parallel on the non-compliant resources for
                        that specific rule. You can specify a percentage, such
                        as 10%. The default value is 10.

                     ErrorPercentage -> (integer)
                        The  percentage  of errors that are allowed before SSM
                        stops running automations on  non-compliant  resources
                        for  that  specific rule. You can specify a percentage
                        of errors, for example 10%. If you do not  specifiy  a
                        percentage,  the  default  is 50%. For example, if you
                        set the ErrorPercentage to 40%  for  10  non-compliant
                        resources, then SSM stops running the automations when
                        the fifth error is received.

              MaximumAutomaticAttempts -> (integer)
                 The maximum number of failed attempts  for  auto-remediation.
                 If you do not select a number, the default is 5.

                 For  example,  if  you  specify MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5
                 with RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds, Config will put a Re-
                 mediationException  on  your  behalf for the failing resource
                 after the 5th failed attempt within 50 seconds.

              RetryAttemptSeconds -> (long)
                 Maximum time in seconds that Config runs auto-remediation. If
                 you do not select a number, the default is 60 seconds.

                 For example, if you specify RetryAttemptSeconds as 50 seconds
                 and MaximumAutomaticAttempts as 5, Config will run auto-reme-
                 diations  5 times within 50 seconds before throwing an excep-
                 tion.

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of remediation configuration.

              CreatedByService -> (string)
                 Name of the service that owns the service-linked rule, if ap-
                 plicable.
