PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()                  PUT-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       put-organization-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates organization config rule for your entire organization
       evaluating whether your Amazon Web Services resources comply with  your
       desired configurations.

       Only  a  master account and a delegated administrator can create or up-
       date an organization config rule. When calling this API  with  a  dele-
       gated  administrator, you must ensure Organizations ListDelegatedAdmin-
       istrator permissions are added.

       This API enables organization service access through the  EnableAWSSer-
       viceAccess  action and creates a service linked role AWSServiceRoleFor-
       ConfigMultiAccountSetup in the master or  delegated  administrator  ac-
       count  of  your  organization.  The service linked role is created only
       when the role does not exist in the caller account. Config verifies the
       existence of role with GetRole action.

       To  use this API with delegated administrator, register a delegated ad-
       ministrator by calling Amazon Web Services Organization  register-dele-
       gated-administrator for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

       You  can  use this action to create both custom Config rules and Config
       managed rules. If you are adding a new custom  Config  rule,  you  must
       first  create  Lambda function in the master account or a delegated ad-
       ministrator that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources. You  also
       need  to  create an IAM role in the managed-account that can be assumed
       by the Lambda function. When you use the PutOrganizationConfigRule  ac-
       tion  to  add  the rule to Config, you must specify the Amazon Resource
       Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the function. If you  are  adding  an
       Config  managed rule, specify the rule's identifier for the RuleIdenti-
       fier key.

       The maximum number of organization config rules that Config supports is
       150 and 3 delegated administrator per organization.

       NOTE:
          Prerequisite:  Ensure  you  call EnableAllFeatures API to enable all
          features in an organization.

          Specify either OrganizationCustomRuleMetadata or OrganizationManage-
          dRuleMetadata .

SYNOPSIS
            put-organization-config-rule
          --organization-config-rule-name <value>
          [--organization-managed-rule-metadata <value>]
          [--organization-custom-rule-metadata <value>]
          [--excluded-accounts <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-name (string)
          The name that you assign to an organization config rule.

       --organization-managed-rule-metadata (structure)
          An OrganizationManagedRuleMetadata object.

          Description -> (string)
              The description that you provide for organization config rule.

          RuleIdentifier -> (string)
              For  organization  config managed rules, a predefined identifier
              from a list. For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule.
              To reference a managed rule, see Using Config managed rules .

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A  string, in JSON format, that is passed to organization config
              rule Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The maximum frequency with which Config runs evaluations  for  a
              rule.  You are using an Config managed rule that is triggered at
              a periodic frequency.

              NOTE:
                 By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every
                 24  hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for
                 the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

          ResourceTypesScope -> (list)
              The type of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

              (string)

          ResourceIdScope -> (string)
              The ID of the Amazon Web Services resource that was evaluated.

          TagKeyScope -> (string)
              One part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a gen-
              eral  label that acts like a category for more specific tag val-
              ues.

          TagValueScope -> (string)
              The optional part of a key-value pair that  make  up  a  tag.  A
              value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

              The lambda function ARN.

          OrganizationConfigRuleTriggerTypes -> (list)
              The  type of notification that triggers Config to run an evalua-
              tion for a rule. You  can  specify  the  following  notification
              types:

              o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Triggers an evaluation
                when Config delivers a configuration item as a result of a re-
                source change.

              o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification   -  Triggers  an
                evaluation when Config  delivers  an  oversized  configuration
                item.  Config  may  generate this notification type when a re-
                source changes and the notification exceeds the  maximum  size
                allowed by Amazon SNS.

              o ScheduledNotification  - Triggers a periodic evaluation at the
                frequency specified for MaximumExecutionFrequency .

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The  maximum  frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a
              rule. Your custom rule is triggered  when  Config  delivers  the

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an organization config rule.
