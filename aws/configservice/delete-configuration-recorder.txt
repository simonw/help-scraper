DELETE-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER()                DELETE-CONFIGURATION-RECORDER()



NAME
       delete-configuration-recorder -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes the configuration recorder.

       After the configuration recorder is deleted, Config will not record re-
       source configuration changes  until  you  create  a  new  configuration
       recorder.

       This action does not delete the configuration information that was pre-
       viously recorded. You will be able to access  the  previously  recorded
       information  by using the GetResourceConfigHistory action, but you will
       not be able to access this information in the Config console until  you
       create a new configuration recorder.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-configuration-recorder
          --configuration-recorder-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-recorder-name (string)
          The  name  of  the configuration recorder to be deleted. You can re-
          trieve the name of your configuration  recorder  by  using  the  De-
          scribeConfigurationRecorders action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
