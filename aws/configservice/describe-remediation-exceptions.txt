NAME
       describe-remediation-exceptions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  details of one or more remediation exceptions. A detailed
       view of a remediation exception for a set of resources that includes an
       explanation  of  an  exception  and the time when the exception will be
       deleted. When you specify the limit and the next token, you  receive  a
       paginated response.

       NOTE:
          Config  generates a remediation exception when a problem occurs exe-
          cuting a remediation action to a specific resource. Remediation  ex-
          ceptions blocks auto-remediation until the exception is cleared.

          When  you  specify the limit and the next token, you receive a pagi-
          nated response.

          Limit and next token are not applicable if you request resources  in
          batch. It is only applicable, when you request all resources.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-remediation-exceptions
          --config-rule-name <value>
          [--resource-keys <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule-name (string)
          The name of the Config rule.

       --resource-keys (list)
          An  exception  list  of resource exception keys to be processed with
          the current request. Config adds exception for  each  resource  key.
          For example, Config adds 3 exceptions for 3 resource keys.

          (structure)
              The  details  that  identify a resource within Config, including
              the resource type and resource ID.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of a resource.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the resource (for example., sg-xxxxxx).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceId=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of  RemediationExceptionResourceKey  returned  on
          each  page. The default is 25. If you specify 0, Config uses the de-
          fault.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       RemediationExceptions -> (list)
          Returns a list of remediation exception objects.

          (structure)

              ception. The details include the rule name, an explanation of an
              exception, the time when the exception will be deleted, the  re-
              source ID, and resource type.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
