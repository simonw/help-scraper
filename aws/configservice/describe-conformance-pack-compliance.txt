SYNOPSIS
            describe-conformance-pack-compliance
          --conformance-pack-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --conformance-pack-name (string)
          Name of the conformance pack.

       --filters (structure)
          A ConformancePackComplianceFilters object.

          ConfigRuleNames -> (list)
              Filters the results by Config rule names.

              (string)

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              Filters the results by compliance.

              The  allowed  values  are COMPLIANT and NON_COMPLIANT . INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA is not supported.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConfigRuleNames=string,string,ComplianceType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConfigRuleNames": ["string", ...],
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA"
          }

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of Config rules within a conformance pack are re-
          turned on each page.

       --next-token (string)
          The  nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConformancePackName -> (string)
          Name of the conformance pack.

       ConformancePackRuleComplianceList -> (list)
          Returns a list of ConformancePackRuleCompliance objects.

          (structure)
              Compliance information of one or more Config rules within a con-
              formance  pack.  You can filter using Config rule names and com-
              pliance types.

              ConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 Name of the config rule.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 Compliance of the Config rule.

                 The allowed values are COMPLIANT , NON_COMPLIANT , and INSUF-
                 FICIENT_DATA .

              Controls -> (list)
                 Controls  for the conformance pack. A control is a process to
                 prevent or detect problems while meeting objectives.  A  con-
                 trol  can  align  with a specific compliance regime or map to
                 internal controls defined by an organization.

                 (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned in a previous request that you use  to
          request the next page of results in a paginated response.
