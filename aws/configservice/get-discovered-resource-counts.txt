GET-DISCOVERED-RESOURCE-COUNTS()              GET-DISCOVERED-RESOURCE-COUNTS()



NAME
       get-discovered-resource-counts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  resource types, the number of each resource type, and the
       total number of resources that Config is recording in this  region  for
       your Amazon Web Services account.
          Example

       o Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Region
         for your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3 buckets.

       o You make a call to the GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action and specify
         that you want all resource types.

       o Config returns the following:

         o The resource types (EC2 instances, IAM users, and S3 buckets).

         o The number of each resource type (25, 20, and 15).

         o The total number of all resources (60).

       The  response is paginated. By default, Config lists 100  ResourceCount
       objects on each page. You can customize this number with the limit  pa-
       rameter. The response includes a nextToken string. To get the next page
       of results, run the request again and specify the string for the  next-
       Token parameter.

       NOTE:
          If  you  make a call to the  GetDiscoveredResourceCounts action, you
          might not immediately receive resource counts in the following situ-
          ations:

          o You are a new Config customer.

          o You just enabled resource recording.

          It  might take a few minutes for Config to record and count your re-
          sources. Wait a  few  minutes  and  then  retry  the   GetDiscovere-
          dResourceCounts action.

OPTIONS
       --resource-types (list)
          The  comma-separated list that specifies the resource types that you
          want  Config  to  return  (for   example,   "AWS::EC2::Instance"   ,
          "AWS::IAM::User" ).

          If  a  value  for resourceTypes is not specified, Config returns all
          resource types that Config is recording in the region for  your  ac-
          count.

          NOTE:
              If  the  configuration recorder is turned off, Config returns an
              empty list  of   ResourceCount  objects.  If  the  configuration
              recorder is not recording a specific resource type (for example,
              S3 buckets), that resource type is not returned in the  list  of
              ResourceCount objects.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The  maximum number of  ResourceCount objects returned on each page.
          The default is 100. You cannot specify a number greater than 100. If
          you specify 0, Config uses the default.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       totalDiscoveredResources -> (long)
          The total number of resources that Config is recording in the region
          for your account. If you specify resource types in the request, Con-
          fig  returns  only  the total number of resources for those resource
          types.
              Example

          o Config is recording three resource types in the US East (Ohio) Re-
            gion  for  your account: 25 EC2 instances, 20 IAM users, and 15 S3
            buckets, for a total of 60 resources.

          o You make a call  to  the  GetDiscoveredResourceCounts  action  and
            specify the resource type, "AWS::EC2::Instances" , in the request.

          o Config returns 25 for totalDiscoveredResources .

       resourceCounts -> (list)
          The list of ResourceCount objects. Each object is listed in descend-
          ing order by the number of resources.

          (structure)
              An object that contains the resource type and the number of  re-
              sources.

              resourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type (for example, "AWS::EC2::Instance" ).

              count -> (long)
                 The number of resources.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The string that you use in a subsequent request to get the next page
          of results in a paginated response.
