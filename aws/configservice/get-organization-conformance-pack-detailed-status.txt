NAME
       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  detailed status for each member account within an organization
       for a given organization conformance pack.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status is a paginated opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: OrganizationCon-
       formancePackDetailedStatuses

SYNOPSIS
            get-organization-conformance-pack-detailed-status
          --organization-conformance-pack-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-conformance-pack-name (string)
          The name of organization conformance pack for which you want  status
          details for member accounts.

       --filters (structure)
          An OrganizationResourceDetailedStatusFilters object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit account ID of the member account within an organi-
              zation.

          Status -> (string)
              Indicates deployment status for conformance pack in a member ac-
              count.  When master account calls PutOrganizationConformancePack
              action for the first time, conformance pack status is created in
              the  member  account. When master account calls PutOrganization-
              ConformancePack action for the  second  time,  conformance  pack
              status is updated in the member account. Conformance pack status
              is deleted when the master account  deletes  OrganizationConfor-
              mancePack   and  disables  service  access  for  config-multiac-
              countsetup.amazonaws.com .

              Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

              o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  created  in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being created in
                the member account.

              o CREATE_FAILED when conformance pack creation has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

              o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is being  deleted  in
                the member account.

              o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL  when  conformance  pack has been deleted in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has  been  updated  in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  conformance pack is being updated in
                the member account.

              o UPDATE_FAILED when conformance pack deletion has failed in the
                member account.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "Status": "CREATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"CREATE_FAILED"|"DELETE_SUCCESSFUL"|"DELETE_FAILED"|"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL"|"UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS"|"UPDATE_FAILED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              each  member  account. This includes the name of the conformance
              pack, the status, error code and error message when the  confor-
              mance pack creation or deletion failed.

              AccountId -> (string)

                 Indicates  deployment status for conformance pack in a member
                 account. When master account calls  PutOrganizationConforman-
                 cePack  action for the first time, conformance pack status is
                 created in the member  account.  When  master  account  calls

                 conformance pack status is updated  in  the  member  account.
                 Conformance  pack  status  is deleted when the master account
                 deletes OrganizationConformancePack and disables service  ac-
                 cess for config-multiaccountsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the conformance pack to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been created in
                   the member account.

                   in the member account.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been deleted in
                   the member account.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when conformance pack has been updated in
                   the member account.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS when conformance pack is  being  updated
                   in the member account.

                 An  error  message  indicating  that conformance pack account
                 creation or deletion has failed due to an error in the member
                 account.
