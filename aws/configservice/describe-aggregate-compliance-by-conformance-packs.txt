NAME
       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-conformance-packs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the conformance packs and their associated compliance
       status with the count of compliant and noncompliant Config rules within
       each conformance pack. Also returns the total rule count which includes
       compliant rules, noncompliant rules, and rules that cannot be evaluated
       due to insufficient data.

       NOTE:
          The results can return an empty result page, but if you have a next-
          Token , the results are displayed on the next page.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-aggregate-compliance-by-conformance-packs is a paginated oper-
       ation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: AggregateCompli-
       anceByConformancePacks

SYNOPSIS
            describe-aggregate-compliance-by-conformance-packs
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters the result by AggregateConformancePackComplianceFilters  ob-
          ject.

          ConformancePackName -> (string)
              The name of the conformance pack.

          ComplianceType -> (string)
              The compliance status of the conformance pack.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The  12-digit  Amazon  Web Services account ID of the source ac-
              count.

          AwsRegion -> (string)
              The source Amazon Web Services Region from where the data is ag-
              gregated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ConformancePackName=string,ComplianceType=string,AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ConformancePackName": "string",
            "ComplianceType": "COMPLIANT"|"NON_COMPLIANT"|"INSUFFICIENT_DATA",
            "AccountId": "string",
            "AwsRegion": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AggregateComplianceByConformancePacks -> (list)
          Returns the AggregateComplianceByConformancePack object.

          (structure)
              Provides aggregate compliance of the conformance pack. Indicates
              whether a conformance pack is compliant based on the name of the
              conformance pack, account ID, and region.

              A conformance pack is compliant if all of the rules in a confor-
              mance  packs  are  compliant.  It  is noncompliant if any of the
              rules are not compliant. The compliance status of a  conformance
              pack is INSUFFICIENT_DATA only if all rules within a conformance
              pack cannot be evaluated due to insufficient data.  If  some  of
              the rules in a conformance pack are compliant but the compliance
              status of other rules in that same conformance pack is  INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA, the conformance pack shows compliant.

              ConformancePackName -> (string)
                 The name of the conformance pack.

              Compliance -> (structure)
                 The compliance status of the conformance pack.

                 ComplianceType -> (string)
                     The compliance status of the conformance pack.

                 CompliantRuleCount -> (integer)
                     The number of compliant Config Rules.

                 NonCompliantRuleCount -> (integer)
                     The number of noncompliant Config Rules.

                 TotalRuleCount -> (integer)
                     Total  number of compliant rules, noncompliant rules, and
                     the rules that do not have any  applicable  resources  to
                     evaluate upon resulting in insufficient data.

              AccountId -> (string)
                 The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID of the source ac-
                 count.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The source Amazon Web Services Region from where the data  is
                 aggregated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
