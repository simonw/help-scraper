PUT-CONFIG-RULE()                                            PUT-CONFIG-RULE()



NAME
       put-config-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  or  updates an Config rule for evaluating whether your Amazon Web
       Services resources comply with your desired configurations.

       You can use this action for custom  Config  rules  and  Config  managed
       rules. A custom Config rule is a rule that you develop and maintain. An
       Config managed rule is a customizable, predefined rule that Config pro-
       vides.

       If  you  are adding a new custom Config rule, you must first create the
       Lambda function that the rule invokes to evaluate your resources.  When
       you  use  the  PutConfigRule action to add the rule to Config, you must
       specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that Lambda assigns to the func-
       tion. Specify the ARN for the SourceIdentifier key. This key is part of
       the Source object, which is part of the ConfigRule object.

       If you are adding an Config managed rule, specify the rule's identifier
       for  the SourceIdentifier key. To reference Config managed rule identi-
       fiers, see About Config managed rules .

       For any new rule that you add, specify the ConfigRuleName in the Confi-
       gRule  object.  Do  not specify the ConfigRuleArn or the ConfigRuleId .
       These values are generated by Config for new rules.

       If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you  can  specify
       the  rule  by  ConfigRuleName  , ConfigRuleId , or ConfigRuleArn in the
       ConfigRule data type that you use in this request.

       The maximum number of rules that Config supports is 150.

       For information about requesting a rule limit increase, see Config Lim-
       its in the Amazon Web Services General Reference Guide .

       For  more  information  about  developing  and  using Config rules, see
       Evaluating Amazon Web Services resource Configurations with  Config  in
       the Config Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            put-config-rule
          --config-rule <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --config-rule (structure)
          The rule that you want to add to your account.

          ConfigRuleName -> (string)
              The  name  that  you  assign to the Config rule. The name is re-
              quired if you are adding a new rule.

          ConfigRuleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Config rule.

          ConfigRuleId -> (string)
              The ID of the Config rule.

          Description -> (string)
              The description that you provide for the Config rule.

          Scope -> (structure)
              Defines which resources can trigger an evaluation for the  rule.
              The  scope can include one or more resource types, a combination
              of one resource type and one resource ID, or a combination of  a
              tag  key  and  value. Specify a scope to constrain the resources
              that can trigger an evaluation for the rule. If you do not spec-
              ify  a scope, evaluations are triggered when any resource in the
              recording group changes.

              NOTE:
                 The scope can be empty.

              ComplianceResourceTypes -> (list)
                 The resource types of only  those  Amazon  Web  Services  re-
                 sources  that you want to trigger an evaluation for the rule.
                 You can only specify one type if you also specify a  resource
                 ID for ComplianceResourceId .

                 (string)

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The tag key that is applied to only those Amazon Web Services
                 resources that you want to  trigger  an  evaluation  for  the
                 rule.

              TagValue -> (string)
                 The  tag  value applied to only those Amazon Web Services re-
                 sources that you want to trigger an evaluation for the  rule.
                 If you specify a value for TagValue , you must also specify a
                 value for TagKey .

              ComplianceResourceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the only Amazon Web Services resource that you want
                 to  trigger  an evaluation for the rule. If you specify a re-
                 source ID, you must specify one  resource  type  for  Compli-
                 anceResourceTypes .

          Source -> (structure)
              Provides  the  rule owner (Amazon Web Services or customer), the
              rule identifier, and the notifications that cause  the  function
              to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.

              Owner -> (string)
                 Indicates  whether  Amazon  Web Services or the customer owns
                 and manages the Config rule.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 For Config managed rules,  a  predefined  identifier  from  a
                 list.  For example, IAM_PASSWORD_POLICY is a managed rule. To
                 reference a managed rule, see Using Config managed rules .

                 For custom rules, the identifier is the Amazon Resource  Name
                 (ARN)    of    the    rule's   Lambda   function,   such   as
                 arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:cus-
                 tom_rule_name .

              SourceDetails -> (list)
                 Provides  the source and type of the event that causes Config
                 to evaluate your Amazon Web Services resources.

                 (structure)
                     Provides the source and the message  types  that  trigger
                     Config  to  evaluate  your  Amazon Web Services resources
                     against a rule. It also provides the frequency with which
                     you  want  Config  to run evaluations for the rule if the
                     trigger type is periodic. You can specify  the  parameter
                     values for SourceDetail only for custom rules.

                     EventSource -> (string)
                        The  source  of  the event, such as an Amazon Web Ser-
                        vices service, that triggers Config to  evaluate  your
                        Amazon Web Services resources.

                     MessageType -> (string)
                        The  type  of notification that triggers Config to run
                        an evaluation for a rule. You can specify the  follow-
                        ing notification types:

                        o ConfigurationItemChangeNotification  -  Triggers  an
                          evaluation when Config delivers a configuration item
                          as a result of a resource change.

                        o OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification - Trig-
                          gers an evaluation when Config delivers an oversized
                          configuration item. Config may generate this notifi-
                          cation type when a resource changes and the  notifi-
                          cation  exceeds  the  maximum size allowed by Amazon
                          SNS.

                        o ScheduledNotification - Triggers a periodic  evalua-
                          tion  at  the  frequency specified for MaximumExecu-
                          tionFrequency .

                        o ConfigurationSnapshotDeliveryCompleted - Triggers  a
                          periodic  evaluation when Config delivers a configu-
                          ration snapshot.

                        If you want your custom rule to be triggered  by  con-
                        figuration  changes, specify two SourceDetail objects,
                        one for  ConfigurationItemChangeNotification  and  one
                        for OversizedConfigurationItemChangeNotification .

                     MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
                        The  frequency at which you want Config to run evalua-
                        tions for a custom rule with a  periodic  trigger.  If
                        you  specify  a  value for MaximumExecutionFrequency ,
                        then MessageType must  use  the  ScheduledNotification
                        value.

                        NOTE:
                            By  default,  rules  with  a  periodic trigger are
                            evaluated every 24 hours. To change the frequency,
                            specify a valid value for the MaximumExecutionFre-
                            quency parameter.

                            Based on the valid value you choose,  Config  runs
                            evaluations  once  for each valid value. For exam-
                            ple, if you choose Three_Hours , Config runs eval-
                            uations  once  every  three  hours.  In this case,
                            Three_Hours is the frequency of this rule.

          InputParameters -> (string)
              A string, in JSON format, that is  passed  to  the  Config  rule
              Lambda function.

          MaximumExecutionFrequency -> (string)
              The  maximum  frequency with which Config runs evaluations for a
              rule. You can  specify  a  value  for  MaximumExecutionFrequency
              when:

              o You  are  using  an Config managed rule that is triggered at a
                periodic frequency.

              o Your custom rule is triggered when Config delivers the config-
                uration snapshot. For more information, see  ConfigSnapshotDe-
                liveryProperties .

              NOTE:
                 By default, rules with a periodic trigger are evaluated every
                 24  hours. To change the frequency, specify a valid value for
                 the MaximumExecutionFrequency parameter.

          ConfigRuleState -> (string)
              Indicates whether the Config rule is active or is currently  be-
              ing  deleted by Config. It can also indicate the evaluation sta-
              tus for the Config rule.

              Config sets the state of the rule to EVALUATING temporarily  af-
              ter  you  use the StartConfigRulesEvaluation request to evaluate
              your resources against the Config rule.

              Config sets the state of the rule to DELETING_RESULTS  temporar-
              ily  after you use the DeleteEvaluationResults request to delete
              the current evaluation results for the Config rule.

              Config temporarily sets the state of a rule  to  DELETING  after
              you  use  the DeleteConfigRule request to delete the rule. After
              Config deletes the rule, the rule and all of its evaluations are
              erased and are no longer available.

          CreatedBy -> (string)
              Service principal name of the service that created the rule.

              NOTE:
                 The  field  is  populated  only if the service linked rule is
                 created by a service. The field is empty if you  create  your
                 own rule.

          }

       --tags (list)
          An array of tag object.

          (structure)
              The  tags for the resource. The metadata that you apply to a re-
              source to help you categorize and organize them. Each  tag  con-
              sists  of a key and an optional value, both of which you define.
              Tag keys can have a maximum character length of 128  characters,
              and tag values can have a maximum length of 256 characters.

              Key -> (string)
                 One  part  of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A key is a
                 general label that acts like a category for more specific tag
                 values.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  optional  part of a key-value pair that make up a tag. A
                 value acts as a descriptor within a tag category (key).

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To add an AWS managed Config rule

       The following command provides JSON code to add an AWS  managed  Config
       rule:

          aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://RequiredTagsForEC2Instances.json

       RequiredTagsForEC2Instances.json  is a JSON file that contains the rule
       configuration:

          {
            "ConfigRuleName": "RequiredTagsForEC2Instances",
            "Description": "Checks whether the CostCenter and Owner tags are applied to EC2 instances.",
            "Scope": {
              "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
                "AWS::EC2::Instance"
              ]
            },
            "Source": {
              "Owner": "AWS",
              "SourceIdentifier": "REQUIRED_TAGS"
            },
            "InputParameters": "{\"tag1Key\":\"CostCenter\",\"tag2Key\":\"Owner\"}"
          }

       For the ComplianceResourceTypes attribute, this JSON  code  limits  the
       scope  to  resources of the AWS::EC2::Instance type, so AWS Config will
       evaluate only EC2 instances against the rule. Because  the  rule  is  a
       managed  rule, the Owner attribute is set to AWS, and the SourceIdenti-
       fier attribute is set to the rule identifier,  REQUIRED_TAGS.  For  the
       InputParameters  attribute,  the tag keys that the rule requires, Cost-
       Center and Owner, are specified.

       If the command succeeds, AWS Config returns no output.  To  verify  the
       rule  configuration, run the describe-config-rules command, and specify
       the rule name.

       To add a customer managed Config rule

       The following command provides JSON code to add a customer managed Con-
       fig rule:

          aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule file://InstanceTypesAreT2micro.json

       InstanceTypesAreT2micro.json is a JSON file that contains the rule con-
       figuration:

          {
            "ConfigRuleName": "InstanceTypesAreT2micro",
            "Description": "Evaluates whether EC2 instances are the t2.micro type.",
            "Scope": {
              "ComplianceResourceTypes": [
                "AWS::EC2::Instance"
              ]
            },
            "Source": {
              "Owner": "CUSTOM_LAMBDA",
              "SourceIdentifier": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:InstanceTypeCheck",
              "SourceDetails": [
                {
                  "EventSource": "aws.config",
                  "MessageType": "ConfigurationItemChangeNotification"
                }
              ]
            },
            "InputParameters": "{\"desiredInstanceType\":\"t2.micro\"}"
          }

       For the ComplianceResourceTypes attribute, this JSON  code  limits  the
       scope  to  resources of the AWS::EC2::Instance type, so AWS Config will
       evaluate only EC2 instances against the rule. Because this  rule  is  a
       customer managed rule, the Owner attribute is set to CUSTOM_LAMBDA, and
       the SourceIdentifier attribute is set to the  ARN  of  the  AWS  Lambda
       function. The SourceDetails object is required. The parameters that are
       specified for the InputParameters  attribute  are  passed  to  the  AWS
       Lambda  function  when  AWS  Config  invokes  it  to evaluate resources
       against the rule.

       If the command succeeds, AWS Config returns no output.  To  verify  the
       rule  configuration, run the describe-config-rules command, and specify
       the rule name.

OUTPUT
       None
