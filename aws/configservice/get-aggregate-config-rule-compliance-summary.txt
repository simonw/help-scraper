       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-aggregate-config-rule-compliance-summary
          --configuration-aggregator-name <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--group-by-key <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-aggregator-name (string)
          The name of the configuration aggregator.

       --filters (structure)
          Filters  the results based on the ConfigRuleComplianceSummaryFilters
          object.

          AccountId -> (string)
              The 12-digit account ID of the source account.

          AwsRegion -> (string)
              The source region where the data is aggregated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AccountId=string,AwsRegion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AccountId": "string",
            "AwsRegion": "string"
          }

       --group-by-key (string)
          Groups the result based on ACCOUNT_ID or AWS_REGION.

          Possible values:

          o ACCOUNT_ID

          o AWS_REGION

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of evaluation results returned on each page.  The
          default  is  1000. You cannot specify a number greater than 1000. If
          you specify 0, Config uses the default.

       --next-token (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
