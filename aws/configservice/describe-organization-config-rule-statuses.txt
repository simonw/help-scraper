DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-DESCRIBE-ORGANIZATION-CONFIG-RULE-STATUSES()



NAME
       describe-organization-config-rule-statuses -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  organization  config  rule deployment status for an organiza-
       tion.

       NOTE:
          The status is not considered successful  until  organization  config
          rule is successfully deployed in all the member accounts with an ex-
          ception of excluded accounts.

          When you specify the limit and the next token, you receive  a  pagi-
          nated response. Limit and next token are not applicable if you spec-
          ify organization config rule names. It is only applicable, when  you
          request all the organization config rules.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-organization-config-rule-statuses  is  a  paginated operation.
       Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the  entire  data
       set  of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-pagi-
       nate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following  query  expressions:  OrganizationConfigRuleSta-
       tuses

SYNOPSIS
            describe-organization-config-rule-statuses
          [--organization-config-rule-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --organization-config-rule-names (list)
          The names of organization config rules for which you want status de-
          tails. If you do not specify any names, Config returns  details  for
          all your organization Config rules.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OrganizationConfigRuleStatuses -> (list)
          A list of OrganizationConfigRuleStatus objects.

          (structure)
              Returns the status for an organization config rule in an organi-
              zation.

              OrganizationConfigRuleName -> (string)
                 The name that you assign to organization config rule.

              OrganizationRuleStatus -> (string)
                 Indicates deployment status of an organization  config  rule.
                 When  master  account  calls PutOrganizationConfigRule action
                 for the first time, config rule status is created in all  the
                 member  accounts.  When master account calls PutOrganization-
                 ConfigRule action for the second time, config rule status  is
                 updated in all the member accounts. Additionally, config rule
                 status is updated when one or more member  accounts  join  or
                 leave an organization. Config rule status is deleted when the
                 master account deletes OrganizationConfigRule in all the mem-
                 ber  accounts and disables service access for config-multiac-
                 countsetup.amazonaws.com .

                 Config sets the state of the rule to:

                 o CREATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully created in all the member accounts.

                 o CREATE_IN_PROGRESS  when  an  organization config rule cre-
                   ation is in progress.

                 o CREATE_FAILED when an  organization  config  rule  creation
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

                 o DELETE_FAILED when an  organization  config  rule  deletion
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

                 o DELETE_IN_PROGRESS when an organization config  rule  dele-
                   tion is in progress.

                 o DELETE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully deleted from all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_SUCCESSFUL when an organization config rule has been
                   successfully updated in all the member accounts.

                 o UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS  when an organization config rule update
                   is in progress.

                 o UPDATE_FAILED  when  an  organization  config  rule  update
                   failed in one or more member accounts within that organiza-
                   tion.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 An error code that is returned when organization config  rule
                 creation or deletion has failed.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 An  error  message  indicating  that organization config rule
                 creation or deletion failed due to an error.

              LastUpdateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The timestamp of the last update.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The nextToken string returned on a previous page that you use to get
          the next page of results in a paginated response.
