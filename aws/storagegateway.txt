NAME
       storagegateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Storage  Gateway  is  the service that connects an on-premises software
       appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure inte-
       gration  between  an  organization's on-premises IT environment and the
       Amazon Web Services storage infrastructure. The service enables you  to
       securely  upload  data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effec-
       tive backup and rapid disaster recovery.

       Use the following links to get started using the Storage  Gateway  Ser-
       vice API Reference :

       o Storage  Gateway  required  request  headers : Describes the required
         headers that you must send with every POST request to  Storage  Gate-
         way.

       o Signing requests : Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate ev-
         ery request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.

       o Error responses : Provides reference information about Storage  Gate-
         way errors.

       o Operations in Storage Gateway : Contains detailed descriptions of all
         Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters,  response  ele-
         ments, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.

       o Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas : Provides a list of each Amazon
         Web Services Region and the endpoints available for use with  Storage
         Gateway.

       NOTE:
          Storage  Gateway  resource  IDs are in uppercase. When you use these
          resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects  resource  IDs  in
          lowercase.  You  must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it
          with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a  vol-
          ume  might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670 . When you use this ID with the
          EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670  .  Otherwise,
          the EC2 API might not behave as expected.

       WARNING:
          IDs  for  Storage  Gateway  volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created
          from gateway volumes are changing to a longer  format.  Starting  in
          December  2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a
          17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use
          these  longer  IDs so you can test your systems with the new format.
          For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs .

          For example, a volume Amazon Resource Name  (ARN)  with  the  longer
          volume ID format looks like the following:
              arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gate-
              way/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG .

          A snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks  like  the  following:
          snap-78e226633445566ee .

          For  more  information,  see  Announcement: Heads-up  Longer Storage
          Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016 .
