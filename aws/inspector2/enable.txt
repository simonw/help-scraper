SYNOPSIS
            enable
          [--account-ids <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --resource-types <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-ids (list)
          A list of account IDs you want to enable Amazon Inspector scans for.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --client-token (string)
          The idempotency token for the request.

       --resource-types (list)
          The resource scan types you want to enable.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            EC2
            ECR

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
