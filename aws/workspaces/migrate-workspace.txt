MIGRATE-WORKSPACE()                                        MIGRATE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       migrate-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Migrates  a  WorkSpace  from one operating system or bundle type to an-
       other, while retaining the data on the user volume.

       The migration process recreates the WorkSpace by using a new root  vol-
       ume  from  the  target  bundle  image and the user volume from the last
       available snapshot of the original  WorkSpace.  During  migration,  the
       original   D:\Users\%USERNAME%   user  profile  folder  is  renamed  to
       D:\Users\%USERNAME%MMddyyTHHmmss%.NotMigrated . A  new  D:\Users\%USER-
       NAME%\ folder is generated by the new OS. Certain files in the old user
       profile are moved to the new user profile.

       For available migration scenarios, details about  what  happens  during
       migration, and best practices, see Migrate a WorkSpace .

SYNOPSIS
            migrate-workspace
          --source-workspace-id <value>
          --bundle-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-workspace-id (string)
          The identifier of the WorkSpace to migrate from.

       --bundle-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the target bundle type to migrate the WorkSpace
          to.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To migrate a WorkSpace

       The   following   migrate-workspace   example  migrates  the  specified
       WorkSpace to the Standard with Windows 10 (English) public bundle type.

          aws workspaces migrate-workspace \
              --source-workspace-id ws-12345678 \
              --bundle-id wsb-8vbljg4r6

       Output:

          {
              "SourceWorkspaceId": "ws-12345678",
              "TargetWorkspaceId": "ws-87654321"
          }

OUTPUT
       SourceWorkspaceId -> (string)
          The original identifier of the WorkSpace that is being migrated.

       TargetWorkspaceId -> (string)
          The new identifier of the WorkSpace that is being migrated.  If  the
          migration  does  not  succeed,  the  target WorkSpace ID will not be
          used, and the WorkSpace will still have the original WorkSpace ID.
