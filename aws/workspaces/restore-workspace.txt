RESTORE-WORKSPACE()                                        RESTORE-WORKSPACE()



NAME
       restore-workspace -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores the specified WorkSpace to its last known healthy state.

       You  cannot restore a WorkSpace unless its state is AVAILABLE , ERROR ,
       UNHEALTHY , or STOPPED .

       Restoring a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can  re-
       sult in the loss of data. For more information, see Restore a WorkSpace
       .

       This operation is asynchronous and returns before the WorkSpace is com-
       pletely restored.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            restore-workspace
          --workspace-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workspace-id (string)
          The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
