SYNOPSIS
            describe-account
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DedicatedTenancySupport -> (string)
          The status of BYOL (whether BYOL is enabled or disabled).

       DedicatedTenancyManagementCidrRange -> (string)
          The  IP address range, specified as an IPv4 CIDR block, used for the
          management network interface.

          The management network interface is connected  to  a  secure  Amazon
          WorkSpaces  management network. It is used for interactive streaming
          of the WorkSpace desktop to Amazon WorkSpaces clients, and to  allow
          Amazon WorkSpaces to manage the WorkSpace.
