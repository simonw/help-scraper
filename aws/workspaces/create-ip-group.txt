CREATE-IP-GROUP()                                            CREATE-IP-GROUP()



NAME
       create-ip-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an IP access control group.

       An IP access control group provides you with the ability to control the
       IP addresses from which users are allowed to access  their  WorkSpaces.
       To specify the CIDR address ranges, add rules to your IP access control
       group and then associate the group with your  directory.  You  can  add
       rules  when you create the group or at any time using  AuthorizeIpRules
       .

       There is a default IP access control group associated with your  direc-
       tory.  If  you don't associate an IP access control group with your di-
       rectory, the default group is used. The default group  includes  a  de-
       fault  rule that allows users to access their WorkSpaces from anywhere.
       You cannot modify the default IP access control group for  your  direc-
       tory.

OPTIONS

          The description of the group.

       --user-rules (list)
          The rules to add to the group.

          (structure)

              ipRule -> (string)
                 The IP address range, in CIDR notation.

              ruleDesc -> (string)
                 The description.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ipRule=string,ruleDesc=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ipRule": "string",
              "ruleDesc": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          The tags. Each WorkSpaces resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GroupId -> (string)
          The identifier of the group.
