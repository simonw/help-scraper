REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()                  REGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       register-workspace-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  the  specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and
       returns before the WorkSpace directory is registered. If  this  is  the
       first time you are registering a directory, you will need to create the
       workspaces_DefaultRole role before you can register  a  directory.  For
       more information, see Creating the workspaces_DefaultRole Role .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-workspace-directory
          --directory-id <value>
          [--subnet-ids <value>]
          --enable-work-docs | --no-enable-work-docs
          [--enable-self-service | --no-enable-self-service]
          [--tenancy <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier of the directory. You cannot register a directory if
          it does not have a status of Active. If the directory does not  have
          a  status  of Active, you will receive an InvalidResourceStateExcep-
          tion error. If you have already registered the maximum number of di-
          rectories that you can register with Amazon WorkSpaces, you will re-
          ceive a ResourceLimitExceededException error. Deregister directories
          that you are not using for WorkSpaces, and try again.

       --subnet-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the subnets for your virtual private cloud (VPC).
          Make sure that the subnets are in supported Availability Zones.  The
          subnets must also be in separate Availability Zones. If these condi-
          tions are not met, you will receive  an  OperationNotSupportedExcep-
          tion error.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --enable-work-docs | --no-enable-work-docs (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  Amazon  WorkDocs  is enabled or disabled. If you
          have enabled this parameter and WorkDocs is not available in the Re-
          gion,  you will receive an OperationNotSupportedException error. Set
          EnableWorkDocs to disabled, and try again.

       --enable-self-service | --no-enable-self-service (boolean)
          Indicates whether self-service capabilities are enabled or disabled.

       --tenancy (string)
          Indicates whether your WorkSpace directory is dedicated  or  shared.
          To  use Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images, this value must be set
          to DEDICATED and your Amazon Web Services account  must  be  enabled
          for  BYOL.  If  your account has not been enabled for BYOL, you will
          receive an InvalidParameterValuesException error. For more  informa-
          tion about BYOL images, see Bring Your Own Windows Desktop Images .

          Possible values:

          o DEDICATED

          o SHARED

       --tags (list)
          The tags associated with the directory.

          (structure)
              Describes a tag.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
