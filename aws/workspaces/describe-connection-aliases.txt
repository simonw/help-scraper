NAME
       describe-connection-aliases -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  that  describes  the  connection  aliases  used for
       cross-Region redirection. For more information, see Cross-Region  Redi-
       rection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-connection-aliases
          [--alias-ids <value>]
          [--resource-id <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --alias-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the connection aliases to describe.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  directory  associated  with the connection
          alias.

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of connection aliases to return.

       --next-token (string)
          If you received a NextToken from a previous call that was paginated,
          provide this token to receive the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConnectionAliases -> (list)
          Information about the specified connection aliases.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  connection  alias. Connection aliases are used for
              cross-Region redirection. For more information, see Cross-Region
              Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

              ConnectionString -> (string)
                 The connection string specified for the connection alias. The
                 connection string must be in the form of  a  fully  qualified
                 domain name (FQDN), such as www.example.com .

              AliasId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the connection alias.

              State -> (string)
                 The current state of the connection alias.

              OwnerAccountId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of the Amazon Web Services account that owns
                 the connection alias.

              Associations -> (list)
                 The association status of the connection alias.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a connection alias association that is used for
                     cross-Region   redirection.  For  more  information,  see
                     Cross-Region Redirection for Amazon WorkSpaces .

                     AssociationStatus -> (string)
                        The association status of the connection alias.

                     AssociatedAccountId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the Amazon Web Services account that
                        associated the connection alias with a directory.

                     ResourceId -> (string)
                        The identifier of the directory associated with a con-
                        nection alias.

                     ConnectionIdentifier -> (string)
                        The identifier of the  connection  alias  association.
                        You  use  the  connection  identifier  in  the DNS TXT
                        record when you're configuring your DNS routing  poli-
                        cies.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
