LIST-AVAILABLE-MANAGEMENT-CIDR-RANGES()LIST-AVAILABLE-MANAGEMENT-CIDR-RANGES()



NAME
       list-available-management-cidr-ranges -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list of IP address ranges, specified as IPv4 CIDR blocks,
       that you can use for the network management interface when  you  enable
       Bring Your Own License (BYOL).

       This operation can be run only by Amazon Web Services accounts that are
       enabled for BYOL. If your account isn't enabled for  BYOL,  you'll  re-
       ceive an AccessDeniedException error.

       The  management  network  interface  is  connected  to  a secure Amazon
       WorkSpaces management network. It is used for interactive streaming  of
       the WorkSpace desktop to Amazon WorkSpaces clients, and to allow Amazon
       WorkSpaces to manage the WorkSpace.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-available-management-cidr-ranges is a paginated operation.  Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: ManagementCidrRanges

SYNOPSIS
            list-available-management-cidr-ranges
          --management-cidr-range-constraint <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --management-cidr-range-constraint (string)
          The  IP address range to search. Specify an IP address range that is
          compatible with your network and in CIDR notation (that is,  specify
          the range as an IPv4 CIDR block).

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ManagementCidrRanges -> (list)
          The  list  of  available  IP  address ranges, specified as IPv4 CIDR
          blocks.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
