NAME
       describe-workspace-directories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  available  directories  that are registered with Amazon
       WorkSpaces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-workspace-directories is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Directories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspace-directories
          [--directory-ids <value>]
          [--limit <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the directories. If the value is null, all direc-
          tories are retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of directories to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Directories -> (list)
          Information about the directories.

          (structure)
              Describes a directory that is used with Amazon WorkSpaces.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory identifier.

              Alias -> (string)
                 The directory alias.

              DirectoryName -> (string)
                 The name of the directory.

              RegistrationCode -> (string)
                 The  registration  code  for  the directory. This is the code
                 that users enter in their Amazon WorkSpaces  client  applica-
                 tion to connect to the directory.

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 The identifiers of the subnets used with the directory.

                 (string)

              DnsIpAddresses -> (list)
                 The IP addresses of the DNS servers for the directory.

                 (string)

              CustomerUserName -> (string)
                 The user name for the service account.

              IamRoleId -> (string)
                 The  identifier of the IAM role. This is the role that allows
                 Amazon WorkSpaces to make calls to other  services,  such  as
                 Amazon EC2, on your behalf.

              DirectoryType -> (string)
                 The directory type.

              WorkspaceSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                 The  identifier of the security group that is assigned to new
                 WorkSpaces.

              State -> (string)
                 The  state  of  the  directory's  registration  with   Amazon
                 WorkSpaces.  After  a directory is deregistered, the DEREGIS-
                 TERED state is returned very  briefly  before  the  directory
                 metadata  is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned. To
                 confirm that a directory is deregistered, check for  the  di-
                 rectory ID by using DescribeWorkspaceDirectories . If the di-
                 rectory ID isn't returned, then the directory has  been  suc-
                 cessfully deregistered.

              WorkspaceCreationProperties -> (structure)
                 The default creation properties for all WorkSpaces in the di-
                 rectory.

                 EnableWorkDocs -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether the directory  is  enabled  for  Amazon
                     WorkDocs.

                 EnableInternetAccess -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether to automatically assign an Elastic pub-
                     lic IP address to WorkSpaces in  this  directory  by  de-
                     fault.  If  enabled, the Elastic public IP address allows
                     outbound internet access from your WorkSpaces when  youre
                     using an internet gateway in the Amazon VPC in which your
                     WorkSpaces are located. If you're using a Network Address
                     Translation  (NAT)  gateway  for outbound internet access
                     from your VPC, or if your WorkSpaces are in  public  sub-
                     nets  and  you manually assign them Elastic IP addresses,
                     you should disable this setting. This setting applies  to
                     new  WorkSpaces that you launch or to existing WorkSpaces
                     that you rebuild. For more information, see  Configure  a
                     VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces .

                 DefaultOu -> (string)
                     The  organizational  unit  (OU)  in the directory for the
                     WorkSpace machine accounts.

                 CustomSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                     The identifier of the default security group to apply  to
                     WorkSpaces  when  they are created. For more information,
                     see Security Groups for Your WorkSpaces .

                 UserEnabledAsLocalAdministrator -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether WorkSpace users are  local  administra-
                     tors on their WorkSpaces.

                 EnableMaintenanceMode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies   whether   maintenance  mode  is  enabled  for
                     WorkSpaces. For more information, see  WorkSpace  Mainte-
                     nance .

              ipGroupIds -> (list)
                 The  identifiers  of  the IP access control groups associated
                 with the directory.
