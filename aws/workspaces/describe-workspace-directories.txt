NAME
       describe-workspace-directories -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  available  directories  that are registered with Amazon
       WorkSpaces.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-workspace-directories is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: Directories

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspace-directories

OPTIONS
       --directory-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the directories. If the value is null, all direc-
          tories are retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --limit (integer)
          The maximum number of directories to return.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Directories -> (list)
          Information about the directories.

          (structure)
              Describes a directory that is used with Amazon WorkSpaces.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The directory identifier.

              RegistrationCode -> (string)
                 The registration code for the directory.  This  is  the  code
                 that  users  enter in their Amazon WorkSpaces client applica-
                 tion to connect to the directory.

              SubnetIds -> (list)
                 The identifiers of the subnets used with the directory.

                 (string)

              DnsIpAddresses -> (list)
                 The IP addresses of the DNS servers for the directory.

              IamRoleId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the IAM role. This is the role that  allows
                 Amazon  WorkSpaces  to  make calls to other services, such as
                 Amazon EC2, on your behalf.

              DirectoryType -> (string)
                 The directory type.

              WorkspaceSecurityGroupId -> (string)

                 The   state  of  the  directory's  registration  with  Amazon
                 WorkSpaces. After a directory is deregistered,  the  DEREGIS-
                 TERED  state  is  returned  very briefly before the directory
                 metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.  To
                 confirm  that  a directory is deregistered, check for the di-
                 rectory ID by using DescribeWorkspaceDirectories . If the di-
                 rectory  ID  isn't returned, then the directory has been suc-
                 cessfully deregistered.

              WorkspaceCreationProperties -> (structure)
                 The default creation properties for all WorkSpaces in the di-
                 rectory.

                 EnableWorkDocs -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the  directory  is enabled for Amazon
                     WorkDocs.

                 EnableInternetAccess -> (boolean)
                     Specifies whether to automatically assign an Elastic pub-
                     lic  IP  address  to  WorkSpaces in this directory by de-
                     fault. If enabled, the Elastic public IP  address  allows
                     outbound  internet access from your WorkSpaces when youre
                     using an internet gateway in the Amazon VPC in which your
                     WorkSpaces are located. If you're using a Network Address
                     Translation (NAT) gateway for  outbound  internet  access
                     from  your  VPC, or if your WorkSpaces are in public sub-
                     nets and you manually assign them Elastic  IP  addresses,
                     you  should disable this setting. This setting applies to
                     new WorkSpaces that you launch or to existing  WorkSpaces
                     that  you  rebuild. For more information, see Configure a
                     VPC for Amazon WorkSpaces .

                     The organizational unit (OU) in  the  directory  for  the
                     WorkSpace machine accounts.

                 CustomSecurityGroupId -> (string)
                     The  identifier of the default security group to apply to
                     WorkSpaces when they are created. For  more  information,
                     see Security Groups for Your WorkSpaces .

                 UserEnabledAsLocalAdministrator -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  WorkSpace users are local administra-
                     tors on their WorkSpaces.

                 EnableMaintenanceMode -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  maintenance  mode  is   enabled   for

                       cess URL on supported client applications, but will not
                       prevent  clients that do not support SAML 2.0 authenti-
                       cation from connecting as if  SAML  2.0  authentication
                       was disabled.

                 UserAccessUrl -> (string)
                     The  SAML  2.0 identity provider (IdP) user access URL is
                     the URL a user would navigate to in their web browser  in
                     order  to  federate  from the IdP and directly access the
                     application, without any SAML 2.0 service  provider  (SP)
                     bindings.

                 RelayStateParameterName -> (string)
                     The  relay state parameter name supported by the SAML 2.0
                     identity provider (IdP). When the end user is  redirected
                     to  the user access URL from the WorkSpaces client appli-
                     cation, this relay state parameter name is appended as  a
                     query  parameter  to  the  URL along with the relay state
                     endpoint to return the user  to  the  client  application
                     session.

                     To  use  SAML 2.0 authentication with WorkSpaces, the IdP
                     must support IdP-initiated deep  linking  for  the  relay
                     state URL. Consult your IdP documentation for more infor-
                     mation.

                 The certificate-based authentication properties used  to  au-
                 thenticate  SAML  2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) user identities
                 to Active Directory for WorkSpaces login.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the certificate-based authentication  prop-
                     erties.

                     Certificate Manager Private CA resource.

          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results. This value is
          null when there are no more results to return.
