REBUILD-WORKSPACES()                                      REBUILD-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       rebuild-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Rebuilds the specified WorkSpace.

       You  cannot rebuild a WorkSpace unless its state is AVAILABLE , ERROR ,
       UNHEALTHY , STOPPED , or REBOOTING .

       Rebuilding a WorkSpace is a potentially destructive action that can re-
       sult in the loss of data. For more information, see Rebuild a WorkSpace
       .

       This operation is asynchronous and returns before the  WorkSpaces  have
       been completely rebuilt.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            rebuild-workspaces
          --rebuild-workspace-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --rebuild-workspace-requests (list)
          The WorkSpace to rebuild. You can specify a single WorkSpace.

          (structure)
              Describes the information used to rebuild a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --rebuild-workspace-requests WorkspaceId1

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "WorkspaceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedRequests -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpace that could not be rebuilt.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace that could  not  be  rebooted.  (  Reboot-
              Workspaces ), rebuilt ( RebuildWorkspaces ), restored ( Restore-
              Workspace ),  terminated  (  TerminateWorkspaces  ),  started  (
              StartWorkspaces ), or stopped ( StopWorkspaces ).

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  that is returned if the WorkSpace cannot be
                 rebooted.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of  the  error  message  that  is  returned  if  the
                 WorkSpace cannot be rebooted.
