REBOOT-WORKSPACES()                                        REBOOT-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       reboot-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Reboots the specified WorkSpaces.

       You  cannot  reboot  a  WorkSpace  unless its state is AVAILABLE or UN-
       HEALTHY .

       This operation is asynchronous and returns before the  WorkSpaces  have
       rebooted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            reboot-workspaces
          --reboot-workspace-requests <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --reboot-workspace-requests (list)
          The WorkSpaces to reboot. You can specify up to 25 WorkSpaces.

          (structure)
              Describes the information used to reboot a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          --reboot-workspace-requests WorkspaceId1 WorkspaceId2 WorkspaceId3

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "WorkspaceId": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FailedRequests -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpaces that could not be rebooted.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  WorkSpace  that  could  not be rebooted. ( Reboot-
              Workspaces ), rebuilt ( RebuildWorkspaces ), restored ( Restore-
              Workspace  ),  terminated  (  TerminateWorkspaces  ),  started (
              StartWorkspaces ), or stopped ( StopWorkspaces ).

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code that is returned if the  WorkSpace  cannot  be
                 rebooted.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The  text  of  the  error  message  that  is  returned if the
                 WorkSpace cannot be rebooted.
