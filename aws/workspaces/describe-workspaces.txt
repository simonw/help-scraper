DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()                                    DESCRIBE-WORKSPACES()



NAME
       describe-workspaces -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the specified WorkSpaces.

       You  can  filter  the results by using the bundle identifier, directory
       identifier, or owner, but you can specify only one filter at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-workspaces is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Workspaces

SYNOPSIS
            describe-workspaces
          [--workspace-ids <value>]
          [--directory-id <value>]
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--bundle-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --workspace-ids (list)
          The identifiers of the WorkSpaces. You cannot combine this parameter
          with any other filter.

          Because the  CreateWorkspaces operation is asynchronous, the identi-
          fier  it  returns  is  not immediately available. If you immediately
          call  DescribeWorkspaces with this identifier, no information is re-
          turned.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --directory-id (string)
          The  identifier  of  the  directory. In addition, you can optionally
          specify a specific directory user (see UserName ). You  cannot  com-
          bine this parameter with any other filter.

       --user-name (string)
          The name of the directory user. You must specify this parameter with
          DirectoryId .

       --bundle-id (string)
          The identifier of the bundle. All WorkSpaces that are  created  from
          this  bundle  are  retrieved. You cannot combine this parameter with
          any other filter.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          }

OUTPUT
       Workspaces -> (list)
          Information about the WorkSpaces.

          Because  CreateWorkspaces is an asynchronous operation, some of  the
          returned information could be incomplete.

          (structure)
              Describes a WorkSpace.

              WorkspaceId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the WorkSpace.

              DirectoryId -> (string)
                 The  identifier  of  the  Directory Service directory for the
                 WorkSpace.

              UserName -> (string)
                 The user for the WorkSpace.

              IpAddress -> (string)
                 The IP address of the WorkSpace.

              State -> (string)
                 The operational state of the WorkSpace.

                 NOTE:
                     After a WorkSpace is terminated, the TERMINATED state  is
                     returned  only  briefly  before  the  WorkSpace directory
                     metadata is cleaned up, so this state is rarely returned.
                     To  confirm that a WorkSpace is terminated, check for the
                     WorkSpace  ID  by  using  DescribeWorkSpaces  .  If   the
                     WorkSpace  ID isn't returned, then the WorkSpace has been
                     successfully terminated.

              BundleId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the bundle used to create the WorkSpace.

              SubnetId -> (string)
                 The identifier of the subnet for the WorkSpace.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The text of  the  error  message  that  is  returned  if  the
                 WorkSpace cannot be created.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The  error  code  that is returned if the WorkSpace cannot be
                 created.

              ComputerName -> (string)
                 The name of the WorkSpace, as seen by the  operating  system.
                 The  format  of  this  name varies. For more information, see
                 Launch a WorkSpace .

              VolumeEncryptionKey -> (string)
                 The symmetric KMS key used to encrypt  data  stored  on  your
                 WorkSpace.  Amazon WorkSpaces does not support asymmetric KMS
                 keys.

              UserVolumeEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the data stored on the user volume  is  en-
                 crypted.

              RootVolumeEncryptionEnabled -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether  the data stored on the root volume is en-
                 crypted.

              WorkspaceProperties -> (structure)
                 The properties of the WorkSpace.

                 RunningMode -> (string)
                     The running mode. For more information,  see  Manage  the
                     WorkSpace Running Mode .

                 RunningModeAutoStopTimeoutInMinutes -> (integer)
                     The  time after a user logs off when WorkSpaces are auto-
                     matically stopped. Configured in 60-minute intervals.

                 RootVolumeSizeGib -> (integer)
                     The size of the root volume.  For  important  information
                     about  how  to  modify the size of the root and user vol-
                     umes, see Modify a WorkSpace .

                 UserVolumeSizeGib -> (integer)
                     The size of the user storage. For  important  information

                     State -> (string)
                        The modification state.
