DEREGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()              DEREGISTER-WORKSPACE-DIRECTORY()



NAME
       deregister-workspace-directory -

DESCRIPTION
       Deregisters the specified directory. This operation is asynchronous and
       returns  before  the  WorkSpace  directory  is  deregistered.  If   any
       WorkSpaces  are  registered to this directory, you must remove them be-
       fore you can deregister the directory.

       NOTE:
          Simple AD and AD Connector are made available to you free of  charge
          to  use  with WorkSpaces. If there are no WorkSpaces being used with
          your Simple AD or AD Connector directory for  30  consecutive  days,
          this  directory will be automatically deregistered for use with Ama-
          zon WorkSpaces, and you will be charged for this  directory  as  per
          the Directory Service pricing terms .

          To  delete  empty  directories,  see  Delete  the Directory for Your
          WorkSpaces . If you delete your Simple AD or AD Connector directory,
          you  can  always  create  a  new  one  when  you want to start using
          WorkSpaces again.

SYNOPSIS
            deregister-workspace-directory
          --directory-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --directory-id (string)
          The identifier of the directory. If any WorkSpaces are registered to
          this  directory,  you must remove them before you deregister the di-
          rectory, or you will receive an  OperationNotSupportedException  er-
          ror.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
