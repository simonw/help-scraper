SEARCH-RESOURCES()                                          SEARCH-RESOURCES()



NAME
       search-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of AWS resource identifiers that matches the specified
       query. The query uses the same format as a resource query in a  Create-
       Group or UpdateGroupQuery operation.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:SearchResources

       o cloudformation:DescribeStacks

       o cloudformation:ListStackResources

       o tag:GetResources

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-resources  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ResourceIdentifiers

SYNOPSIS
            search-resources
          --resource-query <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-query (structure)
          The search query, using the same formats that are supported for  re-
          source group definition. For more information, see  CreateGroup .

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query. You can use the following values:

              o

                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0:  * Specifies that the Query contains
                an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 86)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:`` * Specifies that the ``Query``  parameter
                contains  a JSON string that represents a collection of simple
                tag filters for resource types and tags. The JSON string  uses
                a     syntax     similar     to     the    ``    `GetResources
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__  ``  operation, but
                uses only the ``  `ResourceTypeFilters  <https://docs.aws.ama-
                zon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetRe-
                sources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetResources-request-Re-
                sourceTypeFilters>`__      ``      and      ``     `TagFilters
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptag-
                ging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__ ``  fields.
                If  you  specify  more  than  one tag key, only resources that
                match all tag keys, and at least one value of  each  specified
                tag  key, are returned in your query. If you specify more than
                one value for a tag key, a resource matches the filter  if  it
                has a tag key value that matches *any of the specified values.
                For example, consider the following sample query for resources
                that  have two tags, Stage and Version , with two values each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]   The  re-
                sults of this query could include the following.

                o An   EC2   instance   that   has  the  following  two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An  S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The  query would not include the following items in the results,
              however.

                 o An  EC2  instance  that  has  only   the   following   tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of the
                   tag keys specified in the filter, so it  is  excluded  from
                   the results.

                 o An   RDS   database   that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all  of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an associ-
                   ated value that matches at least one of the specified  val-
                   ues in the filter.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To find resources that match a query

       The  following search-resources example retrieves a list of all AWS re-
       sources that match the specified query.

          aws resource-groups search-resources \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Patch Group\", \"Values\":[\"Dev\"]}]}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-01a23bc45d67890ef",
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)
          The ARNs and resource types of resources that  are  members  of  the
          group that you specified.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and its resource
              type.

              ResourceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::Instance .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter in a subsequent call to the operation to get the  next  part
          of  the  output. You should repeat this until the NextToken response
          element comes back as null .

       QueryErrors -> (list)
          A list of QueryError objects. Each error is an object that  contains
          ErrorCode  and Message structures. Possible values for ErrorCode are
          CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and  CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING
          .

          (structure)
              A  two-part error structure that can occur in ListGroupResources
              or  SearchResources  operations  on  CloudFormation  stack-based
              queries.  The  error occurs if the CloudFormation stack on which
              the query is based either does not exist, or has a  status  that
              renders  the  stack  inactive.  A QueryError occurrence does not
              necessarily mean that AWS Resource Groups could not complete the
              operation,  but  the  resulting  group  might have no member re-
              sources.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 Possible values are CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE and  CLOUD-
                 FORMATION_STACK_NOT_EXISTING .

              Message -> (string)
                 A  message  that explains the ErrorCode value. Messages might
                 state that the specified CloudFormation stack does not  exist
                 (or  no  longer  exists). For CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_INACTIVE ,
                 the message typically states that  the  CloudFormation  stack
                 has  a status that is not (or no longer) active, such as CRE-
                 ATE_FAILED .
