SEARCH-RESOURCES()                                          SEARCH-RESOURCES()



NAME
       search-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of Amazon Web Services resource identifiers that matches
       the specified query. The query uses the same format as a resource query
       in a  CreateGroup or  UpdateGroupQuery operation.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:SearchResources

       o cloudformation:DescribeStacks

       o cloudformation:ListStackResources

       o tag:GetResources

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       search-resources  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: ResourceIdentifiers

OPTIONS
       --resource-query (structure)
          The search query, using the same formats that are supported for  re-
          source group definition. For more information, see  CreateGroup .

          Type -> (string)
              The  type of the query to perform. This can have one of two val-
              ues:

              o

                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that you want the  group
                to  contain  the members of an CloudFormation stack. The Query
                contains a StackIdentifier element with an ARN for a CloudFor-
                mation stack.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 98)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o

                *
                TAG_FILTERS_1_0:  *  Specifies  that you want the group to in-
                clude resource that have tags that match the query.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 100)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search. The contents depends
              on the value of the Type element.

              o ResourceTypeFilters   Applies  to all ResourceQuery objects of
                either Type . This element contains one of the  following  two
                items:

                o The  value AWS::AllSupported . This causes the ResourceQuery
                  to match resources of any resource type that also match  the
                  query.

                o A  list  (a  JSON  array)  of resource type identifiers that
                  limit the query to only resources of  the  specified  types.
                  For  the complete list of resource types that you can use in
                  the array value for ResourceTypeFilters , see Resources  you
                  can  use with Resource Groups and Tag Editor in the Resource
                  Groups User Guide .

              Example: "ResourceTypeFilters":  ["AWS::AllSupported"]  or  "Re-
              sourceTypeFilters": ["AWS::EC2::Instance", "AWS::S3::Bucket"]

              o TagFilters   applicable  only  if Type = TAG_FILTERS_1_0 . The
                Query contains a JSON string that represents a  collection  of
                simple  tag  filters. The JSON string uses a syntax similar to
                the ``  GetResources  ``  operation,  but  uses  only  the  ``
                ResourceTypeFilters  ``  and  ``  TagFilters `` fields. If you
                specify more than one tag key, only resources that  match  all
                tag  keys,  and  at least one value of each specified tag key,
                are returned in your query. If you specify more than one value
                for  a  tag key, a resource matches the filter if it has a tag
                key value that matches any of the specified values. For  exam-
                ple,  consider  the  following sample query for resources that
                have two tags, Stage and  Version  ,  with  two  values  each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]    The re-
                sults of this resource query could include the following.

                o An Amazon EC2 instance that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An   S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The resource query results would not include the following items
              in the results, however.

                 o An  Amazon  EC2  instance  that has only the following tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all of  the
                   tag  keys  specified  in the filter, so it is excluded from
                   the results.

                 o An  RDS  database  that  has  the   following   two   tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an  associ-
                   ated  value that matches at least one of the specified val-
                   ues in the filter.

              Example: "TagFilters": [ { "Key": "Stage", "Values": [  "Gamma",
              "Beta" ] }

              o StackIdentifier    applicable   only  if  Type  =  CLOUDFORMA-
                TION_STACK_1_0 . The value of this parameter is the Amazon Re-
                source  Name (ARN) of the CloudFormation stack whose resources
                you want included in the group.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To find resources that match a query

       The following search-resources example retrieves a list of all AWS  re-
       sources that match the specified query.

          aws resource-groups search-resources \
              --resource-query file://query.json

       Contents of query.json:

          {
              "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
              "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Patch Group\", \"Values\":[\"Dev\"]}]}"
          }

       Output:

          {
              "ResourceIdentifiers": [
                  {
                      "ResourceArn": "arn:aws:ec2:us-west-2:123456789012:instance/i-01a23bc45d67890ef",
                      "ResourceType": "AWS::EC2::Instance"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       ResourceIdentifiers -> (list)
          The  ARNs  and  resource  types of resources that are members of the
          group that you specified.

          (structure)
              A structure that contains the ARN of a resource and its resource
              type.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The resource type of a resource, such as AWS::EC2::Instance .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If present, indicates that more output is available than is included
          in the current response. Use this value in the NextToken request pa-
          rameter  in  a subsequent call to the operation to get the next part
          of the output. You should repeat this until the  NextToken  response
          element comes back as null .

       QueryErrors -> (list)
