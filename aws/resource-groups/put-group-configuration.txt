NAME
       put-group-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Attaches  a  service  configuration to the specified group. This occurs
       asynchronously, and can take time to complete. You can  use   GetGroup-
       Configuration to check the status of the update.
          Minimum permissions

       To run this command, you must have the following permissions:

       o resource-groups:PutGroupConfiguration

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-group-configuration
          [--group <value>]
          [--configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group (string)
          The  name  or  ARN of the resource group with the configuration that
          you want to update.

       --configuration (list)
          The new configuration to associate with the specified group. A  con-
          figuration  associates  the  resource  group with an AWS service and
          specifies how the service can interact with  the  resources  in  the
          group.  A  configuration is an array of  GroupConfigurationItem ele-
          ments.

          For information about the syntax of  a  service  configuration,  see
          Service configurations for resource groups .

          NOTE:
              A  resource  group  can  contain either a Configuration or a Re-
              sourceQuery , but not both.

          (structure)
              An item in a group configuration. A group service  configuration
              can have one or more items. For details about group service con-
              figuration  syntax,  see  Service  configurations  for  resource
              groups .

              Type -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  type  of  group configuration item. Each item
                 must have a unique value for type . For  the  list  of  types
                 that  you can specify for a configuration item, see Supported
                 resource types and parameters .

              Parameters -> (list)
                 A collection of parameters for this group configuration item.
                 For the list of parameters that you can use with each config-
                 uration item type, see Supported resource types  and  parame-
                 ters .

                 (structure)
                     A  parameter  for a group configuration item. For details
                     about group service  configuration  syntax,  see  Service
                     configurations for resource groups .

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the group configuration parameter. For the
                        list of parameters that you can use with each configu-
                        ration item type, see Supported resource types and pa-
                        rameters .

                     Values -> (list)
                        The value or values to be used for the  specified  pa-
                        rameter.  For the list of values you can use with each
                        parameter, see Supported resource types and parameters
                        .

                        (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "string",
              "Parameters": [
                {
                  "Name": "string",
                  "Values": ["string", ...]
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To attach a service configuration to a resource group

       Example 1: The following put-group-configuration example specifies that
       the resource group is to contain only Amazon EC2 capacity  reservations
       for instances in the C5 or M5 families.

          aws resource-groups put-group-configuration \
              --group MyTestGroup \
              --configuration file://config.json

       Contents of config.json:

          [
              {
                  "Type": "AWS::EC2::HostManagement",
                  "Parameters": [
                      {
                          "Name": "allowed-host-families",
                          "Values": [ "c5", "m5" ]
                      },
                          {
                              "Name": "any-host-based-license-configuration",
                              "Values": [ "true" ]
                          }
                  ]
              },
              {
                  "Type": "AWS::ResourceGroups::Generic",
                  "Parameters": [
                      {
                          "Name": "allowed-resource-types",
                          "Values": [ "AWS::EC2::Host" ]
                      },
                      {
                          "Name": "deletion-protection",
                          "Values": [ "UNLESS_EMPTY" ]
                      }
                  ]
              }
          ]

       This command produces no output if successful.

       For more information, see Service configurations for resource groups in
       the Resource Groups API Reference Guide.
