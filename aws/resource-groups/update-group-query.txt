SYNOPSIS
            update-group-query
          [--group-name <value>]
          [--group <value>]
          --resource-query <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --group-name (string)
          Don't use this parameter. Use Group instead.

       --group (string)
          The name or the ARN of the resource group to query.

       --resource-query (structure)
          The resource query to determine which AWS resources are  members  of
          this resource group.

          NOTE:
              A  resource  group  can  contain either a Configuration or a Re-
              sourceQuery , but not both.

          Type -> (string)
              The type of the query. You can use the following values:

              o

                *
                CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the Query  contains
                an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 99)
                Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

              o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:``  * Specifies that the ``Query`` parameter
                contains a JSON string that represents a collection of  simple
                tag  filters for resource types and tags. The JSON string uses
                a    syntax    similar     to     the     ``     `GetResources
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__ ``  operation,  but
                uses  only  the `` `ResourceTypeFilters <https://docs.aws.ama-
                zon.com/resourcegroupstagging/latest/APIReference/API_GetRe-
                sources.html#resourcegrouptagging-GetResources-request-Re-
                sourceTypeFilters>`__     ``      and      ``      `TagFilters
                <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resourcegrouptag-
                ging-GetResources-request-TagFiltersTagFilters>`__  `` fields.
                If you specify more than one  tag  key,  only  resources  that
                match  all  tag keys, and at least one value of each specified
                tag key, are returned in your query. If you specify more  than
                one  value  for a tag key, a resource matches the filter if it
                has a tag key value that matches *any of the specified values.
                For example, consider the following sample query for resources
                that have two tags, Stage and Version , with two values  each:
                [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]    The re-
                sults of this query could include the following.

                o An  EC2  instance  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                  {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                o An   S3   bucket   that   has   the   following   two  tags:
                  {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

              The query would not include the following items in the  results,
              however.

                 o An   EC2   instance   that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                   {"Stage":"Deploy"} . The instance does not have all of  the
                   tag  keys  specified  in the filter, so it is excluded from
                   the results.

                 o An  RDS  database  that  has  the   following   two   tags:
                   {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database has
                   all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an  associ-
                   ated  value that matches at least one of the specified val-
                   ues in the filter.

          Query -> (string)
              The query that defines a group or a search.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Query=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0"|"CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
            "Query": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To update the query for a tag-based resource group

       The following update-group-query example updates the query attached  to
       the specified tag-based resource group.

          aws resource-groups update-group-query \
              --group-name tbq-WebServer \
              --resource-query '{"Type":"TAG_FILTERS_1_0", "Query":"{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"}'

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-east-2:123456789012:group/tbq-WebServer",
                  "Name": "tbq-WebServer"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "TAG_FILTERS_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::EC2::Instance\"],\"TagFilters\":[{\"Key\":\"Name\", \"Values\":[\"WebServers\"]}]}"
              }
          }

       Guide.

       Example 2: To update the query for  a  CloudFormation  stack-based  re-
       source group

       The  following update-group-query example updates the query attached to
       the specified AWS CloudFormation stack-based resource group.

          aws resource-groups update-group-query \
              --group-name cbq-CFNstackgroup \
              --resource-query '{"Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0", "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"}'

       Output:

          {
              "Group": {
                  "GroupArn": "arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:123456789012:group/cbq-CFNstackgroup",
                  "Name": "cbq-CFNstackgroup"
              },
              "ResourceQuery": {
                  "Type": "CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0",
                  "Query": "{\"ResourceTypeFilters\":[\"AWS::AllSupported\"],\"StackIdentifier\":\"arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/MyCFNStack/1415z9z0-z39z-11z8-97z5-500z212zz6fz\"}"
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       GroupQuery -> (structure)
          The  updated resource query associated with the resource group after
          the update.

          GroupName -> (string)
              The name of the resource group that is associated with the spec-
              ified resource query.

          ResourceQuery -> (structure)
              The  resource query that determines which AWS resources are mem-
              bers of the associated resource group.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of the query. You can use the following values:

                 o

                   *
                   CLOUDFORMATION_STACK_1_0: * Specifies that the  Query  con-
                   tains an ARN for a CloudFormation stack.

                 System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 272)
                   Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.

                 o ``TAG_FILTERS_1_0:`` * Specifies that the ``Query`` parame-
                   ter contains a JSON string that represents a collection  of
                   simple  tag  filters  for resource types and tags. The JSON
                   string uses  a  syntax  similar  to  the  ``  `GetResources
                   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-
                   est/APIReference/API_GetResources.html>`__  ``   operation,
                   but     uses     only     the    ``    `ResourceTypeFilters
                   <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstagging/lat-

                   ging-GetResources-request-ResourceTypeFilters>`__ `` and ``
                   `TagFilters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resourcegroupstag-
                   ging/latest/APIReference/API_GetResources.html#resource-

                   `` fields. If you specify more than one tag key,  only  re-
                   sources  that match all tag keys, and at least one value of
                   each specified tag key, are returned in your query. If  you
                   specify  more  than  one  value  for  a tag key, a resource
                   matches the filter if it has a tag key value  that  matches
                   *any  of  the  specified  values. For example, consider the
                   following sample query for resources that  have  two  tags,
                   Stage    and    Version    ,    with   two   values   each:
                   [{"Stage":["Test","Deploy"]},{"Version":["1","2"]}]     The
                   results of this query could include the following.

                   o An   EC2  instance  that  has  the  following  two  tags:
                     {"Stage":"Deploy"} , and {"Version":"2"}

                   o An  S3  bucket  that  has   the   following   two   tags:
                     {"Stage":"Test"} , and {"Version":"1"}

                 The  query  would  not include the following items in the re-
                 sults, however.

                     o An EC2  instance  that  has  only  the  following  tag:
                       {"Stage":"Deploy"}  . The instance does not have all of
                       the tag keys specified in the filter, so it is excluded
                       from the results.

                     o An  RDS  database  that  has  the  following  two tags:
                       {"Stage":"Archived"} and {"Version":"4"}   The database
                       has  all of the tag keys, but none of those keys has an
                       associated value that matches at least one of the spec-
                       ified values in the filter.

              Query -> (string)
                 The query that defines a group or a search.
