UPDATE-PIPELINE-STATUS()                              UPDATE-PIPELINE-STATUS()



NAME
       update-pipeline-status -

DESCRIPTION
       The UpdatePipelineStatus operation pauses or reactivates a pipeline, so
       that the pipeline stops or restarts the processing of jobs.

       Changing the pipeline status is useful if you want  to  cancel  one  or
       more  jobs.  You can't cancel jobs after Elastic Transcoder has started
       processing them; if you pause the pipeline to which you  submitted  the
       jobs,  you have more time to get the job IDs for the jobs that you want
       to cancel, and to send a  CancelJob request.

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The identifier of the pipeline to update.

       --status (string)
          The desired status of the pipeline:

          o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

          o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Pipeline -> (structure)
          A  section  of the response body that provides information about the
          pipeline.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier for the pipeline. You use this value to  identify
              the  pipeline  in  which you want to perform a variety of opera-
              tions, such as creating a job or a preset.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the pipeline.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the pipeline. We recommend that the name  be  unique
              within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced.

              Constraints: Maximum 40 characters

          Status -> (string)
              The current status of the pipeline:

              o Active : The pipeline is processing jobs.

              o Paused : The pipeline is not currently processing jobs.

          InputBucket -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets media
              files for transcoding and the graphics files, if any,  that  you
              want to use for watermarks.

          OutputBucket -> (string)
              The  Amazon  S3  bucket  in which you want Elastic Transcoder to
              save transcoded files, thumbnails,  and  playlists.  Either  you
              specify this value, or you specify both ContentConfig and Thumb-
              nailConfig .

          Role -> (string)
              The IAM Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for  the  role  that  Elastic
              Transcoder uses to transcode jobs for this pipeline.

              If you use either s3 or s3-aws-kms as your Encryption:Mode , you
              don't need to provide a key with your job because a default key,
              known as an AWS-KMS key, is created for you  automatically.  You
              need to provide an AWS-KMS key only if you want to use a non-de-
              fault AWS-KMS key, or if you are  using  an  Encryption:Mode  of
              aes-cbc-pkcs7 , aes-ctr , or aes-gcm .

                bucket.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder  to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and
                   playlists (if any) together in one bucket.

                 o You do not want to specify the users or groups who have ac-
                   cess to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists.

                 o You do not want to specify  the  permissions  that  Elastic
                   Transcoder grants to the files.

                   with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                 If you want to save transcoded files  and  playlists  in  one
                 bucket  and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users
                 can access the transcoded files or the permissions the  users
                 have,  or  change  the  Amazon S3 storage class, omit Output-
                 Bucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailCon-
                 fig instead.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy ,
                 that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files
                 and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.

              Permissions -> (list)
                 Optional. The Permissions object specifies which users and/or
                 predefined Amazon S3  groups  you  want  to  have  access  to
                 transcoded  files  and  playlists, and the type of access you
                 want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum  of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If  you  include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions  to the owner of the role specified by Role . If you
                 want that user to have  full  control,  you  must  explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner  of
                 the  role specified by Role , and grants no other permissions
                 to any other user or group.

                          CloudFront distribution.

                        WARNING:
                            A canonical user ID is not the same as an AWS  ac-

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The Amazon S3 bucket in which you want Elastic Transcoder  to
                 save the transcoded files. Specify this value when all of the
                 following are true:

                 o You want to save transcoded files, thumbnails (if any), and
                   playlists (if any) together in one bucket.

                 o You do not want to specify the users or groups who have ac-
                   cess to the transcoded files, thumbnails, and playlists.

                 o You do not want to specify  the  permissions  that  Elastic
                   Transcoder grants to the files.

                 o You  want  to associate the transcoded files and thumbnails
                   with the Amazon S3 Standard storage class.

                 If you want to save transcoded files  and  playlists  in  one
                 bucket  and thumbnails in another bucket, specify which users
                 can access the transcoded files or the permissions the  users
                 have,  or  change  the  Amazon S3 storage class, omit Output-
                 Bucket and specify values for ContentConfig and ThumbnailCon-
                 fig instead.

              StorageClass -> (string)
                 The  Amazon S3 storage class, Standard or ReducedRedundancy ,
                 that you want Elastic Transcoder to assign to the video files
                 and playlists that it stores in your Amazon S3 bucket.

              Permissions -> (list)
                 Optional. The Permissions object specifies which users and/or
                 predefined Amazon S3  groups  you  want  to  have  access  to
                 transcoded  files  and  playlists, and the type of access you
                 want them to have. You can grant permissions to a maximum  of
                 30 users and/or predefined Amazon S3 groups.

                 If  you  include Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants only
                 the permissions that you specify. It does not grant full per-
                 missions  to the owner of the role specified by Role . If you
                 want that user to have  full  control,  you  must  explicitly
                 grant full control to the user.

                 If you omit Permissions , Elastic Transcoder grants full con-
                 trol over the transcoded files and playlists to the owner  of
                 the  role specified by Role , and grants no other permissions
                 to any other user or group.
