CREATE-PRESET()                                                CREATE-PRESET()



NAME
       create-preset -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreatePreset  operation  creates  a  preset with settings that you
       specify.

       WARNING:
          Elastic Transcoder checks the CreatePreset settings to  ensure  that
          they  meet  Elastic Transcoder requirements and to determine whether
          they comply with H.264 standards. If your settings are not valid for
          Elastic  Transcoder, Elastic Transcoder returns an HTTP 400 response
          (ValidationException ) and does not create the preset. If  the  set-
          tings are valid for Elastic Transcoder but aren't strictly compliant
          with the H.264 standard, Elastic Transcoder creates the  preset  and
          returns  a warning message in the response. This helps you determine
          whether your settings comply with the H.264  standard  while  giving
          you  greater  flexibility  with  respect  to  the video that Elastic
          Transcoder produces.

       Elastic Transcoder uses the H.264 video-compression  format.  For  more
       information,  see the International Telecommunication Union publication
       Recommendation ITU-T H.264: Advanced video coding for generic  audiovi-
       sual services .

          CodecOptions -> (map)
                 Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)

              The  H.264  profile  that  you  want to use for the output file.
              Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

              o baseline : The profile most commonly used for  videoconferenc-
                ing and for mobile applications.

              o main  :  The  profile  used for standard-definition digital TV
                broadcasts.

              o high : The profile used for high-definition digital TV  broad-
                casts and for Blu-ray discs.
                 Level (H.264 Only)

              The  H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elas-
              tic Transcoder supports the following levels:
                 1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 , 3.2 ,  4
                 , 4.1

                 MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)

              Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The max-
              imum number of previously decoded frames to use as  a  reference
              for  decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through
              16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater  than  the
              following:
                 Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256
                 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)

              where Width in pixels and  Height  in  pixels  represent  either
              MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture
              buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level  object.
              See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring
              16x16.)

              o 1 - 396

              o 1b - 396

              o 1.1 - 900

              o 1.2 - 2376

              o 1.3 - 2376

              o 2 - 2376

              o 2.1 - 4752

              o 2.2 - 8100

              o 3 - 8100

              o 3.1 - 18000

              o 3.2 - 20480

              o 4 - 32768

              o 4.1 - 32768
                 MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

              The maximum number of bits per second in  a  video  buffer;  the
              size  of the buffer is specified by BufferSize . Specify a value
              between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required  to
              stream  a  video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also
              reduces the quality of the video.
                 BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

              The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video.
              This  window  is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment dura-
              tion when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of
              the  output  video.  Specify  an  integer greater than 0. If you
              specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elastic Transcoder sets
              BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate .
                 InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

              The interlace mode for the output video.

              Interlaced  video is used to double the perceived frame rate for
              a video by interlacing two fields  (one  field  on  every  other
              line,  the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye
              registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing  reduces  the
              bandwidth  required  for transmitting a video, but can result in
              blurred images and flickering.

              Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing,  top  to  bot-
              tom),  TopFirst  (top  field  first),  BottomFirst (bottom field
              first), and Auto .

              If InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses  Pro-
              gressive   for   the  output.  If  Auto  is  specified,  Elastic
              Transcoder interlaces the output.
                 ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

              The color space conversion Elastic  Transcoder  applies  to  the
              output  video.  Color spaces are the algorithms used by the com-
              puter to store information about how to render color. Bt.601  is
              the  standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the
              standard for high definition video.

              Valid values include None , Bt709toBt601 ,  Bt601toBt709  ,  and
              Auto .

              If  you  chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output
              is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97
              ,  50  , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using
              one of the resolution  changes  from  the  list  below,  Elastic
              Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:

              o Standard  to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder ap-
                plies Bt601ToBt709

              o Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder  ap-
                plies Bt601ToBt709

              o HD  to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder ap-
                plies Bt709ToBt601

              o HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder  ap-
                plies Bt709ToBt601

              NOTE:
                 Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the Colorspace-
                 ConversionMode  Auto mode in the future.  All  outputs  in  a
                 playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode .

              If  you  do  not  specify  a  ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic
              Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are
              unsure  what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output
              file, you can check  the  AppliedColorSpaceConversion  parameter
              included  in your job response. If your job does not have an Ap-
              pliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no  ColorSpaceConver-
              sionMode was applied.
                 ChromaSubsampling

              The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the out-
              put video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .
                 yuv420p samples the chroma information of every  other  hori-
                 zontal  and  every  other  vertical line, yuv422p samples the
                 color information of every horizontal line  and  every  other
                 vertical line.

                 LoopCount (Gif Only)

              The  number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid val-
              ues include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , inclusive.

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          KeyframesMaxDist -> (string)
              Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264  ,
              MPEG2 , or VP8 .

              The  maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are
              fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are  encoded
              based,  in  part, on the content of the key frames. The value is
              an integer formatted as a string; valid  values  are  between  1
              (every  frame  is  a  key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher
              value results in higher compression but may also discernibly de-
              crease video quality.

              For  Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to
              the KeyframesMaxDist . This allows Smooth  playlists  to  switch
              between different quality levels while the file is being played.

              For  example,  an  input  file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a
              KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ra-
              tio  of  1:3.  Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and
              10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.

              Alternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate  to  auto
              and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist
              .

          FixedGOP -> (string)
              Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264  ,
              MPEG2 , or VP8 .

              Whether  to  use  a  fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values are
              true and false :

              o true : Elastic Transcoder uses the value  of  KeyframesMaxDist
                for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a
                group of pictures, or GOP).

              o false : The distance between key frames can vary.

              WARNING:
                 FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.

          BitRate -> (string)
              The bit rate of the video stream in the output  file,  in  kilo-
              bits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Pro-
              file . If you specify auto , Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the  de-
              tected  bit  rate  of  the  input source. If you specify a value
              other than auto , we recommend that you  specify  a  value  less
              than  or  equal  to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for
              your level and profile:
                 Level - Maximum video bit rate in  kilobits/second  (baseline
                 and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second
                 (high Profile)

              o 1 - 64 : 80

              o 1b - 128 : 160

              o 1.1 - 192 : 240

              o 1.2 - 384 : 480

              o 1.3 - 768 : 960

              o 2 - 2000 : 2500

              o 3 - 10000 : 12500

              o 3.1 - 14000 : 17500

              o 3.2 - 20000 : 25000

              o 4 - 20000 : 25000

              o 4.1 - 50000 : 62500

          FrameRate -> (string)
              The frames per second for the video stream in the  output  file.
              Valid values include:
                 auto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

              If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame
              rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recom-
              mend that you perform the following calculation:
                 Frame  rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma sam-
                 ples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)

              where:

              o width in pixels and height in pixels represent the  Resolution
                of the output video.

              o maximum  recommended  decoding speed in Luma samples/second is
                less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the  follow-
                ing table, based on the value that you specified for Level.

              The  maximum  recommended  decoding speed in Luma samples/second
              for each level is described in the following list (Level  -  De-
              coding speed ):

              o 1 - 380160

              o 1b - 380160

              o 1.1 - 76800

              o 1.2 - 1536000

              o 1.3 - 3041280

              o 2 - 3041280

              o 2.1 - 5068800

              o 2.2 - 5184000

              o 3 - 10368000

              o 3.1 - 27648000

              o 3.2 - 55296000

              o 4 - 62914560

              o 4.1 - 62914560

          MaxFrameRate -> (string)
              If  you specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses the
              frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of  the  output
              video.  Specify  the  maximum  frame  rate that you want Elastic
              Transcoder to use when the frame rate  of  the  input  video  is
              greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video.
              Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 ,  30  ,
              60 .

          Resolution -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 To  better  control  resolution  and  aspect  ratio of output
                 videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth ,  Max-
                 Height  , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRa-
                 tio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of
                 settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

              The width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels.
              Valid values are auto and width x height :

              o auto : Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the  width  and
                height of the input file, subject to the following rules.

              o

                ``
                width  x  height `` : The width and height of the output video
                in pixels.

              Note the following about specifying the width and height:

              o The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclu-
                sive.

              o The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclu-
                sive.

              o If you specify a resolution that is less than  the  resolution
                of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file
                to the lower resolution.

              o If you specify a resolution that is greater than  the  resolu-
                tion of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output
                to the higher resolution.

              o We recommend that you specify a resolution for which the prod-
                uct  of width and height is less than or equal to the applica-
                ble value in the following list (List -  Max  width  x  height
                value ):

          AspectRatio -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 To  better  control  resolution  and  aspect  ratio of output
                 videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth ,  Max-
                 Height  , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRa-
                 tio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of
                 settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

              The  display aspect ratio of the video in the output file. Valid
              values include:
                 auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

              If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to  preserve  the
              aspect ratio of the input file.

              If  you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that differs
              from aspect ratio of the input  file,  Elastic  Transcoder  adds
              pillarboxing  (black  bars  on the sides) or letterboxing (black
              bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of  the
              active region of the video.

          MaxWidth -> (string)
              The  maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you specify
              auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full  HD)  as  the  default
              value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer be-
              tween 128 and 4096.

          MaxHeight -> (string)
              The maximum height of the output video in pixels. If you specify
              auto  ,  Elastic  Transcoder  uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default
              value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer be-
              tween 96 and 3072.

          DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
              The  value  that  Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in the
              output file.

          SizingPolicy -> (string)
              Specify one of the following values to control  scaling  of  the
              output video:

              o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales the output video so it matches
                the value that you specified in either MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight
                without exceeding the other value.

              o Fill  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the  output  video so it
                matches the value that you specified  in  either  MaxWidth  or
                MaxHeight  and  matches  or  exceeds  the other value. Elastic
                Transcoder centers the output video and then crops it  in  the
                dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

              o Stretch  :  Elastic  Transcoder  stretches the output video to
                match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight
                .  If the relative proportions of the input video and the out-
                put video are different, the output video will be distorted.

              o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output video.  If
                either  dimension  of  the input video exceeds the values that
                you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight , Elastic  Transcoder
                crops the output video.

              o ShrinkToFit  : Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down
                so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for
                at  least  one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding ei-
                ther value. If you specify  this  option,  Elastic  Transcoder
                does not scale the video up.

              o ShrinkToFill : Elastic Transcoder scales the output video down
                so that its dimensions match the values that you specified for
                at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below
                either value. If you specify this option,  Elastic  Transcoder
                does not scale the video up.

          PaddingPolicy -> (string)
              When  you  set PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder may add
              black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides  of
              the  output  video  to  make  the total size of the output video
              match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

          Watermarks -> (list)
              Settings for the size, location, and opacity  of  graphics  that
              you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  overlay over videos that are
              transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings for up to
              four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the specified size and lo-
              cation, and with the specified opacity for the duration  of  the
              transcoded video.

              Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display
              a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format,  which
              supports transparency.

              When  you  create  a  job that uses this preset, you specify the
              .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic  Transcoder  to  in-
              clude  in  the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer graphics
              in the job than you specify watermark settings  in  the  preset,
              which  allows  you  to use the same preset for up to four water-
              marks that have different dimensions.

              (structure)
                 Settings for the size, location, and opacity of graphics that
                 you  want  Elastic Transcoder to overlay over videos that are
                 transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings for up
                 to  four  watermarks. Watermarks appear in the specified size
                 and location, and with the specified opacity for the duration
                 of the transcoded video.

                 Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to dis-
                 play a watermark that is not rectangular, use the  .png  for-
                 mat, which supports transparency.

                 When  you create a job that uses this preset, you specify the
                 .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to in-
                 clude  in the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer graph-
                 ics in the job than you specify  watermark  settings  in  the
                 preset,  which  allows  you  to use the same preset for up to
                 four watermarks that have different dimensions.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A unique identifier for the settings for  one  watermark.
                     The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.

                 MaxWidth -> (string)
                     The  maximum width of the watermark in one of the follow-
                     ing formats:

                     o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16  pixels,
                       and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth .

                     o integer  percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0
                       to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether  you
                       want  Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars that
                       are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the  calcu-
                       lation.  If you specify the value in pixels, it must be
                       less than or equal to the value of MaxWidth .

                 MaxHeight -> (string)
                     The maximum height of the watermark in one of the follow-
                     ing formats:

                     o number  of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16 pixels,
                       and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight .

                     o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is  0
                       to  100. Use the value of Target to specify whether you
                       want Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars  that
                       are  added by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the calcu-
                       lation.

                     If you specify the value in pixels, it must be less  than
                     or equal to the value of MaxHeight .

                 SizingPolicy -> (string)
                     A value that controls scaling of the watermark:

                     o Fit  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales the watermark so it
                       matches the value that you specified in either MaxWidth
                       or MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.

                     o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the watermark to
                       match the values that you specified  for  MaxWidth  and
                       MaxHeight  .  If the relative proportions of the water-
                       mark and the values of MaxWidth and MaxHeight are  dif-
                       ferent, the watermark will be distorted.

                     o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark
                       down so that its dimensions match the values  that  you
                       specified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight
                       without exceeding either value. If you specify this op-
                       tion,  Elastic  Transcoder does not scale the watermark
                       up.

                 HorizontalAlign -> (string)
                     The horizontal position of the watermark unless you spec-
                     ify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset :

                     o Left  :  The left edge of the watermark is aligned with
                       the left border of the video.

                     o Right : The right edge of the watermark is aligned with
                       the right border of the video.

                     o Center : The watermark is centered between the left and
                       right borders.

                 HorizontalOffset -> (string)
                     The amount by which you want the horizontal  position  of
                     the watermark to be offset from the position specified by
                     HorizontalAlign:

                     o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is  0  pixels,
                       and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth.

                     o integer  percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0
                       to 100.

                     For example, if you specify Left for HorizontalAlign  and
                     5px for HorizontalOffset , the left side of the watermark
                     appears 5 pixels from  the  left  border  of  the  output
                     video.
                        HorizontalOffset is only valid when the value of Hori-
                        zontalAlign is Left or Right . If you specify an  off-
                        set  that  causes  the  watermark to extend beyond the
                        left or right border and Elastic  Transcoder  has  not
                        added black bars, the watermark is cropped. If Elastic
                        Transcoder has added black bars, the watermark extends
                        into  the  black bars. If the watermark extends beyond
                        the black bars, it is cropped.

                     Use the value of Target to specify whether  you  want  to
                     include   the  black  bars  that  are  added  by  Elastic
                     Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.

                 VerticalAlign -> (string)
                     The vertical position of the watermark unless you specify
                     a non-zero value for VerticalOffset :

                     o Top : The top edge of the watermark is aligned with the
                       top border of the video.

                     o Bottom : The bottom edge of the  watermark  is  aligned
                       with the bottom border of the video.

                     o Center  : The watermark is centered between the top and
                       bottom borders.

                 VerticalOffset -> (string)
                        VerticalOffset

                     The amount by which you want the vertical position of the
                     watermark  to  be  offset  from the position specified by
                     VerticalAlign:

                     o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is  0  pixels,
                       and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight .

                     o integer  percentage (%): The range of valid values is 0
                       to 100.

                     For example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign and 5px
                     for  VerticalOffset  , the top of the watermark appears 5
                     pixels from the top border of the output video.
                        VerticalOffset is only valid when the value of  Verti-
                        calAlign is Top or Bottom.

                     If you specify an offset that causes the watermark to ex-
                     tend  beyond  the  top  or  bottom  border  and   Elastic
                     Transcoder  has  not  added  black bars, the watermark is
                     cropped. If Elastic Transcoder has added black bars,  the
                     watermark  extends  into the black bars. If the watermark
                     extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped.

                     Use the value of Target to specify whether you want Elas-
                     tic  Transcoder  to include the black bars that are added
                     by Elastic Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.

                 Opacity -> (string)
                     A percentage that indicates how much you want a watermark
                     to  obscure  the  video in the location where it appears.
                     Valid values are 0 (the watermark is  invisible)  to  100
                     (the watermark completely obscures the video in the spec-
                     ified location). The datatype of Opacity is float.

                     Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics. If
                     you  use  a  transparent .png, the transparent portion of
                     the video appears as if you had specified a  value  of  0
                     for Opacity . The .jpg file format doesn't support trans-
                     parency.

                 Target -> (string)
                     A value that determines how Elastic Transcoder interprets
                     values  that  you  specified  for HorizontalOffset , Ver-
                     ticalOffset , MaxWidth , and MaxHeight :

                     o Content : HorizontalOffset  and  VerticalOffset  values
                       are  calculated  based  on the borders of the video ex-
                       cluding black bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if any.
                       In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if specified as a
                       percentage, are calculated based on the borders of  the
                       video excluding black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
                       if any.

                     o Frame : HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values  are
                       calculated  based on the borders of the video including
                       black bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if any. In  ad-
                       dition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if specified as a per-
                       centage, are calculated based on  the  borders  of  the
                       video including black bars added by Elastic Transcoder,
                       if any.

          Codec -> (string)
              The audio codec for the output file. Valid values include aac  ,
              flac , mp2 , mp3 , pcm , and vorbis .

          SampleRate -> (string)
              The  sample  rate  of  the  audio  stream in the output file, in
              Hertz. Valid values include:
                 auto , 22050 , 32000 , 44100 , 48000 , 96000

              If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  automatically  detects
              the sample rate.

          BitRate -> (string)
              The  bit  rate  of the audio stream in the output file, in kilo-
              bits/second. Enter an integer between 64 and 320, inclusive.

          Channels -> (string)
              The number of audio channels in the output file.  The  following
              values are valid:
                 auto , 0 , 1 , 2

              One  channel carries the information played by a single speaker.
              For example, a stereo track with two channels sends one  channel
              to the left speaker, and the other channel to the right speaker.
              The output channels are organized into tracks. If you want Elas-
              tic Transcoder to automatically detect the number of audio chan-
              nels in the input file and use that value for the  output  file,
              select auto .

              The  output  of  a specific channel value and inputs are as fol-
              lows:

              o auto  channel specified, with any input: Pass  through  up  to
                eight input channels.

              o 0   channels specified, with any input: Audio omitted from the
                output.

              o 1  channel specified, with at least one  input  channel:  Mono
                sound.

              o 2   channels  specified,  with  any  input: Two identical mono
                channels or stereo. For more information about tracks, see Au-
                dio:AudioPackingMode.

              For  more  information  about  how  Elastic Transcoder organizes
              channels and tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode .

          AudioPackingMode -> (string)
              The method of organizing audio  channels  and  tracks.  Use  Au-
              dio:Channels  to  specify the number of channels in your output,
              and Audio:AudioPackingMode to specify the number of  tracks  and
              their  relation  to  the  channels. If you do not specify an Au-
              dio:AudioPackingMode , Elastic Transcoder uses SingleTrack .

              The following values are valid:
                 SingleTrack , OneChannelPerTrack  ,  and  OneChannelPerTrack-
                 WithMosTo8Tracks

              When you specify SingleTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates a sin-
              gle track for your output. The track can have up to eight  chan-
              nels. Use SingleTrack for all non-mxf containers.

              The  outputs of SingleTrack for a specific channel value and in-
              puts are as follows:

              o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

              o 1, 2, or auto  channels with no  audio  input:  Audio  omitted
                from the output

              o 1  channel with any input with audio: One track with one chan-
                nel, downmixed if necessary

              o 2  channels with one track with one channel:  One  track  with
                two identical channels

              o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each: One
                track with two channels

              o 2 or auto  channels with one  track  with  two  channels:  One
                track with two channels

              o 2   channels  with one track with multiple channels: One track
                with two channels

              o auto  channels with one track with one channel: One track with
                one channel

              o auto   channels  with  one  track  with multiple channels: One
                track with multiple channels

              When you specify OneChannelPerTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates
              a  new  track  for every channel in your output. Your output can
              have up to eight single-channel tracks.

              The outputs of OneChannelPerTrack for a specific  channel  value
              and inputs are as follows:

              o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

              o 1,  2,  or  auto   channels with no audio input: Audio omitted
                from the output

              o 1  channel with any input with audio: One track with one chan-
                nel, downmixed if necessary

              o 2   channels  with one track with one channel: Two tracks with
                one identical channel each

              o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each: Two
                tracks with one channel each

              o 2  or  auto   channels  with  one track with two channels: Two
                tracks with one channel each

              o 2  channels with one track with multiple channels: Two  tracks
                with one channel each

              o auto  channels with one track with one channel: One track with
                one channel

              o auto  channels with one track with multiple  channels:  Up  to
                eight tracks with one channel each

              When  you  specify  OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks , Elastic
              Transcoder creates eight single-channel tracks for your  output.
              All  tracks that do not contain audio data from an input channel
              are MOS, or Mit Out Sound, tracks.

              The outputs of OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks for a specific
              channel value and inputs are as follows:

              o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

              o 1,  2,  or  auto   channels with no audio input: Audio omitted
                from the output

              o 1  channel with any input with audio: One track with one chan-
                nel, downmixed if necessary, plus six MOS tracks

              o 2   channels  with one track with one channel: Two tracks with
                one identical channel each, plus six MOS tracks

              o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each: Two
                tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

              o 2  or  auto   channels  with  one track with two channels: Two
                tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

              o 2  channels with one track with multiple channels: Two  tracks
                with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

              o auto  channels with one track with one channel: One track with
                one channel, plus seven MOS tracks

              o auto  channels with one track with multiple  channels:  Up  to
                eight  tracks  with  one  channel  each, plus MOS tracks until
                there are eight tracks in all

          CodecOptions -> (structure)
              If you specified AAC for Audio:Codec , this is the AAC  compres-
              sion profile to use. Valid values include:
                 auto , AAC-LC , HE-AAC , HE-AACv2

              If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder chooses a profile based
              on the bit rate of the output file.

              Profile -> (string)
                 You can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC for
                 the value of Audio:Codec.

                 Specify   the  AAC  profile  for  the  output  file.  Elastic
                 Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                 o auto : If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder selects the
                   profile based on the bit rate selected for the output file.

                 o AAC-LC  :  The  most  common AAC profile. Use for bit rates
                   larger than 64 kbps.

                 o HE-AAC : Not supported on some older players  and  devices.
                   Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.

                 o HE-AACv2  :  Not supported on some players and devices. Use
                   for bit rates less than 48 kbps.

                 All outputs in a Smooth playlist must have the same value for
                 Profile .

                 NOTE:
                     If  you  created  any  presets  before  AAC profiles were
                     added, Elastic Transcoder automatically updated your pre-
                     sets to use AAC-LC. You can change the value as required.

              BitDepth -> (string)
                 You  can only choose an audio bit depth when you specify flac
                 or pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                 The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information are
                 included  in the audio samples. The higher the bit depth, the
                 better the audio, but the larger the file.

                 Valid values are 16 and 24 .

                 The most common bit depth is 24 .

              BitOrder -> (string)
                 You can only choose an audio bit order when you  specify  pcm
                 for the value of Audio:Codec.

                 The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.

                 The supported value is LittleEndian .

              Signed -> (string)
                 You  can  only  choose whether an audio sample is signed when
                 you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                 Whether audio samples are represented with negative and posi-
                 tive numbers (signed) or only positive numbers (unsigned).

                 The supported value is Signed .

       --thumbnails (structure)
          A  section  of the request body that specifies the thumbnail parame-
          ters, if any.

          Format -> (string)
              The format of thumbnails, if any. Valid values are jpg and png .

              You specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumb-
              nails when you create a job.

          Interval -> (string)
              The approximate number of seconds between thumbnails. Specify an
              integer value.

          Resolution -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 To better control resolution and aspect ratio of  thumbnails,
                 we  recommend  that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight ,
                 SizingPolicy , and PaddingPolicy instead  of  Resolution  and
                 AspectRatio  . The two groups of settings are mutually exclu-
                 sive. Do not use them together.

              The width and height of thumbnail files  in  pixels.  Specify  a
              value in the format `` width `` x `` height `` where both values
              are even integers. The values cannot exceed the width and height
              that you specified in the Video:Resolution object.

          AspectRatio -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 To  better control resolution and aspect ratio of thumbnails,
                 we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth ,  MaxHeight  ,
                 SizingPolicy  ,  and  PaddingPolicy instead of Resolution and
                 AspectRatio . The two groups of settings are mutually  exclu-
                 sive. Do not use them together.

              The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include:
                 auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

              If  you  specify auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the
              aspect ratio of the video in the output file.

          MaxWidth -> (string)
              The maximum width of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify  auto,
              Elastic  Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If
              you specify a numeric value, enter an even  integer  between  32
              and 4096.

          MaxHeight -> (string)
              The maximum height of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify auto,
              Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value.  If
              you  specify  a  numeric value, enter an even integer between 32
              and 3072.

          SizingPolicy -> (string)
              Specify one of the following values to control scaling of thumb-
              nails:

              o Fit  :  Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the
                value that you specified in thumbnail  MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight
                settings without exceeding the other value.

              o Fill  : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the
                value that you specified in thumbnail  MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight
                settings  and  matches  or  exceeds  the  other value. Elastic
                Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then  crops  in
                the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

              o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match the
                values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight
                settings.  If  the relative proportions of the input video and
                thumbnails are different, the thumbnails will be distorted.

              o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If either
                dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you spec-
                ified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight  settings,  Elastic
                Transcoder crops the thumbnails.

              o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic  Transcoder  scales thumbnails down so
                that their dimensions match the values that you specified  for
                at  least  one of thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight without ex-
                ceeding either value. If  you  specify  this  option,  Elastic
                Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

              o ShrinkToFill  :  Elastic  Transcoder scales thumbnails down so
                that their dimensions match the values that you specified  for
                at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below
                either value. If you specify this option,  Elastic  Transcoder
                does not scale thumbnails up.

          PaddingPolicy -> (string)
              When  you  set PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder may add
              black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides  of
              thumbnails  to  make  the total size of the thumbnails match the
              values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight
              settings.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

OUTPUT
       Preset -> (structure)
          A section of the response body that provides information  about  the
          preset that is created.

          Id -> (string)
              Identifier  for  the  new preset. You use this value to get set-
              tings for the preset or to delete it.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the preset.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the preset.

          Description -> (string)
              A description of the preset.

          Container -> (string)
              The container type for the output  file.  Valid  values  include
              flac , flv , fmp4 , gif , mp3 , mp4 , mpg , mxf , oga , ogg , ts
              , and webm .

          Audio -> (structure)
              A section of the response body that provides  information  about
              the audio preset values.

              Codec -> (string)
                 The audio codec for the output file. Valid values include aac
                 , flac , mp2 , mp3 , pcm , and vorbis .

              SampleRate -> (string)
                 The sample rate of the audio stream in the  output  file,  in
                 Hertz. Valid values include:
                     auto , 22050 , 32000 , 44100 , 48000 , 96000

                 If  you  specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder automatically de-
                 tects the sample rate.

              BitRate -> (string)
                 The bit rate of the audio stream in the output file, in kilo-
                 bits/second. Enter an integer between 64 and 320, inclusive.

              Channels -> (string)
                 The  number of audio channels in the output file. The follow-
                 ing values are valid:
                     auto , 0 , 1 , 2

                 One channel  carries  the  information  played  by  a  single
                 speaker.  For example, a stereo track with two channels sends
                 one channel to the left speaker, and the other channel to the
                 right speaker. The output channels are organized into tracks.
                 If you want Elastic Transcoder to  automatically  detect  the
                 number of audio channels in the input file and use that value
                 for the output file, select auto .

                 The output of a specific channel value and inputs are as fol-
                 lows:

                 o auto  channel specified, with any input: Pass through up to
                   eight input channels.

                 o 0  channels specified, with any input: Audio  omitted  from
                   the output.

                 o 1  channel specified, with at least one input channel: Mono
                   sound.

                 o 2  channels specified, with any input: Two  identical  mono
                   channels  or stereo. For more information about tracks, see
                   Audio:AudioPackingMode.

                 For more information about how Elastic  Transcoder  organizes
                 channels and tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode .

              AudioPackingMode -> (string)
                 The  method  of organizing audio channels and tracks. Use Au-
                 dio:Channels to specify the number of channels in  your  out-
                 put,  and  Audio:AudioPackingMode  to  specify  the number of
                 tracks and their relation to the  channels.  If  you  do  not
                 specify  an  Audio:AudioPackingMode , Elastic Transcoder uses
                 SingleTrack .

                 The following values are valid:
                     SingleTrack ,  OneChannelPerTrack  ,  and  OneChannelPer-
                     TrackWithMosTo8Tracks

                 When  you  specify SingleTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates a
                 single track for your output. The track can have up to  eight
                 channels. Use SingleTrack for all non-mxf containers.

                 The  outputs  of SingleTrack for a specific channel value and
                 inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1, 2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio  omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1   channel  with  any input with audio: One track with one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary

                 o 2  channels with one track with one channel: One track with
                   two identical channels

                 o 2  or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel each:
                   One track with two channels

                 o 2 or auto  channels with one track with two  channels:  One
                   track with two channels

                 o 2   channels  with  one  track  with multiple channels: One
                   track with two channels

                 o auto  channels with one track with one channel:  One  track
                   with one channel

                 o auto   channels  with one track with multiple channels: One
                   track with multiple channels

                 When you specify OneChannelPerTrack , Elastic Transcoder cre-
                 ates  a new track for every channel in your output. Your out-
                 put can have up to eight single-channel tracks.

                 The outputs of  OneChannelPerTrack  for  a  specific  channel
                 value and inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1,  2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1  channel with any input with audio: One  track  with  one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary

                 o 2   channels  with  one  track with one channel: Two tracks
                   with one identical channel each

                 o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel  each:
                   Two tracks with one channel each

                 o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels: Two
                   tracks with one channel each

                 o 2  channels with one  track  with  multiple  channels:  Two
                   tracks with one channel each

                 o auto   channels  with one track with one channel: One track
                   with one channel

                 o auto  channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to
                   eight tracks with one channel each

                 When you specify OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks , Elastic
                 Transcoder creates eight single-channel tracks for your  out-
                 put.  All tracks that do not contain audio data from an input
                 channel are MOS, or Mit Out Sound, tracks.

                 The outputs of OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks for a  spe-
                 cific channel value and inputs are as follows:

                 o 0  channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output

                 o 1,  2, or auto  channels with no audio input: Audio omitted
                   from the output

                 o 1  channel with any input with audio: One  track  with  one
                   channel, downmixed if necessary, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2   channels  with  one  track with one channel: Two tracks
                   with one identical channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2 or auto  channels with two tracks with one channel  each:
                   Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2  or  auto  channels with one track with two channels: Two
                   tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o 2  channels with one  track  with  multiple  channels:  Two
                   tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks

                 o auto   channels  with one track with one channel: One track
                   with one channel, plus seven MOS tracks

                 o auto  channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to
                   eight  tracks  with one channel each, plus MOS tracks until
                   there are eight tracks in all

              CodecOptions -> (structure)
                 If you specified AAC for Audio:Codec , this is the  AAC  com-
                 pression profile to use. Valid values include:
                     auto , AAC-LC , HE-AAC , HE-AACv2

                 If  you  specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder chooses a profile
                 based on the bit rate of the output file.

                 Profile -> (string)
                     You can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC
                     for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     Specify  the  AAC  profile  for  the output file. Elastic
                     Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                     o auto : If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder selects
                       the profile based on the bit rate selected for the out-
                       put file.

                     o AAC-LC : The most common AAC profile. Use for bit rates
                       larger than 64 kbps.

                     o HE-AAC  :  Not  supported on some older players and de-
                       vices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.

                     o HE-AACv2 : Not supported on some players  and  devices.
                       Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps.

                     All outputs in a Smooth playlist must have the same value
                     for Profile .

                     NOTE:
                        If you created any presets before  AAC  profiles  were
                        added,  Elastic  Transcoder automatically updated your
                        presets to use AAC-LC. You can change the value as re-
                        quired.

                 BitDepth -> (string)
                     You  can  only choose an audio bit depth when you specify
                     flac or pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     The bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information
                     are  included  in  the  audio samples. The higher the bit
                     depth, the better the audio, but the larger the file.

                     Valid values are 16 and 24 .

                     The most common bit depth is 24 .

                 BitOrder -> (string)
                     You can only choose an audio bit order when  you  specify
                     pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     The order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.

                     The supported value is LittleEndian .

                 Signed -> (string)
                     You  can  only  choose  whether an audio sample is signed
                     when you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.

                     Whether audio samples are represented with  negative  and
                     positive  numbers  (signed) or only positive numbers (un-
                     signed).

                     The supported value is Signed .

          Video -> (structure)
              A section of the response body that provides  information  about
              the video preset values.

              Codec -> (string)
                 The video codec for the output file. Valid values include gif
                 , H.264 , mpeg2 , vp8 , and vp9 . You can  only  specify  vp8
                 and  vp9  when the container type is webm , gif when the con-

                     Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)

                 The  H.264  profile that you want to use for the output file.
                 Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:

                 o baseline : The profile most commonly used for  videoconfer-
                   encing and for mobile applications.

                 o main  : The profile used for standard-definition digital TV
                   broadcasts.

                 o high : The profile  used  for  high-definition  digital  TV
                   broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.
                     Level (H.264 Only)

                 The  H.264  level  that  you want to use for the output file.
                 Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:
                     1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 ,  3.2
                     , 4 , 4.1

                     MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)

                 Applicable  only  when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The
                 maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a  ref-
                 erence  for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers
                 0 through 16, but we recommend  that  you  not  use  a  value
                 greater than the following:
                     Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks *
                     256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)

                 where Width in pixels and Height in pixels  represent  either
                 MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded pic-
                 ture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the  Level
                 object.  See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pix-
                 els measuring 16x16.)

                     MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                 The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer;  the
                 size  of  the  buffer  is specified by BufferSize . Specify a
                 value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth re-
                 quired  to  stream  a video by reducing the maximum bit rate,
                 but this also reduces the quality of the video.
                     BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)

                 The maximum number of bits in any x  seconds  of  the  output
                 video.  This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard seg-
                 ment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the  con-
                 tainer  type  of the output video. Specify an integer greater
                 than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elas-
                 tic  Transcoder  sets  BufferSize  to  10  times the value of
                 MaxBitRate .
                     InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                 The interlace mode for the output video.

                 Interlaced video is used to double the perceived  frame  rate
                 for  a  video  by  interlacing two fields (one field on every
                 other line, the other field on the other lines) so  that  the
                 human  eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing
                 reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video,  but
                 can result in blurred images and flickering.

                 Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bot-
                 tom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst  (bottom  field
                 first), and Auto .

                 If  InterlaceMode  is  not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses
                 Progressive for the output. If  Auto  is  specified,  Elastic
                 Transcoder interlaces the output.
                     ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)

                 The  color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the
                 output video. Color spaces are the  algorithms  used  by  the
                 computer  to  store  information  about  how to render color.
                 Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition  video,  while
                 Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.

                 Valid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and
                 Auto .

                 If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your  out-
                 put  is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25
                 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and  you
                 are  using one of the resolution changes from the list below,
                 Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space  conver-
                 sions:

                 o Standard  to  HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder
                   applies Bt601ToBt709

                 o Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 -  Elastic  Transcoder
                   applies Bt601ToBt709

                 o HD  to  Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder
                   applies Bt709ToBt601

                 o HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 -  Elastic  Transcoder
                   applies Bt709ToBt601

                 NOTE:
                     Elastic  Transcoder  may  change the behavior of the Col-
                     orspaceConversionMode  Auto mode in the future. All  out-
                     puts  in  a  playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConver-
                     sionMode .

                 If you do not specify a  ColorSpaceConversionMode  ,  Elastic
                 Transcoder  does not change the color space of a file. If you
                 are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to  your
                 output  file,  you  can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion
                 parameter included in your job response. If your job does not
                 have  an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no Col-
                 orSpaceConversionMode was applied.
                     ChromaSubsampling

                 The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels  of  the
                 output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .
                     yuv420p  samples  the  chroma  information of every other
                     horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples
                     the  color information of every horizontal line and every
                     other vertical line.

                     LoopCount (Gif Only)

                 The number of times you want the output gif  to  loop.  Valid
                 values  include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , in-
                 clusive.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              KeyframesMaxDist -> (string)
                 Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264
                 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                 The  maximum  number of frames between key frames. Key frames
                 are fully encoded frames; the frames between key  frames  are
                 encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The
                 value is an integer formatted as a string; valid  values  are
                 between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive.
                 A higher value results in higher  compression  but  may  also
                 discernibly decrease video quality.

                 For  Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio
                 to the KeyframesMaxDist . This  allows  Smooth  playlists  to
                 switch between different quality levels while the file is be-
                 ing played.

                 For example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with  a
                 KeyframesMaxDist  of 90. The output file then needs to have a
                 ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of  30,  25,
                 and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.

                 Alternately,  this  can  be  achieved by setting FrameRate to
                 auto  and  having  the  same  values  for  MaxFrameRate   and
                 KeyframesMaxDist .

              FixedGOP -> (string)
                 Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264
                 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .

                 Whether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values  are
                 true and false :

                 o true  :  Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the value of Keyframes-
                   MaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number  of
                   frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).

                 o false : The distance between key frames can vary.

                 WARNING:
                     FixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.

              BitRate -> (string)
                 The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilo-
                 bits/second. Valid values depend on the values of  Level  and
                 Profile  .  If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the
                 detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value
                 other  than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less
                 than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for
                 your level and profile:
                     Level  - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (base-
                     line and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in  kilo-
                     bits/second (high Profile)

                 o 1 - 64 : 80

                 o 1b - 128 : 160

                 o 4 - 20000 : 25000

                 o 4.1 - 50000 : 62500

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 The  frames  per  second  for  the video stream in the output
                 file. Valid values include:
                     auto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                 If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  uses  the  detected
                 frame  rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate,
                 we recommend that you perform the following calculation:
                     Frame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed  in  luma
                     samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)

                 where:

                 o width  in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolu-
                   tion of the output video.

                 o maximum recommended decoding speed in  Luma  samples/second
                   is  less  than  or equal to the maximum value listed in the
                   following table, based on the value that you specified  for
                   Level.

                 The maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second
                 for each level is described in the following  list  (Level  -
                 Decoding speed ):

                 o 1 - 380160

                 o 4 - 62914560

                 o 4.1 - 62914560

              MaxFrameRate -> (string)
                 If  you  specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses
                 the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate  of  the
                 output  video.  Specify  the maximum frame rate that you want
                 Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate  of  the  input
                 video  is  greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the
                 output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25
                 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .

              Resolution -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To  better  control resolution and aspect ratio of output
                     videos, we recommend that you use the values  MaxWidth  ,
                     MaxHeight  ,  SizingPolicy  ,  PaddingPolicy  ,  and Dis-
                     playAspectRatio instead of Resolution and  AspectRatio  .
                     The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not
                     use them together.

                 The width and height of the video in the output file, in pix-
                 els. Valid values are auto and width x height :

                 o auto  :  Elastic  Transcoder attempts to preserve the width
                   and height of the input  file,  subject  to  the  following
                   rules.

                 o

                   ``
                   width  x  height  ``  :  The width and height of the output
                   video in pixels.

                 Note the following about specifying the width and height:

                 o The width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, in-
                   clusive.

                 o The height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, in-
                   clusive.

                 o If you specify a resolution that is less than  the  resolu-
                   tion  of  the  input  file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
                   output file to the lower resolution.

                 o If you specify a resolution that is greater than the  reso-
                   lution  of  the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the
                   output to the higher resolution.

                 o We recommend that you specify a resolution  for  which  the
                   product  of  width  and height is less than or equal to the
                   applicable value in the following list (List - Max width  x

                     To  better  control resolution and aspect ratio of output
                     videos, we recommend that you use the values  MaxWidth  ,
                     MaxHeight  ,  SizingPolicy  ,  PaddingPolicy  ,  and Dis-
                     playAspectRatio instead of Resolution and  AspectRatio  .
                     The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not
                     use them together.

                 The display aspect ratio of the video  in  the  output  file.
                 Valid values include:
                     auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If  you  specify  auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve
                 the aspect ratio of the input file.

                 If you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that  dif-
                 fers  from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder
                 adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides)  or  letterboxing
                 (black bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the aspect ra-
                 tio of the active region of the video.

              MaxWidth -> (string)
                 The maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you spec-
                 ify  auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the de-
                 fault value. If you specify a numeric value,  enter  an  even
                 integer between 128 and 4096.

              MaxHeight -> (string)
                 The  maximum  height  of  the  output video in pixels. If you
                 specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as  the
                 default  value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even
                 integer between 96 and 3072.

              DisplayAspectRatio -> (string)
                 The value that Elastic Transcoder adds to the metadata in the
                 output file.

              SizingPolicy -> (string)
                 Specify one of the following values to control scaling of the
                 output video:

                 o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales  the  output  video  so  it
                   matches  the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or
                   MaxHeight without exceeding the other value.

                 o Fill : Elastic Transcoder scales the  output  video  so  it
                   matches  the value that you specified in either MaxWidth or
                   MaxHeight and matches or exceeds the other  value.  Elastic
                   Transcoder  centers  the  output video and then crops it in
                   the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

                 o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video  to
                   match  the  values that you specified for MaxWidth and Max-
                   Height . If the relative proportions of the input video and
                   the  output  video  are different, the output video will be
                   distorted.

                 o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output  video.
                   If  either  dimension of the input video exceeds the values
                   that you specified for MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight  ,  Elastic
                   Transcoder crops the output video.

                 o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic  Transcoder scales the output video
                   down so that its dimensions match the values that you spec-
                   ified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
                   exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic
                   Transcoder does not scale the video up.

                 o ShrinkToFill  :  Elastic Transcoder scales the output video
                   down so that its dimensions match the values that you spec-
                   ified  for  at  least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without
                   dropping below either value. If you  specify  this  option,
                   Elastic Transcoder does not scale the video up.

              PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                 When  you  set  PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder may
                 add black bars to the top and bottom and/or  left  and  right
                 sides  of the output video to make the total size of the out-
                 put video match the values that you  specified  for  MaxWidth
                 and MaxHeight .

              Watermarks -> (list)
                 Settings for the size, location, and opacity of graphics that
                 you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay over videos  that  are
                 transcoded using this preset. You can specify settings for up
                 to four watermarks. Watermarks appear in the  specified  size
                 and location, and with the specified opacity for the duration
                 of the transcoded video.

                 Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to dis-
                 play  a  watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png for-
                 mat, which supports transparency.

                 When you create a job that uses this preset, you specify  the
                 .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to in-
                 clude in the transcoded videos. You can specify fewer  graph-
                 ics  in  the  job  than you specify watermark settings in the
                 preset, which allows you to use the same  preset  for  up  to
                 four watermarks that have different dimensions.

                 (structure)
                     Settings  for the size, location, and opacity of graphics
                     that you want Elastic Transcoder to overlay  over  videos
                     that  are  transcoded  using this preset. You can specify
                     settings for up to four watermarks. Watermarks appear  in
                     the  specified  size and location, and with the specified
                     opacity for the duration of the transcoded video.

                     Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want  to
                     display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png
                     format, which supports transparency.

                     When you create a job that uses this preset, you  specify
                     the   .png   or  .jpg  graphics  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos.  You  can
                     specify fewer graphics in the job than you specify water-
                     mark settings in the preset, which allows you to use  the
                     same preset for up to four watermarks that have different
                     dimensions.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A unique identifier for the settings  for  one  water-
                        mark. The value of Id can be up to 40 characters long.

                     MaxWidth -> (string)
                        The  maximum width of the watermark in one of the fol-
                        lowing formats:

                        o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16  pix-
                          els,  and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether
                          you want Elastic Transcoder  to  include  the  black
                          bars  that  are added by Elastic Transcoder, if any,
                          in the calculation. If you specify the value in pix-
                          els,  it  must be less than or equal to the value of
                          MaxWidth .

                     MaxHeight -> (string)
                        The maximum height of the watermark in one of the fol-
                        lowing formats:

                        o number  of pixels (px): The minimum value is 16 pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100. Use the value of Target to specify whether
                          you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to include the black
                          bars that are added by Elastic Transcoder,  if  any,
                          in the calculation.

                        If  you  specify  the value in pixels, it must be less
                        than or equal to the value of MaxHeight .

                     SizingPolicy -> (string)
                        A value that controls scaling of the watermark:

                        o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales the watermark so  it
                          matches  the  value  that  you  specified  in either
                          MaxWidth or MaxHeight without  exceeding  the  other
                          value.

                        o Stretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the watermark
                          to match the values that you specified for  MaxWidth
                          and  MaxHeight  . If the relative proportions of the
                          watermark and the values of MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight
                          are different, the watermark will be distorted.

                        o ShrinkToFit  :  Elastic Transcoder scales the water-
                          mark down so that its dimensions  match  the  values
                          that  you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and
                          MaxHeight without exceeding  either  value.  If  you
                          specify  this  option,  Elastic  Transcoder does not
                          scale the watermark up.

                     HorizontalAlign -> (string)
                        The horizontal position of the  watermark  unless  you
                        specify a non-zero value for HorizontalOffset :

                        o Left  :  The  left  edge of the watermark is aligned
                          with the left border of the video.

                        o Right : The right edge of the watermark  is  aligned
                          with the right border of the video.

                        o Center  : The watermark is centered between the left
                          and right borders.

                     HorizontalOffset -> (string)
                        The amount by which you want the  horizontal  position
                        of the watermark to be offset from the position speci-
                        fied by HorizontalAlign:

                        o number of pixels (px): The minimum value is  0  pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxWidth.

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100.

                        For example, if you specify Left  for  HorizontalAlign
                        and  5px  for  HorizontalOffset , the left side of the
                        watermark appears 5 pixels from the left border of the
                        output video.
                            HorizontalOffset  is  only valid when the value of
                            HorizontalAlign is Left or Right . If you  specify
                            an  offset that causes the watermark to extend be-
                            yond  the  left  or  right  border   and   Elastic
                            Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark
                            is cropped. If Elastic Transcoder has added  black
                            bars,  the  watermark extends into the black bars.
                            If the watermark extends beyond the black bars, it
                            is cropped.

                        Use the value of Target to specify whether you want to
                        include the black  bars  that  are  added  by  Elastic
                        Transcoder, if any, in the offset calculation.

                     VerticalAlign -> (string)
                        The  vertical  position  of  the  watermark unless you
                        specify a non-zero value for VerticalOffset :

                        o Top : The top edge of the watermark is aligned  with
                          the top border of the video.

                        o Bottom : The bottom edge of the watermark is aligned
                          with the bottom border of the video.

                        o Center : The watermark is centered between  the  top
                          and bottom borders.

                     VerticalOffset -> (string)
                            VerticalOffset

                        The  amount by which you want the vertical position of
                        the watermark to be offset from the position specified
                        by VerticalAlign:

                        o number  of  pixels (px): The minimum value is 0 pix-
                          els, and the maximum value is the value of MaxHeight
                          .

                        o integer percentage (%): The range of valid values is
                          0 to 100.

                        For example, if you specify Top for VerticalAlign  and
                        5px  for VerticalOffset , the top of the watermark ap-
                        pears 5 pixels from  the  top  border  of  the  output
                        video.
                            VerticalOffset  is  only  valid  when the value of
                            VerticalAlign is Top or Bottom.

                        If you specify an offset that causes the watermark  to
                        extend  beyond  the  top  or bottom border and Elastic
                        Transcoder has not added black bars, the watermark  is
                        cropped.  If  Elastic Transcoder has added black bars,
                        the watermark extends into the black bars. If the  wa-
                        termark extends beyond the black bars, it is cropped.

                        Use  the  value  of Target to specify whether you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to include the black bars that  are
                        added  by  Elastic  Transcoder,  if any, in the offset
                        calculation.

                     Opacity -> (string)
                        A percentage that indicates how much you want a water-
                        mark to obscure the video in the location where it ap-
                        pears. Valid values are 0 (the watermark is invisible)
                        to 100 (the watermark completely obscures the video in
                        the specified location). The datatype  of  Opacity  is
                        float.

                        Elastic Transcoder supports transparent .png graphics.
                        If you use a transparent .png, the transparent portion
                        of  the  video appears as if you had specified a value
                        of 0 for Opacity . The .jpg file format  doesn't  sup-
                        port transparency.

                     Target -> (string)
                        A  value that determines how Elastic Transcoder inter-
                        prets values that you specified for HorizontalOffset ,
                        VerticalOffset , MaxWidth , and MaxHeight :

                        o Content : HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values
                          are calculated based on the borders of the video ex-
                          cluding  black  bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if
                          any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if speci-
                          fied  as  a  percentage, are calculated based on the
                          borders of the video excluding black bars  added  by
                          Elastic Transcoder, if any.

                        o Frame  :  HorizontalOffset and VerticalOffset values
                          are calculated based on the borders of the video in-
                          cluding  black  bars added by Elastic Transcoder, if
                          any. In addition, MaxWidth and MaxHeight , if speci-
                          fied  as  a  percentage, are calculated based on the
                          borders of the video including black bars  added  by
                          Elastic Transcoder, if any.

          Thumbnails -> (structure)
              A  section  of the response body that provides information about
              the thumbnail preset values, if any.

              Format -> (string)
                 The format of thumbnails, if any. Valid values  are  jpg  and
                 png .

                 You  specify  whether  you  want Elastic Transcoder to create
                 thumbnails when you create a job.

              Interval -> (string)
                 The approximate number of seconds between thumbnails. Specify
                 an integer value.

              Resolution -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To  better  control resolution and aspect ratio of thumb-
                     nails, we recommend that you use the  values  MaxWidth  ,
                     MaxHeight  ,  SizingPolicy , and PaddingPolicy instead of
                     Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups  of  settings
                     are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

                 The  width and height of thumbnail files in pixels. Specify a
                 value in the format `` width `` x ``  height  ``  where  both
                 values  are even integers. The values cannot exceed the width
                 and height that you specified in the Video:Resolution object.

              AspectRatio -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     To better control resolution and aspect ratio  of  thumb-
                     nails,  we  recommend  that you use the values MaxWidth ,
                     MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , and PaddingPolicy  instead  of
                     Resolution  and  AspectRatio . The two groups of settings
                     are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.

                 The aspect ratio of thumbnails. Valid values include:
                     auto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder  tries  to  preserve
                 the aspect ratio of the video in the output file.

              MaxWidth -> (string)
                 The  maximum  width  of  thumbnails in pixels. If you specify
                 auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as  the  default
                 value.  If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer
                 between 32 and 4096.

              MaxHeight -> (string)
                 The maximum height of thumbnails in pixels.  If  you  specify
                 auto,  Elastic  Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default
                 value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even  integer
                 between 32 and 3072.

              SizingPolicy -> (string)
                 Specify  one  of  the  following values to control scaling of
                 thumbnails:

                 o Fit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails  so  they  match
                   the  value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or Max-
                   Height settings without exceeding the other value.

                 o Fill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so  they  match
                   the  value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or Max-
                   Height settings and matches or  exceeds  the  other  value.
                   Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then
                   crops in the dimension (if any) that  exceeds  the  maximum
                   value.

                 o Stretch  : Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match
                   the values that you specified for  thumbnail  MaxWidth  and
                   MaxHeight  settings. If the relative proportions of the in-
                   put video and thumbnails are different, the thumbnails will
                   be distorted.

                 o Keep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If ei-
                   ther dimension of the input video exceeds the  values  that
                   you  specified  for  thumbnail  MaxWidth and MaxHeight set-
                   tings, Elastic Transcoder crops the thumbnails.

                 o ShrinkToFit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down  so
                   that  their  dimensions match the values that you specified
                   for at least one of thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight  with-
                   out  exceeding  either  value.  If you specify this option,
                   Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

                 o ShrinkToFill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so
                   that  their  dimensions match the values that you specified
                   for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping
                   below  either  value.  If  you specify this option, Elastic
                   Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.

              PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                 When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad ,  Elastic  Transcoder  may
                 add  black  bars  to the top and bottom and/or left and right
                 sides of thumbnails to make the total size of the  thumbnails
                 match  the  values  that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth
                 and MaxHeight settings.

          Type -> (string)
              Whether the preset is  a  default  preset  provided  by  Elastic
              Transcoder  (System  ) or a preset that you have defined (Custom
              ).

       Warning -> (string)
          If the preset settings don't comply with the standards for the video
          codec  but  Elastic  Transcoder created the preset, this message ex-
          plains the reason the preset settings don't meet the standard. Elas-
          tic Transcoder created the preset because the settings might produce
          acceptable output.
