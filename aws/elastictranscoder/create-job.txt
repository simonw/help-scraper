CREATE-JOB()                                                      CREATE-JOB()



NAME
       create-job -

DESCRIPTION
       When  you  create  a job, Elastic Transcoder returns JSON data that in-
       cludes the values that you specified plus  information  about  the  job
       that is created.

       If  you have specified more than one output for your jobs (for example,
       one output for the Kindle Fire and another output for the Apple  iPhone
       4s), you currently must use the Elastic Transcoder API to list the jobs
       (as opposed to the AWS Console).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-job
          --pipeline-id <value>
          [--input <value>]
          [--inputs <value>]
          [--outputs <value>]
          [--output-key-prefix <value>]
          [--playlists <value>]
          [--user-metadata <value>]
          [--job-output <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --pipeline-id (string)
          The Id of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to  use  for
          transcoding. The pipeline determines several settings, including the
          Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder  gets  the  files  to
          transcode  and  the  bucket  into  which Elastic Transcoder puts the
          transcoded files.

       --input (structure)
          A section of the request body that provides  information  about  the
          file that is being transcoded.

          Key -> (string)
              The  name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the body of the
              JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use  for  processing
              the  job.  The InputBucket object in that pipeline tells Elastic
              Transcoder which Amazon S3 bucket to get the file from.

              If the file name includes a prefix, such as  cooking/lasagna.mpg
              , include the prefix in the key. If the file isn't in the speci-
              fied bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

          FrameRate -> (string)
              The frame rate of the input file. If you want Elastic Transcoder
              to  automatically detect the frame rate of the input file, spec-
              ify auto . If you want to specify the frame rate for  the  input
              file, enter one of the following values:
                 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

              If you specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder dis-
              ables automatic detection of the frame rate.

          Resolution -> (string)
              This value must be auto , which causes Elastic Transcoder to au-
              tomatically detect the resolution of the input file.

          AspectRatio -> (string)
              The  aspect  ratio  of  the  input  file.  If  you  want Elastic
              Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect ratio of the input
              file, specify auto . If you want to specify the aspect ratio for
              the output file, enter one of the following values:
                 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

              If you specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder dis-
              ables automatic detection of the aspect ratio.

          Interlaced -> (string)
              Whether  the  input  file  is  interlaced.  If  you want Elastic
              Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file is in-
              terlaced,  specify auto . If you want to specify whether the in-
              put file is interlaced, enter one of the following values:
                 true , false

              If you specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder dis-
              ables automatic detection of interlacing.

          Container -> (string)
              The  container  type  for  the  input  file. If you want Elastic
              Transcoder to automatically detect the container type of the in-
              put  file,  specify  auto . If you want to specify the container
              type for the input file, enter one of the following values:
                 3gp , aac , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a , mkv , mov , mp3  ,
                 mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf , ogg , vob , wav , webm

          Encryption -> (structure)
              The  encryption  settings,  if any, that are used for decrypting
              your input files. If your input  file  is  encrypted,  you  must
              specify  the  mode  that Elastic Transcoder uses to decrypt your
              file.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The specific server-side encryption mode that you want  Elas-
                 tic Transcoder to use when decrypting your input files or en-
                 crypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                 following options:

                 o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the keys used for en-
                   crypting your files.

                 o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Management  Ser-
                   vice,  which creates and manages the keys that are used for
                   encrypting your files. If you specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                   don't want to use the default key, you must add the AWS-KMS
                   key that you want to use to your pipeline.

                 o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A  padded  cipher-block  mode  of  operation
                   originally used for HLS files.

                 o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                 o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation that
                   is an authenticated encryption format, meaning that a file,
                   key,  or  initialization vector that has been tampered with
                   fails the decryption process.

                 For all three AES options, you  must  provide  the  following
                 settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                 o Key

                 o Key MD5

                 o Initialization Vector

                 WARNING:
                     For  the AES modes, your private encryption keys and your
                     unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;  therefore,  it
                     is important that you safely manage your encryption keys.
                     If you lose them, you won't be  able  to  unencrypt  your
                     data.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use to encrypt your output file, or that was used to  encrypt
                 your  input  file. The key must be base64-encoded and it must
                 be one of the following bit lengths before  being  base64-en-
                 coded:
                     128 , 192 , or 256 .

                 The  key  must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key Man-
                 agement Service.

              KeyMd5 -> (string)
                 The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt your input
                 file,  or  that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt
                 your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a
                 checksum  to make sure your key was not corrupted in transit.
                 The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16
                 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              InitializationVector -> (string)
                 The  series of random bits created by a random bit generator,
                 unique for every encryption operation, that you used  to  en-
                 crypt your input files or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use to encrypt your output files. The  initialization  vector
                 must  be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long
                 before being base64-encoded.

          TimeSpan -> (structure)
              Settings for clipping an input. Each input  can  have  different
              clip settings.

              StartTime -> (string)
                 The  place  in the input file where you want a clip to start.
                 The  format  can  be  either  HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum   value:
                 23:59:59.999;  SSS  is  thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS
                 (maximum value: 86399.999). If you  don't  specify  a  value,
                 Elastic Transcoder starts at the beginning of the input file.

              Duration -> (string)
                 The   duration   of  the  clip.  The  format  can  be  either
                 HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths
                 of  a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you
                 don't specify a value, Elastic Transcoder creates  an  output
                 file from StartTime to the end of the file.

                 If  you specify a value longer than the duration of the input
                 file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file  and  returns  a
                 warning message.

          InputCaptions -> (structure)
              You  can  configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or
              subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must  be  in
              UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:

              o Embedded:  Embedded  captions are included in the same file as
                the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one  em-
                bedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded cap-
                tions per file. Valid input values include: CEA-608 (EIA-608 ,
                first  non-empty  channel  only),  CEA-708  (EIA-708  ,  first
                non-empty channel only), and mov-text   Valid outputs include:
                mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embed-
                ded format per output.

              o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file
                from  the  audio  and  video  data. Sidecar captions require a
                player that is capable of understanding the  relationship  be-
                tween  the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder
                supports only one sidecar caption per language, to  a  maximum
                of  20  sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include:
                dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc ,  smpt  ,  srt  ,
                ttml  (first div element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs in-
                clude: dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

              If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions,  specify  dfxp
              as your output format.

              Elastic  Transcoder  does  not  support  OCR  (Optical Character
              Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for cap-
              tions,  and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic
              Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, ital-
              ics) during the transcoding process.

              To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to
              null. To pass  through  existing  captions  unchanged,  set  the
              MergePolicy  to  MergeRetain , and pass in a null CaptionSources
              array.

              For more  information  on  embedded  files,  see  the  Subtitles
              Wikipedia page.

              For  more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Meta-
              data Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

              MergePolicy -> (string)
                 A policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder  handles  the
                 existence of multiple captions.

                 o MergeOverride:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded
                   and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for  a  lan-
                   guage  are  embedded in the input file and also appear in a
                   sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar  captions
                   and ignores the embedded captions for that language.

                 o MergeRetain:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes both embedded
                   and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for  a  lan-
                   guage  are  embedded in the input file and also appear in a
                   sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions
                   and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If Cap-
                   tionSources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all  sidecar
                   captions from the output files.

                 o Override:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes only the sidecar
                   captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                     MergePolicy cannot be null.

              CaptionSources -> (list)
                 Source files for the input sidecar captions used  during  the
                 transcoding process. To omit all sidecar captions, leave Cap-
                 tionSources blank.

                 (structure)
                     A source file for the input sidecar captions used  during
                     the transcoding process.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  sidecar caption file that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                     Language -> (string)
                        A string that specifies the language of  the  caption.
                        If  you  specified  multiple inputs with captions, the
                        caption language must match in order to be included in
                        the output. Specify this as one of:

                        o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                        o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                        For  more  information  on ISO language codes and lan-
                        guage names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                     TimeOffset -> (string)
                        For clip generation or captions that do not  start  at
                        the  same time as the associated video file, the Time-
                        Offset tells Elastic Transcoder how much of the  video
                        to encode before including captions.

                        Specify  the  TimeOffset  in  the  form  [+-]SS.sss or
                        [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                     Label -> (string)
                        The label of the caption  shown  in  the  player  when
                        choosing  a  language.  We  recommend that you put the
                        caption language name here, in  the  language  of  the
                        captions.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The   encryption   settings,   if  any,  that  Elastic
                        Transcoder needs to decyrpt your caption  sources,  or
                        that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply to your cap-
                        tion sources.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The specific server-side encryption mode that  you
                            want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use when decrypting
                            your input files or encrypting your output  files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key  Man-
                              agement  Service,  which creates and manages the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the default key, you must add  the  AWS-KMS  key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of op-
                              eration originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of  op-
                              eration that is an authenticated encryption for-
                              mat, meaning that a file, key, or initialization
                              vector that has been tampered with fails the de-
                              cryption process.

                            For all three AES options, you  must  provide  the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and your unencrypted data are never  stored  by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage your encryption keys. If you lose  them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  data  encryption  key  that  you want Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file,  or
                            that  was used to encrypt your input file. The key
                            must be base64-encoded and it must be one  of  the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your   input   file,  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output  file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum to make sure your key  was  not  corrupted  in
                            transit.  The  key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and
                            it must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The  series of random bits created by a random bit
                            generator, unique for every encryption  operation,
                            that  you used to encrypt your input files or that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output  files.  The  initialization vector must be
                            base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16  bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

          DetectedProperties -> (structure)
              The detected properties of the input file.

              Width -> (integer)
                 The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

              Height -> (integer)
                 The detected height of the input file, in pixels.

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 The detected frame rate of the input file, in frames per sec-
                 ond.

              FileSize -> (long)
                 The detected file size of the input file, in bytes.

              DurationMillis -> (long)
                 The detected duration of the input file, in milliseconds.

       --inputs (list)
          A section of the request body that provides  information  about  the
          files that are being transcoded.

          (structure)
              Information about the file that you're transcoding.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the body of
                 the JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use for  pro-
                 cessing  the  job.  The  InputBucket  object in that pipeline
                 tells Elastic Transcoder which Amazon S3 bucket  to  get  the
                 file from.

                 If   the   file   name  includes  a  prefix,  such  as  cook-
                 ing/lasagna.mpg , include the prefix in the key. If the  file
                 isn't  in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an
                 error.

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 The frame rate  of  the  input  file.  If  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to automatically detect the frame rate of the in-
                 put file, specify auto . If you want  to  specify  the  frame
                 rate for the input file, enter one of the following values:
                     10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                 If  you  specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of the frame rate.

              Resolution -> (string)
                 This value must be auto , which causes Elastic Transcoder  to
                 automatically detect the resolution of the input file.

              AspectRatio -> (string)
                 The  aspect  ratio  of  the  input  file. If you want Elastic
                 Transcoder to automatically detect the aspect  ratio  of  the
                 input  file, specify auto . If you want to specify the aspect
                 ratio for the output file, enter one of the following values:
                     1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If you specify a value other than auto ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of the aspect ratio.

              Interlaced -> (string)
                 Whether  the  input  file  is interlaced. If you want Elastic
                 Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file  is
                 interlaced, specify auto . If you want to specify whether the
                 input file is interlaced, enter one of the following values:
                     true , false

                 If you specify a value other than auto ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of interlacing.

              Container -> (string)
                 The  container  type  for the input file. If you want Elastic
                 Transcoder to automatically detect the container type of  the
                 input  file,  specify  auto . If you want to specify the con-
                 tainer type for the input file, enter one  of  the  following
                 values:
                     3gp  ,  aac  , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a , mkv , mov ,
                     mp3 , mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf , ogg , vob  ,
                     wav , webm

              Encryption -> (structure)
                 The encryption settings, if any, that are used for decrypting
                 your input files. If your input file is encrypted,  you  must
                 specify the mode that Elastic Transcoder uses to decrypt your
                 file.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The specific server-side encryption mode  that  you  want
                     Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting your input
                     files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder
                     supports the following options:

                     o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for en-
                       crypting your files.

                     o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Management
                       Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys that are
                       used  for  encrypting  your  files.  If   you   specify
                       s3-aws-kms  and  you don't want to use the default key,
                       you must add the AWS-KMS key that you want  to  use  to
                       your pipeline.

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  operation
                       that  is  an  authenticated  encryption format, meaning
                       that a file, key, or  initialization  vector  that  has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     o Key

                     o Key MD5

                     o Initialization Vector

                     WARNING:
                        For the AES modes, your private  encryption  keys  and
                        your  unencrypted data are never stored by AWS; there-
                        fore, it is important that you safely manage your  en-
                        cryption  keys. If you lose them, you won't be able to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The data encryption key that you want Elastic  Transcoder
                     to  use  to encrypt your output file, or that was used to
                     encrypt your input file. The key must  be  base64-encoded
                     and  it  must  be one of the following bit lengths before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The key must also be encrypted by using  the  Amazon  Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The  MD5  digest of the key that you used to encrypt your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest as a checksum to make sure your key was  not  cor-
                     rupted  in  transit.  The key MD5 must be base64-encoded,
                     and it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to  encrypt  your  input  files  or that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to use to encrypt your output files. The  ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              TimeSpan -> (structure)
                 Settings for clipping an input. Each input can have different
                 clip settings.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     The  place  in  the  input  file where you want a clip to
                     start. The format can  be  either  HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum
                     value:  23:59:59.999;  SSS is thousandths of a second) or
                     sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't  spec-
                     ify  a  value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the beginning
                     of the input file.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     The duration of  the  clip.  The  format  can  be  either
                     HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum  value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thou-
                     sandths  of  a  second)  or  sssss.SSS  (maximum   value:
                     86399.999).   If  you  don't  specify  a  value,  Elastic
                     Transcoder creates an output file from StartTime  to  the
                     end of the file.

                     If  you  specify  a value longer than the duration of the
                     input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes  the  file  and
                     returns a warning message.

              InputCaptions -> (structure)
                 You  can  configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions,
                 or subtitles, from one format to another. All  captions  must
                 be  in  UTF-8.  Elastic Transcoder supports two types of cap-
                 tions:

                 o Embedded: Embedded captions are included in the  same  file
                   as  the  audio  and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only
                   one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300  em-
                   bedded  captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values include:
                   CEA-608 (EIA-608 , first non-empty channel  only),  CEA-708
                   (EIA-708  ,  first  non-empty  channel  only), and mov-text
                   Valid outputs include: mov-text   Elastic  Transcoder  sup-
                   ports a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                 o Sidecar:  Sidecar  captions are kept in a separate metadata
                   file from the audio and video data.  Sidecar  captions  re-
                   quire  a  player that is capable of understanding the rela-
                   tionship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elas-
                   tic  Transcoder  supports only one sidecar caption per lan-
                   guage, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file.  Valid
                   input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt
                   , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and we-
                   bvtt    Valid  outputs  include:  dfxp  (first  div element
                   only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                 If you want ttml or  smpte-tt  compatible  captions,  specify
                 dfxp as your output format.

                 Elastic  Transcoder  does  not support OCR (Optical Character
                 Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid  input  for
                 captions,  and  is  not available for audio-only transcoding.
                 Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for ex-
                 ample, italics) during the transcoding process.

                 To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions
                 to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
                 MergePolicy  to  MergeRetain  ,  and  pass in a null Caption-
                 Sources array.

                 For more information on embedded  files,  see  the  Subtitles
                 Wikipedia page.

                 For  more  information  on  sidecar files, see the Extensible
                 Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  handles
                     the existence of multiple captions.

                     o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder transcodes both em-
                       bedded and sidecar captions into outputs.  If  captions
                       for  a language are embedded in the input file and also
                       appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder  uses  the
                       sidecar  captions and ignores the embedded captions for
                       that language.

                     o MergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both  embed-
                       ded  and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for
                       a language are embedded in the input file and also  ap-
                       pear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the em-
                       bedded captions and ignores the  sidecar  captions  for
                       that  language.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty, Elastic
                       Transcoder omits all sidecar captions from  the  output
                       files.

                     o Override:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the side-
                       car captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                        MergePolicy cannot be null.

                 CaptionSources -> (list)
                     Source files for the input sidecar captions  used  during
                     the  transcoding  process.  To omit all sidecar captions,
                     leave CaptionSources blank.

                     (structure)
                        A source file for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The name of the sidecar caption file that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                        Language -> (string)
                            A string that specifies the language of  the  cap-
                            tion.  If  you specified multiple inputs with cap-
                            tions, the caption language must match in order to
                            be included in the output. Specify this as one of:

                            o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                            o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                            For  more  information  on  ISO language codes and
                            language names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                        TimeOffset -> (string)
                            For clip generation or captions that do not  start
                            at the same time as the associated video file, the
                            TimeOffset tells Elastic Transcoder  how  much  of
                            the video to encode before including captions.

                            Specify  the  TimeOffset in the form [+-]SS.sss or
                            [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                        Label -> (string)
                            The label of the caption shown in the player  when
                            choosing a language. We recommend that you put the
                            caption language name here, in the language of the
                            captions.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The  encryption  settings,  if  any,  that Elastic
                            Transcoder needs to decyrpt your caption  sources,
                            or  that  you  want Elastic Transcoder to apply to
                            your caption sources.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use when de-
                               crypting your input files  or  encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization  vector  that  has been tampered with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following  settings,  which  must be base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For the AES modes, your private  encryption
                                   keys  and  your  unencrypted data are never
                                   stored by AWS; therefore, it  is  important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys. If you lose them, you won't  be  able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file,
                               or  that  was  used to encrypt your input file.
                               The key must be base64-encoded and it  must  be
                               one  of  the following bit lengths before being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The key must also be  encrypted  by  using  the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The  MD5 digest of the key that you used to en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file.
                               Elastic Transcoder uses the  key  digest  as  a
                               checksum  to  make  sure  your key was not cor-
                               rupted  in  transit.  The  key  MD5   must   be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The series of random bits created by  a  random
                               bit  generator, unique for every encryption op-
                               eration, that you used to  encrypt  your  input
                               files  or  that  you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               use to encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                               ization  vector  must be base64-encoded, and it
                               must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                               base64-encoded.

              DetectedProperties -> (structure)
                 The detected properties of the input file.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     The detected height of the input file, in pixels.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     The  detected frame rate of the input file, in frames per
                     second.

                 FileSize -> (long)
                     The detected file size of the input file, in bytes.

                 DurationMillis -> (long)
                     The detected duration of the input file, in milliseconds.

       --outputs (list)
          A section of the request body that provides  information  about  the
          transcoded  (target)  files.  We  recommend that you use the Outputs
          syntax instead of the Output syntax.

          (structure)
              The CreateJobOutput structure.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder
                 saves  the file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the Out-
                 putBucket object in the pipeline that  is  specified  by  the
                 pipeline ID. If a file with the specified name already exists
                 in the output bucket, the job fails.

              ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
                 Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails  for
                 your  videos  and,  if so, how you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 name the files.

                 If you don't want Elastic Transcoder  to  create  thumbnails,
                 specify "".

                 If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, spec-
                 ify the information that you want to include in the file name
                 for  each  thumbnail. You can specify the following values in
                 any sequence:

                 o ``{count}`` (Required) : If you want to create  thumbnails,
                   you  must  include  {count} in the ThumbnailPattern object.
                   Wherever you specify {count} , Elastic  Transcoder  adds  a
                   five-digit  sequence  number  (beginning  with  00001  ) to
                   thumbnail file names. The number indicates  where  a  given
                   thumbnail  appears  in  the  sequence  of  thumbnails for a
                   transcoded file.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify a literal value  and/or  {resolution}  but
                     you  omit  {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns a valida-
                     tion error and does not create the job.

                 o Literal values (Optional) : You can specify literal  values
                   anywhere  in  the ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you
                   can include them as a file name prefix or  as  a  delimiter
                   between {resolution} and {count} .

                 o ``{resolution}``   (Optional)   :   If   you  want  Elastic
                   Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name,  in-
                   clude {resolution} in the ThumbnailPattern object.

                 When  creating  thumbnails,  Elastic Transcoder automatically
                 saves the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears  in
                 the  preset  that you specified in the PresetID value of Cre-
                 ateJobOutput . Elastic Transcoder also appends the applicable
                 file name extension.

              ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  you  want Elastic
                 Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The specific server-side encryption mode  that  you  want
                     Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting your input
                     files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder
                     supports the following options:

                     o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for en-
                       crypting your files.

                     o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Management
                       Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys that are
                       used  for  encrypting  your  files.  If   you   specify
                       s3-aws-kms  and  you don't want to use the default key,
                       you must add the AWS-KMS key that you want  to  use  to
                       your pipeline.

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  operation
                       that  is  an  authenticated  encryption format, meaning
                       that a file, key, or  initialization  vector  that  has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     WARNING:
                        For the AES modes, your private  encryption  keys  and
                        your  unencrypted data are never stored by AWS; there-
                        fore, it is important that you safely manage your  en-
                        cryption  keys. If you lose them, you won't be able to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The data encryption key that you want Elastic  Transcoder
                     to  use  to encrypt your output file, or that was used to
                     encrypt your input file. The key must  be  base64-encoded
                     and  it  must  be one of the following bit lengths before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The key must also be encrypted by using  the  Amazon  Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The  MD5  digest of the key that you used to encrypt your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest as a checksum to make sure your key was  not  cor-
                     rupted  in  transit.  The key MD5 must be base64-encoded,
                     and it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to  encrypt  your  input  files  or that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to use to encrypt your output files. The  ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              Rotate -> (string)
                 The number of degrees clockwise by  which  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to rotate the output relative to the input. Enter
                 one of the following values: auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270 .  The
                 value  auto  generally  works  only  if  the file that you're
                 transcoding contains rotation metadata.

              PresetId -> (string)
                 The Id of the preset to use for this job. The  preset  deter-
                 mines  the  audio, video, and thumbnail settings that Elastic
                 Transcoder uses for transcoding.

              SegmentDuration -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

                 If you specify a preset in PresetId for which  the  value  of
                 Container  is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Segment-
                 Duration is the target maximum duration of  each  segment  in
                 seconds.  For  HLSv3  format playlists, each media segment is
                 stored  in  a  separate  .ts  file.  For  HLSv4  and   Smooth
                 playlists,  all  media segments for an output are stored in a
                 single file. Each segment is approximately the length of  the
                 SegmentDuration , though individual segments might be shorter
                 or longer.

                 The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration
                 of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration , the
                 duration of the  last  segment  is  the  remainder  of  total
                 length/SegmentDuration.

                 Elastic  Transcoder  creates  an output-specific playlist for
                 each output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add
                 an  output to the master playlist for this job, include it in
                 the OutputKeys of the associated playlist.

              Watermarks -> (list)
                 Information  about  the  watermarks  that  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to  add  to the video during transcoding. You can
                 specify up to four watermarks for each output.  Settings  for
                 each  watermark must be defined in the preset for the current
                 output.

                 (structure)
                     Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want  to
                     display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png
                     format, which supports transparency.

                     PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                        The  ID  of  the  watermark  settings   that   Elastic
                        Transcoder  uses to add watermarks to the video during
                        transcoding. The settings are in the preset  specified
                        by  Preset for the current output. In that preset, the
                        value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder  which
                        settings to use.

                     InputKey -> (string)
                        The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use
                        for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket
                        contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks
                        the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input  Bucket
                        object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                        If  the  file name includes a prefix, for example, lo-
                        gos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key. If the
                        file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder
                        returns an error.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The  specific server-side encryption mode that you
                            want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting
                            your  input files or encrypting your output files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys  used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Man-
                              agement Service, which creates and  manages  the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the  default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of op-
                              eration originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of op-
                              eration that is an authenticated encryption for-
                              mat, meaning that a file, key, or initialization
                              vector that has been tampered with fails the de-
                              cryption process.

                            For  all  three  AES options, you must provide the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and  your  unencrypted data are never stored by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage  your encryption keys. If you lose them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The data encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file, or
                            that was used to encrypt your input file. The  key
                            must  be  base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your  input  file,  or  that  you   want   Elastic
                            Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt your output file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum  to  make  sure  your key was not corrupted in
                            transit. The key MD5 must be  base64-encoded,  and
                            it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes long before being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you used to encrypt your input files or  that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                            base64-encoded,  and  it  must be exactly 16 bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

              AlbumArt -> (structure)
                 Information  about  the  album  art  that  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to  add  to  the file during transcoding. You can
                 specify up to twenty album artworks for each output. Settings
                 for  each  artwork must be defined in the job for the current
                 output.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  handles
                     the existence of multiple album artwork files.

                     o Replace:  The specified album art replaces any existing
                       album art.

                     o Prepend: The specified album art is placed in front  of
                       any existing album art.

                     o Append: The specified album art is placed after any ex-
                       isting album art.

                     o Fallback: If the original input file contains  artwork,
                       Elastic Transcoder uses that artwork for the output. If
                       the original input does not  contain  artwork,  Elastic
                       Transcoder uses the specified album art file.

                 Artwork -> (list)
                     The  file  to be used as album art. There can be multiple
                     artworks associated with an audio file, to a  maximum  of
                     20. Valid formats are .jpg and .png

                     (structure)
                        The  file to be used as album art. There can be multi-
                        ple artworks associated with an audio file, to a maxi-
                        mum of 20.

                        To  remove artwork or leave the artwork empty, you can
                        either set Artwork to null, or set the Merge Policy to
                        "Replace" and use an empty Artwork array.

                        To  pass  through  existing artwork unchanged, set the
                        Merge Policy to "Prepend",  "Append",  or  "Fallback",
                        and use an empty Artwork array.

                        InputKey -> (string)
                            The  name  of the file to be used as album art. To
                            determine which  Amazon  S3  bucket  contains  the
                            specified  file,  Elastic  Transcoder  checks  the
                            pipeline specified by PipelineId ; the InputBucket
                            object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                            If  the  file name includes a prefix, for example,
                            cooking/pie.jpg , include the prefix in  the  key.
                            If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic
                            Transcoder returns an error.

                        MaxWidth -> (string)
                            The maximum width of the output album art in  pix-
                            els. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses
                            600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric
                            value,  enter an even integer between 32 and 4096,
                            inclusive.

                        MaxHeight -> (string)
                            The maximum height of the output album art in pix-
                            els. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses
                            600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric
                            value,  enter an even integer between 32 and 3072,
                            inclusive.

                        SizingPolicy -> (string)
                            Specify one of the  following  values  to  control
                            scaling of the output album art:

                            o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so
                              it matches the value that you specified  in  ei-
                              ther MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the
                              other value.

                            o Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the  output  art
                              so  it  matches  the value that you specified in
                              either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches or  ex-
                              ceeds  the  other value. Elastic Transcoder cen-
                              ters the output art and then crops it in the di-
                              mension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

                            o Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output
                              art to match the values that you  specified  for
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight . If the relative propor-
                              tions of the input art and the  output  art  are
                              different, the output art will be distorted.

                            o Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the out-
                              put art. If either dimension of  the  input  art
                              exceeds   the  values  that  you  specified  for
                              MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight  ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                              crops the output art.

                            o ShrinkToFit:  Elastic Transcoder scales the out-
                              put art down so that its  dimensions  match  the
                              values  that  you  specified for at least one of
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding  either
                              value.  If  you  specify  this  option,  Elastic
                              Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                            o ShrinkToFill Elastic Transcoder scales the  out-
                              put  art  down  so that its dimensions match the
                              values that you specified for at  least  one  of
                              MaxWidth  and  MaxHeight  without dropping below
                              either value. If you specify this option,  Elas-
                              tic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                        PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                            When  you  set  PaddingPolicy  to  Pad  ,  Elastic
                            Transcoder may add white bars to the top and  bot-
                            tom  and/or left and right sides of the output al-
                            bum art to make the total size of the  output  art
                            match  the  values that you specified for MaxWidth
                            and MaxHeight .

                        AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                            The format of album art, if any. Valid formats are
                            .jpg and .png .

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The  encryption  settings,  if  any, that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to apply to your artwork.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use when de-
                               crypting your input files  or  encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization  vector  that  has been tampered with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following  settings,  which  must be base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For the AES modes, your private  encryption
                                   keys  and  your  unencrypted data are never
                                   stored by AWS; therefore, it  is  important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys. If you lose them, you won't  be  able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file,
                               or  that  was  used to encrypt your input file.
                               The key must be base64-encoded and it  must  be
                               one  of  the following bit lengths before being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The key must also be  encrypted  by  using  the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The  MD5 digest of the key that you used to en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file.
                               Elastic Transcoder uses the  key  digest  as  a
                               checksum  to  make  sure  your key was not cor-
                               rupted  in  transit.  The  key  MD5   must   be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The series of random bits created by  a  random
                               bit  generator, unique for every encryption op-
                               eration, that you used to  encrypt  your  input
                               files  or  that  you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               use to encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                               ization  vector  must be base64-encoded, and it
                               must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                               base64-encoded.

              Composition -> (list)
                 You  can  create an output file that contains an excerpt from
                 the input file. This excerpt, called a clip,  can  come  from
                 the  beginning,  middle,  or end of the file. The Composition
                 object contains settings for the clips that make up an output
                 file.  For the current release, you can only specify settings
                 for a single clip per output  file.  The  Composition  object
                 cannot be null.

                 (structure)
                     Settings  for  one  clip  in a composition. All jobs in a
                     playlist must have the same clip settings.

                     TimeSpan -> (structure)
                        Settings that determine when a  clip  begins  and  how
                        long it lasts.

                        StartTime -> (string)
                            The  place in the input file where you want a clip
                            to start. The format can  be  either  HH:mm:ss.SSS
                            (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths
                            of  a  second)  or   sssss.SSS   (maximum   value:
                            86399.999).  If you don't specify a value, Elastic
                            Transcoder starts at the beginning  of  the  input
                            file.

                        Duration -> (string)
                            The duration of the clip. The format can be either
                            HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS  is
                            thousandths  of  a  second)  or sssss.SSS (maximum
                            value: 86399.999). If you don't specify  a  value,
                            Elastic  Transcoder  creates  an  output file from
                            StartTime to the end of the file.

                            If you specify a value longer than the duration of
                            the  input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the
                            file and returns a warning message.

              Captions -> (structure)
                 You can configure Elastic Transcoder to  transcode  captions,
                 or  subtitles,  from one format to another. All captions must
                 be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two  types  of  cap-
                 tions:

                 o Embedded:  Embedded  captions are included in the same file
                   as the audio and video. Elastic  Transcoder  supports  only
                   one  embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 em-
                   bedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values  include:
                   CEA-608  (EIA-608  , first non-empty channel only), CEA-708
                   (EIA-708 , first  non-empty  channel  only),  and  mov-text
                   Valid  outputs  include: mov-text   Elastic Transcoder sup-
                   ports a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                 o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a  separate  metadata
                   file  from  the  audio and video data. Sidecar captions re-
                   quire a player that is capable of understanding  the  rela-
                   tionship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elas-
                   tic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption  per  lan-
                   guage,  to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid
                   input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt
                   , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and we-
                   bvtt   Valid  outputs  include:  dfxp  (first  div  element
                   only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                 If  you  want  ttml  or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                 dfxp as your output format.

                 Elastic Transcoder does not support  OCR  (Optical  Character
                 Recognition),  does  not accept pictures as a valid input for
                 captions, and is not available  for  audio-only  transcoding.
                 Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for ex-
                 ample, italics) during the transcoding process.

                 To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set  Captions
                 to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
                 MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and  pass  in  a  null  Caption-
                 Sources array.

                 For  more  information  on  embedded files, see the Subtitles
                 Wikipedia page.

                 For more information on sidecar  files,  see  the  Extensible
                 Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles
                     the existence of multiple captions.

                     o MergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes  both  em-
                       bedded  and  sidecar captions into outputs. If captions
                       for a language are embedded in the input file and  also
                       appear  in  a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the
                       sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions  for
                       that language.

                     o MergeRetain:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embed-
                       ded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions  for
                       a  language are embedded in the input file and also ap-
                       pear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the em-
                       bedded  captions  and  ignores the sidecar captions for
                       that language.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty,  Elastic
                       Transcoder  omits  all sidecar captions from the output
                       files.

                     o Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the  side-
                       car captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                        MergePolicy cannot be null.

                 CaptionSources -> (list)
                     Source  files  for the input sidecar captions used during
                     the transcoding process. To omit  all  sidecar  captions,
                     leave CaptionSources blank.

                     (structure)
                        A source file for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The name of the sidecar caption file that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                        Language -> (string)
                            A  string  that specifies the language of the cap-
                            tion. If you specified multiple inputs  with  cap-
                            tions, the caption language must match in order to
                            be included in the output. Specify this as one of:

                            o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                            o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                            For more information on  ISO  language  codes  and
                            language names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                        TimeOffset -> (string)
                            For  clip generation or captions that do not start
                            at the same time as the associated video file, the
                            TimeOffset  tells  Elastic  Transcoder how much of
                            the video to encode before including captions.

                            Specify the TimeOffset in the form  [+-]SS.sss  or
                            [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                        Label -> (string)
                            The  label of the caption shown in the player when
                            choosing a language. We recommend that you put the
                            caption language name here, in the language of the
                            captions.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  Elastic
                            Transcoder  needs to decyrpt your caption sources,
                            or that you want Elastic Transcoder  to  apply  to
                            your caption sources.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The  specific  server-side encryption mode that
                               you want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  de-
                               crypting  your  input  files or encrypting your
                               output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                               following options:

                               o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates and manages the keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls  the  Amazon  Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the keys that are used  for  encrypting  your
                                 files.  If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and you
                                 don't want to use the default key,  you  must
                                 add  the  AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode  of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization vector that has  been  tampered  with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following settings, which  must  be  base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For  the AES modes, your private encryption
                                   keys and your unencrypted  data  are  never
                                   stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys.  If  you lose them, you won't be able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The data encryption key that you  want  Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file,
                               or that was used to encrypt  your  input  file.
                               The  key  must be base64-encoded and it must be
                               one of the following bit lengths  before  being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The  key  must  also  be encrypted by using the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file.
                               Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the  key digest as a
                               checksum to make sure your  key  was  not  cor-
                               rupted   in   transit.  The  key  MD5  must  be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The  series  of random bits created by a random
                               bit generator, unique for every encryption  op-
                               eration,  that  you  used to encrypt your input
                               files or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
                               use  to encrypt your output files. The initial-
                               ization vector must be base64-encoded,  and  it
                               must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long before being
                               base64-encoded.

                 CaptionFormats -> (list)
                     The array of file formats for the output captions. If you
                     leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an er-
                     ror.

                     (structure)
                        The file format of the output captions. If  you  leave
                        this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                        Format -> (string)
                            The  format you specify determines whether Elastic
                            Transcoder generates an embedded or  sidecar  cap-
                            tion for this output.

                            o Valid Embedded Caption Formats:

                              o for FLAC : None

                              o For MP3 : None

                              o For MP4 : mov-text

                              o For MPEG-TS : None

                              o For ogg : None

                              o For webm : None

                            o Valid    Sidecar    Caption   Formats:   Elastic
                              Transcoder  supports  dfxp  (first  div  element
                              only), scc, srt, and webvtt. If you want ttml or
                              smpte-tt compatible captions,  specify  dfxp  as
                              your output format.

                              o For FMP4 : dfxp

                              o Non-FMP4 outputs : All sidecar types
                               fmp4 captions have an extension of .ismt

                        Pattern -> (string)
                            The  prefix for caption filenames, in the form de-
                            scription -{language} , where:

                            o description is a description of the video.

                            o {language}  is  a  literal  value  that  Elastic
                              Transcoder  replaces with the two- or three-let-
                              ter code for the language of the caption in  the
                              output file names.

                            If  you  don't include {language} in the file name
                            pattern, Elastic Transcoder automatically  appends
                            "{language}  "  to  the value that you specify for
                            the description. In addition,  Elastic  Transcoder
                            automatically  appends the count to the end of the
                            segment files.

                            For example, suppose you're transcoding  into  srt
                            format.  When  you  enter  "Sydney-{language}-sun-
                            rise", and the language of the captions is English
                            (en),  the  name  of  the first caption file is be
                            Sydney-en-sunrise00000.srt.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings, if  any,  that  you  want
                            Elastic  Transcoder  to apply to your caption for-
                            mats.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use when de-
                               crypting your input files  or  encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization  vector  that  has been tampered with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following  settings,  which  must be base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                 You can specify encryption settings for any output files that
                 you want to use for a transcoding job. This includes the out-
                 put  file  and any watermarks, thumbnails, album art, or cap-
                 tions that you want to use. You must specify encryption  set-

                       you  must  add  the AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                       your pipeline.

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation
                       that is an  authenticated  encryption  format,  meaning
                       that  a  file,  key,  or initialization vector that has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     o Key

                     o Key MD5

                     o Initialization Vector

                     WARNING:
                        For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys and
                        your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;  there-
                        fore,  it is important that you safely manage your en-
                        cryption keys. If you lose them, you won't be able  to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  data encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder
                     to use to encrypt your output file, or that was  used  to
                     encrypt  your  input file. The key must be base64-encoded
                     and it must be one of the following  bit  lengths  before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The  key  must  also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  encrypt  your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest  as  a checksum to make sure your key was not cor-
                     rupted in transit. The key MD5  must  be  base64-encoded,
                     and  it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to encrypt your input files  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output files. The ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

       --output-key-prefix (string)
          The  value,  if  any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to prepend to
          the names of all files  that  this  job  creates,  including  output
          files, thumbnails, and playlists.

       --playlists (list)
          If you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Container
          is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists contains  infor-
          mation  about  the master playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder
          to create.

          The maximum number of master playlists in a job is 30.

          (structure)
              Information about the master playlist.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name that you want Elastic Transcoder to  assign  to  the
                 master  playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If the name
                 includes a / character, the section of the  name  before  the
                 last  / must be identical for all Name objects. If you create
                 more than one master playlist, the values of all Name objects
                 must be unique.

                 NOTE:
                     Elastic  Transcoder  automatically  appends  the relevant
                     file extension to the file  name  (.m3u8  for  HLSv3  and
                     HLSv4   playlists,   and   .ism   and  .ismc  for  Smooth
                     playlists). If you include a file extension in Name , the
                     file name will have two extensions.

              Format -> (string)
                 The  format  of  the  output  playlist. Valid formats include
                 HLSv3 , HLSv4 , and Smooth .

              OutputKeys -> (list)
                 For each output in this job that you want  to  include  in  a
                 master playlist, the value of the Outputs:Key object.

                 o If  your output is not HLS or does not have a segment dura-
                   tion set, the name of the output file is a concatenation of
                   OutputKeyPrefix  and  Outputs:Key  :  OutputKeyPrefix``Out-
                   puts:Key``

                 o If your output is HLSv3 and has a segment duration set,  or
                   is  not  included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder creates
                   an output playlist file with a file extension  of  .m3u8  ,
                   and a series of .ts files that include a five-digit sequen-
                   tial counter beginning  with  00000:  OutputKeyPrefix``Out-
                   puts:Key`` .m3u8 OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key`` 00000.ts

                 o If  your  output is HLSv4 , has a segment duration set, and
                   is included in an HLSv4 playlist, Elastic  Transcoder  cre-
                   ates  an  output  playlist  file  with  a file extension of
                   _v4.m3u8 . If the output is video, Elastic Transcoder  also
                   creates  an output file with an extension of _iframe.m3u8 :
                   OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``    _v4.m3u8    OutputKeyPre-
                   fix``Outputs:Key``    _iframe.m3u8    OutputKeyPrefix``Out-
                   puts:Key`` .ts

                 Elastic Transcoder automatically appends  the  relevant  file
                 extension  to  the file name. If you include a file extension
                 in Output Key, the file name will have two extensions.

                 If you include more than one output in a playlist,  any  seg-
                 ment  duration  settings,  clip settings, or caption settings
                 must be the same for all outputs in the playlist. For  Smooth
                 playlists,   the   Audio:Profile   ,   Video:Profile   ,  and
                 Video:FrameRate to Video:KeyframesMaxDist ratio must  be  the
                 same for all outputs.

                 (string)

              HlsContentProtection -> (structure)
                 The  HLS  content  protection settings, if any, that you want
                 Elastic Transcoder to apply to the  output  files  associated
                 with this playlist.

                 Method -> (string)
                     The  content  protection method for your output. The only
                     valid value is: aes-128 .

                     This value is written into the method  attribute  of  the
                     EXT-X-KEY metadata tag in the output playlist.

                 Key -> (string)
                     If you want Elastic Transcoder to generate a key for you,
                     leave this field blank.

                     If you choose to supply your own key,  you  must  encrypt
                     the key by using AWS KMS. The key must be base64-encoded,
                     and it must be one of the following  bit  lengths  before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     If Elastic Transcoder is generating your key for you, you
                     must leave this field blank.

                     The  MD5  digest  of  the  key  that  you  want   Elastic
                     Transcoder  to  use to encrypt your output file, and that
                     you want Elastic Transcoder to use as a checksum to  make
                     sure  your  key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5
                     must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly  16  bytes
                     before being base64- encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     If Elastic Transcoder is generating your key for you, you
                     must leave this field blank.

                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you want
                     Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your  output  files.
                     The  initialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it
                     must be exactly 16 bytes before being base64-encoded.

                 LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                     The location of the license key required to decrypt  your
                     HLS  playlist.  The  URL must be an absolute path, and is
                     referenced in the URI attribute of the EXT-X-KEY metadata
                     tag in the playlist file.

                 KeyStoragePolicy -> (string)
                     Specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder to write your
                     HLS license key to an Amazon S3  bucket.  If  you  choose
                     WithVariantPlaylists , LicenseAcquisitionUrl must be left
                     blank and Elastic Transcoder writes your  data  key  into
                     the same bucket as the associated playlist.

              PlayReadyDrm -> (structure)
                 The DRM settings, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 apply to the output files associated with this playlist.

                 Format -> (string)
                     The type of DRM, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder
                     to  apply  to  the  output  files  associated  with  this
                     playlist.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The DRM key for your file, provided by your  DRM  license
                     provider.  The key must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     one of the following bit lengths before being  base64-en-
                     coded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The key must also be encrypted by using AWS KMS.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The  MD5 digest of the key used for DRM on your file, and
                     that you want Elastic Transcoder to use as a checksum  to
                     make  sure your key was not corrupted in transit. The key
                     MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it  must  be  exactly  16
                     bytes before being base64-encoded.

                 KeyId -> (string)
                     The  ID  for  your  DRM  key,  so  that  your DRM license
                     provider knows which key to provide.

                     The key ID must be provided in big  endian,  and  Elastic
                     Transcoder  converts it to little endian before inserting
                     it into the PlayReady DRM  headers.  If  you  are  unsure
                     whether  your  license server provides your key ID in big
                     or little endian, check with your DRM provider.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you want
                     Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your files. The ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 8 bytes long before being base64-encoded.  If  no
                     initialization  vector  is  provided,  Elastic Transcoder
                     generates one for you.

                 LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                     The location of the license key required to play DRM con-
                     tent. The URL must be an absolute path, and is referenced
                     by the PlayReady header. The PlayReady header  is  refer-
                     enced in the protection header of the client manifest for
                     Smooth Streaming outputs,  and  in  the  EXT-X-DXDRM  and
                     EXT-XDXDRMINFO metadata tags for HLS playlist outputs. An
                     example URL looks like this:  https://www.example.com/ex-
                     ampleKey/

       --user-metadata (map)
          User-defined  metadata  that  you  want to associate with an Elastic
          Transcoder job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs, and you can
          add  up  to  10 key/value pairs per job. Elastic Transcoder does not
          guarantee that key/value pairs are returned in  the  same  order  in
          which you specify them.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --job-output (structure)
          A  section  of  the request body that provides information about the
          transcoded (target) file. We strongly recommend  that  you  use  the
          Outputs syntax instead of the Output syntax.

          Key -> (string)
              The  name  to  assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder
              saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the  Output-
              Bucket  object in the pipeline that is specified by the pipeline
              ID. If a file with the specified name already exists in the out-
              put bucket, the job fails.

          ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
              Whether  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder to create thumbnails for
              your videos and, if so, how you want Elastic Transcoder to  name
              the files.

              If you don't want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, spec-
              ify "".

              If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails,  specify
              the  information  that  you want to include in the file name for
              each thumbnail. You can specify the following values in any  se-
              quence:

              o ``{count}`` (Required) : If you want to create thumbnails, you
                must include {count} in the ThumbnailPattern object.  Wherever
                you specify {count} , Elastic Transcoder adds a five-digit se-
                quence number (beginning with 00001 ) to thumbnail file names.
                The  number  indicates  where a given thumbnail appears in the
                sequence of thumbnails for a transcoded file.

              WARNING:
                 If you specify a literal value and/or  {resolution}  but  you
                 omit  {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns a validation error
                 and does not create the job.

              o Literal values (Optional) : You  can  specify  literal  values
                anywhere  in the ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you can
                include them as a file name prefix or as a  delimiter  between
                {resolution} and {count} .

              o ``{resolution}``  (Optional)  : If you want Elastic Transcoder
                to include the resolution in the file name,  include  {resolu-
                tion} in the ThumbnailPattern object.

              When creating thumbnails, Elastic Transcoder automatically saves
              the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears in the  pre-
              set  that you specified in the PresetID value of CreateJobOutput
              . Elastic Transcoder also appends the applicable file  name  ex-
              tension.

          ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
              The   encryption   settings,  if  any,  that  you  want  Elastic
              Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The specific server-side encryption mode that you want  Elas-
                 tic Transcoder to use when decrypting your input files or en-
                 crypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                 following options:

                 o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the keys used for en-
                   crypting your files.

                 o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Management  Ser-
                   vice,  which creates and manages the keys that are used for
                   encrypting your files. If you specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                   don't want to use the default key, you must add the AWS-KMS
                   key that you want to use to your pipeline.

                 o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A  padded  cipher-block  mode  of  operation
                   originally used for HLS files.

                 o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                 o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation that
                   is an authenticated encryption format, meaning that a file,
                   key,  or  initialization vector that has been tampered with
                   fails the decryption process.

                 For all three AES options, you  must  provide  the  following
                 settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                 o Key

                 o Key MD5

                 o Initialization Vector

                 WARNING:
                     For  the AES modes, your private encryption keys and your
                     unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;  therefore,  it
                     is important that you safely manage your encryption keys.
                     If you lose them, you won't be  able  to  unencrypt  your
                     data.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use to encrypt your output file, or that was used to  encrypt
                 your  input  file. The key must be base64-encoded and it must
                 be one of the following bit lengths before  being  base64-en-
                 coded:
                     128 , 192 , or 256 .

                 The  key  must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key Man-
                 agement Service.

              KeyMd5 -> (string)
                 The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt your input
                 file,  or  that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt
                 your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a
                 checksum  to make sure your key was not corrupted in transit.
                 The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16
                 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              InitializationVector -> (string)
                 The  series of random bits created by a random bit generator,
                 unique for every encryption operation, that you used  to  en-
                 crypt your input files or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use to encrypt your output files. The  initialization  vector
                 must  be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long
                 before being base64-encoded.

          Rotate -> (string)
              The number of  degrees  clockwise  by  which  you  want  Elastic
              Transcoder to rotate the output relative to the input. Enter one
              of the following values: auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270 .  The  value
              auto  generally  works  only if the file that you're transcoding
              contains rotation metadata.

          PresetId -> (string)
              The Id of the preset to use for this job. The preset  determines
              the audio, video, and thumbnail settings that Elastic Transcoder
              uses for transcoding.

          SegmentDuration -> (string)

              WARNING:
                 (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

              If you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of  Con-
              tainer is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), SegmentDuration
              is the target maximum duration of each segment in  seconds.  For
              HLSv3  format playlists, each media segment is stored in a sepa-
              rate .ts file. For HLSv4 and Smooth playlists,  all  media  seg-
              ments for an output are stored in a single file. Each segment is
              approximately the length of the SegmentDuration ,  though  indi-
              vidual segments might be shorter or longer.

              The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of
              the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration , the dura-
              tion  of  the last segment is the remainder of total length/Seg-
              mentDuration.

              Elastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist for  each
              output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add an out-
              put to the master playlist for this job, include it in the  Out-
              putKeys of the associated playlist.

          Watermarks -> (list)
              Information   about   the   watermarks  that  you  want  Elastic
              Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can spec-
              ify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each wa-
              termark must be defined in the preset for the current output.

              (structure)
                 Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to dis-
                 play  a  watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png for-
                 mat, which supports transparency.

                 PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                     The ID of the watermark settings that Elastic  Transcoder
                     uses  to  add watermarks to the video during transcoding.
                     The settings are in the preset specified  by  Preset  for
                     the  current  output. In that preset, the value of Water-
                     marks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.

                 InputKey -> (string)
                     The name of the .png or .jpg file that you  want  to  use
                     for  the  watermark.  To determine which Amazon S3 bucket
                     contains the specified file,  Elastic  Transcoder  checks
                     the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket ob-
                     ject in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                     If the file name includes  a  prefix,  for  example,  lo-
                     gos/128x64.png  ,  include  the prefix in the key. If the
                     file isn't in the specified  bucket,  Elastic  Transcoder
                     returns an error.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The  encryption  settings,  if any, that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to use when decrypting your input
                        files  or  encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Manage-
                          ment  Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys
                          that are used for  encrypting  your  files.  If  you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use the de-
                          fault key, you must add the  AWS-KMS  key  that  you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  opera-
                          tion  that  is  an  authenticated encryption format,
                          meaning that a file, key, or  initialization  vector
                          that  has  been  tampered  with fails the decryption
                          process.

                        For all three AES options, you must provide  the  fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore,  it is important that you safely manage
                            your encryption keys. If you lose them, you  won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The   data   encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was  used  to encrypt your input file. The key must be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The MD5 digest of the key that  you  used  to  encrypt
                        your  input  file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses  the  key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                        key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must  be
                        base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16 bytes long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator,  unique  for  every encryption operation, that
                        you used to encrypt your input files or that you  want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your output
                        files. The initialization vector  must  be  base64-en-
                        coded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before be-
                        ing base64-encoded.

          AlbumArt -> (structure)
              Information about the album art that you want Elastic Transcoder
              to  add  to  the  file during transcoding. You can specify up to
              twenty album artworks for each output. Settings for each artwork
              must be defined in the job for the current output.

              MergePolicy -> (string)
                 A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the
                 existence of multiple album artwork files.

                 o Replace: The specified album art replaces any existing  al-
                   bum art.

                 o Prepend:  The specified album art is placed in front of any
                   existing album art.

                 o Append: The specified album art is placed after any  exist-
                   ing album art.

                 o Fallback:  If  the  original  input  file contains artwork,
                   Elastic Transcoder uses that artwork for the output. If the
                   original input does not contain artwork, Elastic Transcoder
                   uses the specified album art file.

              Artwork -> (list)
                 The file to be used as album art. There can be multiple  art-
                 works  associated  with  an  audio  file, to a maximum of 20.
                 Valid formats are .jpg and .png

                 (structure)
                     The file to be used as album art. There can  be  multiple
                     artworks  associated  with an audio file, to a maximum of
                     20.

                     To remove artwork or leave the artwork empty, you can ei-
                     ther set Artwork to null, or set the Merge Policy to "Re-
                     place" and use an empty Artwork array.

                     To pass through existing artwork unchanged, set the Merge
                     Policy  to "Prepend", "Append", or "Fallback", and use an
                     empty Artwork array.

                     InputKey -> (string)
                        The name of the file to be used as album art.  To  de-
                        termine  which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified
                        file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified
                        by  PipelineId  ; the InputBucket object in that pipe-
                        line identifies the bucket.

                        If the file name includes a prefix, for example, cook-
                        ing/pie.jpg  ,  include  the prefix in the key. If the
                        file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder
                        returns an error.

                     MaxWidth -> (string)
                        The  maximum  width of the output album art in pixels.
                        If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses  600  as
                        the default value. If you specify a numeric value, en-
                        ter an even integer between 32 and 4096, inclusive.

                     MaxHeight -> (string)
                        The maximum height of the output album art in  pixels.
                        If  you  specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 600 as
                        the default value. If you specify a numeric value, en-
                        ter an even integer between 32 and 3072, inclusive.

                     SizingPolicy -> (string)
                        Specify one of the following values to control scaling
                        of the output album art:

                        o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so  it
                          matches  the  value  that  you  specified  in either
                          MaxWidth or MaxHeight without  exceeding  the  other
                          value.

                        o Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so it
                          matches the  value  that  you  specified  in  either
                          MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight  and  matches or exceeds the
                          other value. Elastic Transcoder centers  the  output
                          art and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that
                          exceeds the maximum value.

                        o Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output art
                          to  match the values that you specified for MaxWidth
                          and MaxHeight . If the relative proportions  of  the
                          input art and the output art are different, the out-
                          put art will be distorted.

                        o Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale  the  output
                          art.  If  either  dimension of the input art exceeds
                          the values that you specified for MaxWidth and  Max-
                          Height , Elastic Transcoder crops the output art.

                        o ShrinkToFit:  Elastic  Transcoder  scales the output
                          art down so that its  dimensions  match  the  values
                          that  you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and
                          MaxHeight without exceeding  either  value.  If  you
                          specify  this  option,  Elastic  Transcoder does not
                          scale the art up.

                        o ShrinkToFill Elastic Transcoder  scales  the  output
                          art  down  so  that  its dimensions match the values
                          that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth  and
                          MaxHeight  without  dropping  below either value. If
                          you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not
                          scale the art up.

                     PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                        When you set PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder
                        may add white bars to the top and bottom  and/or  left
                        and  right  sides  of the output album art to make the
                        total size of the output art match the values that you
                        specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

                     AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                        The  format  of  album  art, if any. Valid formats are
                        .jpg and .png .

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to your artwork.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The  specific server-side encryption mode that you
                            want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting
                            your  input files or encrypting your output files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys  used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Man-
                              agement Service, which creates and  manages  the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the  default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of op-
                              eration originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of op-
                              eration that is an authenticated encryption for-
                              mat, meaning that a file, key, or initialization
                              vector that has been tampered with fails the de-
                              cryption process.

                            For  all  three  AES options, you must provide the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and  your  unencrypted data are never stored by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage  your encryption keys. If you lose them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The data encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file, or
                            that was used to encrypt your input file. The  key
                            must  be  base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your  input  file,  or  that  you   want   Elastic
                            Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt your output file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum  to  make  sure  your key was not corrupted in
                            transit. The key MD5 must be  base64-encoded,  and
                            it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes long before being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you used to encrypt your input files or  that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                            base64-encoded,  and  it  must be exactly 16 bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

          Composition -> (list)
              You can create an output file that contains an excerpt from  the
              input  file.  This excerpt, called a clip, can come from the be-
              ginning, middle, or end of the file. The Composition object con-
              tains  settings  for  the clips that make up an output file. For
              the current release, you can only specify settings for a  single
              clip per output file. The Composition object cannot be null.

              (structure)
                 Settings  for  one  clip  in  a  composition.  All  jobs in a
                 playlist must have the same clip settings.

                 TimeSpan -> (structure)
                     Settings that determine when a clip begins and  how  long
                     it lasts.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The  place  in the input file where you want a clip to
                        start. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum
                        value:  23:59:59.999;  SSS is thousandths of a second)
                        or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you  don't
                        specify  a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the be-
                        ginning of the input file.

                     Duration -> (string)
                        The duration of the clip. The  format  can  be  either
                        HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999;  SSS  is
                        thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum  value:
                        86399.999).  If  you  don't  specify  a value, Elastic
                        Transcoder creates an output file  from  StartTime  to
                        the end of the file.

                        If you specify a value longer than the duration of the
                        input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and
                        returns a warning message.

          Captions -> (structure)
              You  can  configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or
              subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must  be  in
              UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:

              o Embedded:  Embedded  captions are included in the same file as
                the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one  em-
                bedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded cap-
                tions per file. Valid input values include: CEA-608 (EIA-608 ,
                first  non-empty  channel  only),  CEA-708  (EIA-708  ,  first
                non-empty channel only), and mov-text   Valid outputs include:
                mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embed-
                ded format per output.

              o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file
                from  the  audio  and  video  data. Sidecar captions require a
                player that is capable of understanding the  relationship  be-
                tween  the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder
                supports only one sidecar caption per language, to  a  maximum
                of  20  sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include:
                dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc ,  smpt  ,  srt  ,
                ttml  (first div element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs in-
                clude: dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

              If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions,  specify  dfxp
              as your output format.

              Elastic  Transcoder  does  not  support  OCR  (Optical Character
              Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for cap-
              tions,  and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic
              Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, ital-
              ics) during the transcoding process.

              To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to
              null. To pass  through  existing  captions  unchanged,  set  the
              MergePolicy  to  MergeRetain , and pass in a null CaptionSources
              array.

              For more  information  on  embedded  files,  see  the  Subtitles
              Wikipedia page.

              For  more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Meta-
              data Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

              MergePolicy -> (string)
                 A policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder  handles  the
                 existence of multiple captions.

                 o MergeOverride:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded
                   and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for  a  lan-
                   guage  are  embedded in the input file and also appear in a
                   sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar  captions
                   and ignores the embedded captions for that language.

                 o MergeRetain:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes both embedded
                   and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for  a  lan-
                   guage  are  embedded in the input file and also appear in a
                   sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions
                   and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If Cap-
                   tionSources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all  sidecar
                   captions from the output files.

                 o Override:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes only the sidecar
                   captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                     MergePolicy cannot be null.

              CaptionSources -> (list)
                 Source files for the input sidecar captions used  during  the
                 transcoding process. To omit all sidecar captions, leave Cap-
                 tionSources blank.

                 (structure)
                     A source file for the input sidecar captions used  during
                     the transcoding process.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  name  of  the  sidecar caption file that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                     Language -> (string)
                        A string that specifies the language of  the  caption.
                        If  you  specified  multiple inputs with captions, the
                        caption language must match in order to be included in
                        the output. Specify this as one of:

                        o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                        o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                        For  more  information  on ISO language codes and lan-
                        guage names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                     TimeOffset -> (string)
                        For clip generation or captions that do not  start  at
                        the  same time as the associated video file, the Time-
                        Offset tells Elastic Transcoder how much of the  video
                        to encode before including captions.

                        Specify  the  TimeOffset  in  the  form  [+-]SS.sss or
                        [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                     Label -> (string)
                        The label of the caption  shown  in  the  player  when
                        choosing  a  language.  We  recommend that you put the
                        caption language name here, in  the  language  of  the
                        captions.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The   encryption   settings,   if  any,  that  Elastic
                        Transcoder needs to decyrpt your caption  sources,  or
                        that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply to your cap-
                        tion sources.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The specific server-side encryption mode that  you
                            want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use when decrypting
                            your input files or encrypting your output  files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key  Man-
                              agement  Service,  which creates and manages the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the default key, you must add  the  AWS-KMS  key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of op-
                              eration originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of  op-
                              eration that is an authenticated encryption for-
                              mat, meaning that a file, key, or initialization
                              vector that has been tampered with fails the de-
                              cryption process.

                            For all three AES options, you  must  provide  the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and your unencrypted data are never  stored  by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage your encryption keys. If you lose  them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  data  encryption  key  that  you want Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file,  or
                            that  was used to encrypt your input file. The key
                            must be base64-encoded and it must be one  of  the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your   input   file,  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output  file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum to make sure your key  was  not  corrupted  in
                            transit.  The  key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and
                            it must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The  series of random bits created by a random bit
                            generator, unique for every encryption  operation,
                            that  you used to encrypt your input files or that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output  files.  The  initialization vector must be
                            base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16  bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

              CaptionFormats -> (list)
                 The  array  of  file  formats for the output captions. If you
                 leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                 (structure)
                     The file format of the output captions. If you leave this
                     value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                     Format -> (string)
                        The  format  you  specify  determines  whether Elastic
                        Transcoder generates an embedded  or  sidecar  caption
                        for this output.

                        o Valid Embedded Caption Formats:

                          o for FLAC : None

                          o For MP3 : None

                          o For MP4 : mov-text

                          o For MPEG-TS : None

                          o For ogg : None

                          o For webm : None

                        o Valid  Sidecar  Caption  Formats: Elastic Transcoder
                          supports dfxp (first div element  only),  scc,  srt,
                          and  webvtt. If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible
                          captions, specify dfxp as your output format.

                          o For FMP4 : dfxp

                          o Non-FMP4 outputs : All sidecar types
                            fmp4 captions have an extension of .ismt

                     Pattern -> (string)
                        The prefix for caption filenames, in the form descrip-
                        tion -{language} , where:

                        o description is a description of the video.

                        o {language}   is   a   literal   value  that  Elastic
                          Transcoder replaces with the  two-  or  three-letter
                          code  for  the language of the caption in the output
                          file names.

                        If you don't include {language} in the file name  pat-
                        tern,  Elastic Transcoder automatically appends "{lan-
                        guage} " to the value that you  specify  for  the  de-
                        scription.  In  addition, Elastic Transcoder automati-
                        cally appends the count to  the  end  of  the  segment
                        files.

                        For  example, suppose you're transcoding into srt for-
                        mat. When you enter  "Sydney-{language}-sunrise",  and
                        the language of the captions is English (en), the name
                        of  the  first  caption  file  is  be   Sydney-en-sun-
                        rise00000.srt.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to your caption formats.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The specific server-side encryption mode that  you
                            want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use when decrypting
                            your input files or encrypting your output  files.

          Encryption -> (structure)
              You  can  specify  encryption settings for any output files that
              you want to use for a transcoding job. This includes the  output
              file and any watermarks, thumbnails, album art, or captions that
              you want to use. You must specify encryption settings  for  each
              file individually.

              Mode -> (string)
                 The  specific server-side encryption mode that you want Elas-
                 tic Transcoder to use when decrypting your input files or en-
                 crypting  your  output files. Elastic Transcoder supports the

                   don't want to use the default key, you must add the AWS-KMS
                   key that you want to use to your pipeline.

                 o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A  padded  cipher-block  mode  of operation
                   originally used for HLS files.

                 o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                 o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation  that
                   is an authenticated encryption format, meaning that a file,
                   key, or initialization vector that has been  tampered  with
                   fails the decryption process.

                 For  all  three  AES  options, you must provide the following
                 settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                 o Key

                 o Key MD5

                 o Initialization Vector

                 WARNING:
                     For the AES modes, your private encryption keys and  your
                     unencrypted  data  are never stored by AWS; therefore, it
                     is important that you safely manage your encryption keys.
                     If  you  lose  them,  you won't be able to unencrypt your
                     data.

              Key -> (string)
                 The data encryption key that you want Elastic  Transcoder  to
                 use  to encrypt your output file, or that was used to encrypt
                 your input file. The key must be base64-encoded and  it  must
                 be  one  of the following bit lengths before being base64-en-
                 coded:
                     128 , 192 , or 256 .

                 The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon  Key  Man-
                 agement Service.

              KeyMd5 -> (string)
                 The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt your input
                 file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use  to  encrypt
                 your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a
                 checksum to make sure your key was not corrupted in  transit.
                 The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16
                 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              InitializationVector -> (string)
                 The series of random bits created by a random bit  generator,
                 unique  for  every encryption operation, that you used to en-
                 crypt your input files or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 use  to  encrypt your output files. The initialization vector
                 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes  long
                 before being base64-encoded.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Job -> (structure)
          A  section  of the response body that provides information about the
          job that is created.

          Id -> (string)
              The identifier that Elastic Transcoder assigned to the job.  You
              use this value to get settings for the job or to delete the job.

          Arn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the job.

          PipelineId -> (string)
              The  Id  of the pipeline that you want Elastic Transcoder to use
              for transcoding. The pipeline determines several  settings,  in-
              cluding  the Amazon S3 bucket from which Elastic Transcoder gets
              the files  to  transcode  and  the  bucket  into  which  Elastic
              Transcoder puts the transcoded files.

          Input -> (structure)
              A section of the request or response body that provides informa-
              tion about the file that is being transcoded.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the  body  of
                 the  JSON block is the the ID of the pipeline to use for pro-
                 cessing the job. The  InputBucket  object  in  that  pipeline
                 tells  Elastic  Transcoder  which Amazon S3 bucket to get the
                 file from.

                 If  the  file  name  includes  a  prefix,   such   as   cook-
                 ing/lasagna.mpg  , include the prefix in the key. If the file
                 isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns  an
                 error.

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 The  frame  rate  of  the  input  file.  If  you want Elastic
                 Transcoder to automatically detect the frame rate of the  in-
                 put  file,  specify  auto  . If you want to specify the frame
                 rate for the input file, enter one of the following values:
                     10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                 If you specify a value other than auto ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of the frame rate.

              Resolution -> (string)
                 This  value must be auto , which causes Elastic Transcoder to
                 automatically detect the resolution of the input file.

              AspectRatio -> (string)
                 The aspect ratio of the  input  file.  If  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to  automatically  detect the aspect ratio of the
                 input file, specify auto . If you want to specify the  aspect
                 ratio for the output file, enter one of the following values:
                     1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                 If  you  specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of the aspect ratio.

              Interlaced -> (string)
                 Whether the input file is interlaced.  If  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to automatically detect whether the input file is
                 interlaced, specify auto . If you want to specify whether the
                 input file is interlaced, enter one of the following values:
                     true , false

                 If  you  specify a value other than auto , Elastic Transcoder
                 disables automatic detection of interlacing.

              Container -> (string)
                 The container type for the input file. If  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to automatically detect the container type of the
                 input file, specify auto . If you want to  specify  the  con-
                 tainer  type  for  the input file, enter one of the following
                 values:
                     3gp , aac , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a , mkv  ,  mov  ,
                     mp3  , mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf , ogg , vob ,
                     wav , webm

              Encryption -> (structure)
                 The encryption settings, if any, that are used for decrypting
                 your  input  files. If your input file is encrypted, you must
                 specify the mode that Elastic Transcoder uses to decrypt your
                 file.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The  specific  server-side  encryption mode that you want
                     Elastic Transcoder to  use  when  decrypting  your  input
                     files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder
                     supports the following options:

                     o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for en-
                       crypting your files.

                     o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3 calls the Amazon Key Management
                       Service, which creates and manages the  keys  that  are
                       used   for   encrypting  your  files.  If  you  specify
                       s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use the  default  key,
                       you  must  add  the AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                       your pipeline.

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation
                       that is an  authenticated  encryption  format,  meaning
                       that  a  file,  key,  or initialization vector that has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     o Key

                     o Key MD5

                     o Initialization Vector

                     WARNING:
                        For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys and
                        your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;  there-
                        fore,  it is important that you safely manage your en-
                        cryption keys. If you lose them, you won't be able  to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  data encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder
                     to use to encrypt your output file, or that was  used  to
                     encrypt  your  input file. The key must be base64-encoded
                     and it must be one of the following  bit  lengths  before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The  key  must  also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  encrypt  your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest  as  a checksum to make sure your key was not cor-
                     rupted in transit. The key MD5  must  be  base64-encoded,
                     and  it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to encrypt your input files  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output files. The ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              TimeSpan -> (structure)
                 Settings for clipping an input. Each input can have different
                 clip settings.

                 StartTime -> (string)
                     The place in the input file where  you  want  a  clip  to
                     start.  The  format  can  be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum
                     value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a  second)  or
                     sssss.SSS  (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't spec-
                     ify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at  the  beginning
                     of the input file.

                 Duration -> (string)
                     The  duration  of  the  clip.  The  format  can be either
                     HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS  is  thou-
                     sandths   of  a  second)  or  sssss.SSS  (maximum  value:
                     86399.999).  If  you  don't  specify  a  value,   Elastic
                     Transcoder  creates  an output file from StartTime to the
                     end of the file.

                     If you specify a value longer than the  duration  of  the
                     input  file,  Elastic  Transcoder transcodes the file and
                     returns a warning message.

              InputCaptions -> (structure)
                 You can configure Elastic Transcoder to  transcode  captions,
                 or  subtitles,  from one format to another. All captions must
                 be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two  types  of  cap-
                 tions:

                 o Embedded:  Embedded  captions are included in the same file
                   as the audio and video. Elastic  Transcoder  supports  only
                   one  embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 em-
                   bedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values  include:
                   CEA-608  (EIA-608  , first non-empty channel only), CEA-708
                   (EIA-708 , first  non-empty  channel  only),  and  mov-text
                   Valid  outputs  include: mov-text   Elastic Transcoder sup-
                   ports a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                 o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a  separate  metadata
                   file  from  the  audio and video data. Sidecar captions re-
                   quire a player that is capable of understanding  the  rela-
                   tionship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elas-
                   tic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption  per  lan-
                   guage,  to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid
                   input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt
                   , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and we-
                   bvtt   Valid  outputs  include:  dfxp  (first  div  element
                   only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                 If  you  want  ttml  or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                 dfxp as your output format.

                 Elastic Transcoder does not support  OCR  (Optical  Character
                 Recognition),  does  not accept pictures as a valid input for
                 captions, and is not available  for  audio-only  transcoding.
                 Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for ex-
                 ample, italics) during the transcoding process.

                 To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set  Captions
                 to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
                 MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and  pass  in  a  null  Caption-
                 Sources array.

                 For  more  information  on  embedded files, see the Subtitles
                 Wikipedia page.

                 For more information on sidecar  files,  see  the  Extensible
                 Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles
                     the existence of multiple captions.

                     o MergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes  both  em-
                       bedded  and  sidecar captions into outputs. If captions
                       for a language are embedded in the input file and  also
                       appear  in  a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the
                       sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions  for
                       that language.

                     o MergeRetain:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embed-
                       ded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions  for
                       a  language are embedded in the input file and also ap-
                       pear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the em-
                       bedded  captions  and  ignores the sidecar captions for
                       that language.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty,  Elastic
                       Transcoder  omits  all sidecar captions from the output
                       files.

                     o Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the  side-
                       car captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                        MergePolicy cannot be null.

                 CaptionSources -> (list)
                     Source  files  for the input sidecar captions used during
                     the transcoding process. To omit  all  sidecar  captions,
                     leave CaptionSources blank.

                     (structure)
                        A source file for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The name of the sidecar caption file that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                        Language -> (string)
                            A  string  that specifies the language of the cap-
                            tion. If you specified multiple inputs  with  cap-
                            tions, the caption language must match in order to
                            be included in the output. Specify this as one of:

                            o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                            o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                            For more information on  ISO  language  codes  and
                            language names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                        TimeOffset -> (string)
                            For  clip generation or captions that do not start
                            at the same time as the associated video file, the
                            TimeOffset  tells  Elastic  Transcoder how much of
                            the video to encode before including captions.

                            Specify the TimeOffset in the form  [+-]SS.sss  or
                            [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                        Label -> (string)
                            The  label of the caption shown in the player when
                            choosing a language. We recommend that you put the
                            caption language name here, in the language of the
                            captions.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  Elastic
                            Transcoder  needs to decyrpt your caption sources,
                            or that you want Elastic Transcoder  to  apply  to
                            your caption sources.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The  specific  server-side encryption mode that
                               you want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  de-
                               crypting  your  input  files or encrypting your
                               output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                               following options:

                               o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates and manages the keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls  the  Amazon  Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the keys that are used  for  encrypting  your
                                 files.  If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and you
                                 don't want to use the default key,  you  must
                                 add  the  AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode  of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization vector that has  been  tampered  with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following settings, which  must  be  base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For  the AES modes, your private encryption
                                   keys and your unencrypted  data  are  never
                                   stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys.  If  you lose them, you won't be able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The data encryption key that you  want  Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file,
                               or that was used to encrypt  your  input  file.
                               The  key  must be base64-encoded and it must be
                               one of the following bit lengths  before  being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The  key  must  also  be encrypted by using the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file.
                               Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the  key digest as a
                               checksum to make sure your  key  was  not  cor-
                               rupted   in   transit.  The  key  MD5  must  be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The  series  of random bits created by a random
                               bit generator, unique for every encryption  op-
                               eration,  that  you  used to encrypt your input
                               files or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
                               use  to encrypt your output files. The initial-
                               ization vector must be base64-encoded,  and  it
                               must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long before being
                               base64-encoded.

              DetectedProperties -> (structure)
                 The detected properties of the input file.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     The detected height of the input file, in pixels.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     The detected frame rate of the input file, in frames  per
                     second.

                 FileSize -> (long)
                     The detected file size of the input file, in bytes.

                 DurationMillis -> (long)
                     The detected duration of the input file, in milliseconds.

          Inputs -> (list)
              Information  about  the  files  that  you're transcoding. If you
              specified  multiple  files  for  this  job,  Elastic  Transcoder
              stitches the files together to make one output.

              (structure)
                 Information about the file that you're transcoding.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  name of the file to transcode. Elsewhere in the body
                     of the JSON block is the the ID of the  pipeline  to  use
                     for  processing  the  job. The InputBucket object in that
                     pipeline tells Elastic Transcoder which Amazon S3  bucket
                     to get the file from.

                     If  the  file  name  includes  a  prefix,  such  as cook-
                     ing/lasagna.mpg , include the prefix in the key.  If  the
                     file  isn't  in  the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder
                     returns an error.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     The frame rate of the input file.  If  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to automatically detect the frame rate of the
                     input file, specify auto . If you  want  to  specify  the
                     frame rate for the input file, enter one of the following
                     values:
                        10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder  disables  automatic  detection  of  the frame
                     rate.

                 Resolution -> (string)
                     This value must be auto , which causes Elastic Transcoder
                     to automatically detect the resolution of the input file.

                 AspectRatio -> (string)
                     The  aspect  ratio of the input file. If you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to automatically detect the  aspect  ratio  of
                     the input file, specify auto . If you want to specify the
                     aspect ratio for the output file, enter one of  the  fol-
                     lowing values:
                        1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder disables automatic detection of the aspect ra-
                     tio.

                 Interlaced -> (string)
                     Whether the input file is interlaced. If you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to automatically detect whether the input file
                     is  interlaced,  specify  auto  .  If you want to specify
                     whether the input file is interlaced, enter  one  of  the
                     following values:
                        true , false

                     If  you  specify  a  value  other  than  auto  ,  Elastic
                     Transcoder disables automatic detection of interlacing.

                 Container -> (string)
                     The container type for the input file. If you want  Elas-
                     tic Transcoder to automatically detect the container type
                     of the input file, specify auto . If you want to  specify
                     the  container  type for the input file, enter one of the
                     following values:
                        3gp , aac , asf , avi , divx , flv , m4a , mkv , mov ,
                        mp3 , mp4 , mpeg , mpeg-ps , mpeg-ts , mxf , ogg , vob
                        , wav , webm

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The encryption settings, if any, that are  used  for  de-
                     crypting  your  input  files.  If  your input file is en-
                     crypted,  you  must  specify  the   mode   that   Elastic
                     Transcoder uses to decrypt your file.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting  your  input
                        files   or   encrypting  your  output  files.  Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used  for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3 calls the Amazon Key Manage-
                          ment Service, which creates  and  manages  the  keys
                          that  are  used  for  encrypting  your files. If you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use the de-
                          fault  key,  you  must  add the AWS-KMS key that you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of opera-
                          tion that is  an  authenticated  encryption  format,
                          meaning  that  a file, key, or initialization vector
                          that has been tampered  with  fails  the  decryption
                          process.

                        For  all  three AES options, you must provide the fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For the AES modes, your  private  encryption  keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore, it is important that you safely  manage
                            your  encryption keys. If you lose them, you won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  data  encryption  key  that  you   want   Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was used to encrypt your input file. The key  must  be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The  MD5  digest  of  the key that you used to encrypt
                        your input file, or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses the key digest as a checksum to  make  sure  your
                        key  was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16  bytes  long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator, unique for every  encryption  operation,  that
                        you  used to encrypt your input files or that you want
                        Elastic Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your  output
                        files.  The  initialization  vector must be base64-en-
                        coded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before be-
                        ing base64-encoded.

                 TimeSpan -> (structure)
                     Settings  for clipping an input. Each input can have dif-
                     ferent clip settings.

                     StartTime -> (string)
                        The place in the input file where you want a  clip  to
                        start.  The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum
                        value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of  a  second)
                        or  sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't
                        specify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the  be-
                        ginning of the input file.

                     Duration -> (string)
                        The  duration  of  the  clip. The format can be either
                        HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999;  SSS  is
                        thousandths  of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value:
                        86399.999). If you  don't  specify  a  value,  Elastic
                        Transcoder  creates  an  output file from StartTime to
                        the end of the file.

                        If you specify a value longer than the duration of the
                        input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and
                        returns a warning message.

                 InputCaptions -> (structure)
                     You can configure Elastic Transcoder  to  transcode  cap-
                     tions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All cap-
                     tions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder  supports  two
                     types of captions:

                     o Embedded:  Embedded  captions  are included in the same
                       file as the audio and video.  Elastic  Transcoder  sup-
                       ports only one embedded caption per language, to a max-
                       imum of 300 embedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input
                       values  include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first non-empty
                       channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty chan-
                       nel   only),  and  mov-text    Valid  outputs  include:
                       mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one
                       embedded format per output.

                     o Sidecar:  Sidecar captions are kept in a separate meta-
                       data file from the audio and video data.  Sidecar  cap-
                       tions require a player that is capable of understanding
                       the relationship between the video file and the sidecar
                       file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar cap-
                       tion per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar  captions
                       per  file.  Valid input values include: dfxp (first div
                       element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml  (first
                       div  element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs include:
                       dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                     If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                     dfxp as your output format.

                     Elastic  Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Charac-
                     ter Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid in-
                     put  for  captions,  and  is not available for audio-only
                     transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does  not  preserve  text
                     formatting  (for example, italics) during the transcoding
                     process.

                     To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set  Cap-
                     tions  to  null.  To  pass  through existing captions un-
                     changed, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass in
                     a null CaptionSources array.

                     For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles
                     Wikipedia page.

                     For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible
                     Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder han-
                        dles the existence of multiple captions.

                        o MergeOverride: Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes  both
                          embedded  and sidecar captions into outputs. If cap-
                          tions for a language are embedded in the input  file
                          and   also   appear   in  a  sidecar  file,  Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the
                          embedded captions for that language.

                        o MergeRetain:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both em-
                          bedded and sidecar captions into  outputs.  If  cap-
                          tions  for a language are embedded in the input file
                          and  also  appear  in  a   sidecar   file,   Elastic
                          Transcoder  uses  the  embedded captions and ignores
                          the sidecar captions for that language. If  Caption-
                          Sources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all side-
                          car captions from the output files.

                        o Override: Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes  only  the
                          sidecar  captions that you specify in CaptionSources
                          .
                            MergePolicy cannot be null.

                     CaptionSources -> (list)
                        Source files for the input sidecar captions used  dur-
                        ing  the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar cap-
                        tions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                        (structure)
                            A source file for the input sidecar captions  used
                            during the transcoding process.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  name  of the sidecar caption file that you
                               want Elastic Transcoder to include in the  out-
                               put file.

                            Language -> (string)
                               A  string  that  specifies  the language of the
                               caption. If you specified multiple inputs  with
                               captions,  the  caption  language must match in
                               order to be included  in  the  output.  Specify
                               this as one of:

                               o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                            TimeOffset -> (string)
                               For  clip  generation  or  captions that do not
                               start at the same time as the associated  video
                               file,  the  TimeOffset tells Elastic Transcoder
                               how much of the video to encode before  includ-
                               ing captions.

                               Specify  the  TimeOffset in the form [+-]SS.sss
                               or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                            Label -> (string)
                               The label of the caption shown  in  the  player
                               when choosing a language. We recommend that you
                               put the caption language name here, in the lan-
                               guage of the captions.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The  encryption  settings, if any, that Elastic
                               Transcoder  needs  to  decyrpt   your   caption
                               sources, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               apply to your caption sources.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The specific  server-side  encryption  mode
                                   that  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder to use
                                   when decrypting your  input  files  or  en-
                                   crypting   your   output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3: Amazon S3  creates  and  manages  the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages  the  keys  that are used for en-
                                     crypting  your  files.  If  you   specify
                                     s3-aws-kms  and you don't want to use the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode
                                     of operation that is an authenticated en-
                                     cryption  format,  meaning  that  a file,
                                     key, or initialization  vector  that  has
                                     been  tampered  with fails the decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the   following  settings,  which  must  be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                   WARNING:
                                      For the AES modes, your private  encryp-
                                      tion  keys and your unencrypted data are
                                      never stored by AWS;  therefore,  it  is
                                      important  that  you  safely manage your
                                      encryption keys. If you lose  them,  you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic Transcoder to use to encrypt your  out-
                                   put  file, or that was used to encrypt your
                                   input file. The key must be  base64-encoded
                                   and  it  must  be  one of the following bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The  MD5 digest of the key that you used to
                                   encrypt your input file, or that  you  want
                                   Elastic  Transcoder  to use to encrypt your
                                   output file. Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the
                                   key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                                   key was not corrupted in transit.  The  key
                                   MD5  must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                                   exactly  16   bytes   long   before   being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion  operation,  that  you used to encrypt
                                   your input files or that you  want  Elastic
                                   Transcoder  to  use  to encrypt your output
                                   files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                                   base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 DetectedProperties -> (structure)
                     The detected properties of the input file.

                     Width -> (integer)
                        The detected width of the input file, in pixels.

                     Height -> (integer)
                        The detected height of the input file, in pixels.

                     FrameRate -> (string)
                        The detected frame rate of the input file,  in  frames
                        per second.

                     FileSize -> (long)
                        The detected file size of the input file, in bytes.

                     DurationMillis -> (long)
                        The  detected duration of the input file, in millisec-
                        onds.

          Output -> (structure)
              If you specified one output for a job,  information  about  that
              output.  If you specified multiple outputs for a job, the Output
              object lists information about the first output. This duplicates
              the  information that is listed for the first output in the Out-
              puts object.

              WARNING:
                 Outputs recommended instead.

              A section of the request or response body that provides informa-
              tion about the transcoded (target) file.

              Id -> (string)
                 A  sequential  counter,  starting  with 1, that identifies an
                 output among the outputs from the current job. In the  Output
                 syntax, this value is always 1.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name to assign to the transcoded file. Elastic Transcoder
                 saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket specified by the  Out-
                 putBucket  object  in  the  pipeline that is specified by the
                 pipeline ID.

              ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
                 Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails  for
                 your  videos  and,  if so, how you want Elastic Transcoder to
                 name the files.

                 If you don't want Elastic Transcoder  to  create  thumbnails,
                 specify "".

                 If you do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails, spec-
                 ify the information that you want to include in the file name
                 for  each  thumbnail. You can specify the following values in
                 any sequence:

                 o ``{count}`` (Required) : If you want to create  thumbnails,
                   you  must  include  {count} in the ThumbnailPattern object.
                   Wherever you specify {count} , Elastic  Transcoder  adds  a
                   five-digit  sequence  number  (beginning  with  00001  ) to
                   thumbnail file names. The number indicates  where  a  given
                   thumbnail  appears  in  the  sequence  of  thumbnails for a
                   transcoded file.

                 WARNING:
                     If you specify a literal value  and/or  {resolution}  but
                     you  omit  {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns a valida-
                     tion error and does not create the job.

                 o Literal values (Optional) : You can specify literal  values
                   anywhere  in  the ThumbnailPattern object. For example, you
                   can include them as a file name prefix or  as  a  delimiter
                   between {resolution} and {count} .

                 o ``{resolution}``   (Optional)   :   If   you  want  Elastic
                   Transcoder to include the resolution in the file name,  in-
                   clude {resolution} in the ThumbnailPattern object.

                 When  creating  thumbnails,  Elastic Transcoder automatically
                 saves the files in the format (.jpg or .png) that appears  in
                 the  preset  that you specified in the PresetID value of Cre-
                 ateJobOutput . Elastic Transcoder also appends the applicable
                 file name extension.

              ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
                 The  encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  you  want Elastic
                 Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

                 Mode -> (string)
                     The specific server-side encryption mode  that  you  want
                     Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting your input
                     files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder
                     supports the following options:

                     o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for en-
                       crypting your files.

                     o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Management
                       Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys that are
                       used  for  encrypting  your  files.  If   you   specify
                       s3-aws-kms  and  you don't want to use the default key,
                       you must add the AWS-KMS key that you want  to  use  to
                       your pipeline.

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  operation
                       that  is  an  authenticated  encryption format, meaning
                       that a file, key, or  initialization  vector  that  has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     o Key

                     o Key MD5

                     o Initialization Vector

                     WARNING:
                        For the AES modes, your private  encryption  keys  and
                        your  unencrypted data are never stored by AWS; there-
                        fore, it is important that you safely manage your  en-
                        cryption  keys. If you lose them, you won't be able to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The data encryption key that you want Elastic  Transcoder
                     to  use  to encrypt your output file, or that was used to
                     encrypt your input file. The key must  be  base64-encoded
                     and  it  must  be one of the following bit lengths before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The key must also be encrypted by using  the  Amazon  Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The  MD5  digest of the key that you used to encrypt your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest as a checksum to make sure your key was  not  cor-
                     rupted  in  transit.  The key MD5 must be base64-encoded,
                     and it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to  encrypt  your  input  files  or that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to use to encrypt your output files. The  ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              Rotate -> (string)
                 The number of degrees clockwise by  which  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder  to rotate the output relative to the input. Enter
                 one of the following values:
                     auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270

                 The value auto generally works only if the file  that  you're
                 transcoding contains rotation metadata.

              PresetId -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the Id object for the preset that you want to
                 use for this job. The preset determines the audio, video, and
                 thumbnail settings that Elastic Transcoder uses for transcod-
                 ing. To use a preset that you created, specify the preset  ID
                 that  Elastic  Transcoder  returned  in the response when you
                 created the preset. You can also use the  Elastic  Transcoder
                 system presets, which you can get with ListPresets .

              SegmentDuration -> (string)

                 WARNING:
                     (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

                 If  you  specify  a preset in PresetId for which the value of
                 Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS),  Segment-
                 Duration  is  the  target maximum duration of each segment in
                 seconds. For HLSv3 format playlists, each  media  segment  is
                 stored  in  a  separate .ts file. For HLSv4 , MPEG-DASH , and
                 Smooth playlists, all media segments for an output are stored
                 in a single file. Each segment is approximately the length of
                 the SegmentDuration , though  individual  segments  might  be
                 shorter or longer.

                 The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration
                 of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration , the
                 duration  of  the  last  segment  is  the  remainder of total
                 length/SegmentDuration.

                 Elastic Transcoder creates an  output-specific  playlist  for
                 each output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add
                 an output to the master playlist for this job, include it  in
                 the OutputKeys of the associated playlist.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status of one output in a job. If you specified only one
                 output for the job, Outputs:Status  is  always  the  same  as
                 Job:Status . If you specified more than one output:

                 o Job:Status  and  Outputs:Status  for  all of the outputs is
                   Submitted until Elastic Transcoder starts  to  process  the
                   first output.

                 o When Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first output,
                   Outputs:Status for that output and Job:Status  both  change
                   to  Progressing. For each output, the value of Outputs:Sta-
                   tus remains Submitted until Elastic  Transcoder  starts  to
                   process the output.

                 o Job:Status  remains  Progressing  until  all of the outputs
                   reach a terminal status, either Complete or Error.

                 o When all of the outputs reach a terminal status, Job:Status
                   changes  to  Complete only if Outputs:Status for all of the
                   outputs is Complete . If Outputs:Status  for  one  or  more
                   outputs  is  Error  , the terminal status for Job:Status is
                   also Error .

                 The value of Status is one of the following: Submitted , Pro-
                 gressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .

              StatusDetail -> (string)
                 Information that further explains Status .

              Duration -> (long)
                 Duration of the output file, in seconds.

              Width -> (integer)
                 Specifies the width of the output file in pixels.

              Height -> (integer)
                 Height of the output file, in pixels.

              FrameRate -> (string)
                 Frame rate of the output file, in frames per second.

              FileSize -> (long)
                 File size of the output file, in bytes.

              DurationMillis -> (long)
                 Duration of the output file, in milliseconds.

              Watermarks -> (list)
                 Information  about  the  watermarks  that  you  want  Elastic
                 Transcoder to add to the video during  transcoding.  You  can
                 specify  up  to four watermarks for each output. Settings for
                 each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify
                 in Preset for the current output.

                 Watermarks  are  added to the output video in the sequence in
                 which you list them in the job outputthe first  watermark  in
                 the  list  is added to the output video first, the second wa-
                 termark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if
                 the  settings  in  a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place
                 all watermarks in the same  location,  the  second  watermark
                 that  you  add covers the first one, the third one covers the
                 second, and the fourth one covers the third.

                 (structure)
                     Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want  to
                     display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png
                     format, which supports transparency.

                     PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                        The  ID  of  the  watermark  settings   that   Elastic
                        Transcoder  uses to add watermarks to the video during
                        transcoding. The settings are in the preset  specified
                        by  Preset for the current output. In that preset, the
                        value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder  which
                        settings to use.

                     InputKey -> (string)
                        The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use
                        for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket
                        contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks
                        the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input  Bucket
                        object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                        If  the  file name includes a prefix, for example, lo-
                        gos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key. If the
                        file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic Transcoder
                        returns an error.

                     Encryption -> (structure)
                        The encryption settings, if any, that you want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                        Mode -> (string)
                            The  specific server-side encryption mode that you
                            want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  decrypting
                            your  input files or encrypting your output files.
                            Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:

                            o s3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys  used
                              for encrypting your files.

                            o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Man-
                              agement Service, which creates and  manages  the
                              keys that are used for encrypting your files. If
                              you specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use
                              the  default  key,  you must add the AWS-KMS key
                              that you want to use to your pipeline.

                            o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of op-
                              eration originally used for HLS files.

                            o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                            o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of op-
                              eration that is an authenticated encryption for-
                              mat, meaning that a file, key, or initialization
                              vector that has been tampered with fails the de-
                              cryption process.

                            For  all  three  AES options, you must provide the
                            following settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                            o Key

                            o Key MD5

                            o Initialization Vector

                            WARNING:
                               For the AES modes, your private encryption keys
                               and  your  unencrypted data are never stored by
                               AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely
                               manage  your encryption keys. If you lose them,
                               you won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The data encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                            Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file, or
                            that was used to encrypt your input file. The  key
                            must  be  base64-encoded and it must be one of the
                            following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:
                               128 , 192 , or 256 .

                            The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon
                            Key Management Service.

                        KeyMd5 -> (string)
                            The MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt
                            your  input  file,  or  that  you   want   Elastic
                            Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt your output file.
                            Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a check-
                            sum  to  make  sure  your key was not corrupted in
                            transit. The key MD5 must be  base64-encoded,  and
                            it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes long before being
                            base64-encoded.

                        InitializationVector -> (string)
                            The series of random bits created by a random  bit
                            generator,  unique for every encryption operation,
                            that you used to encrypt your input files or  that
                            you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your
                            output files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                            base64-encoded,  and  it  must be exactly 16 bytes
                            long before being base64-encoded.

              AlbumArt -> (structure)
                 The album art to be associated with the output file, if any.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  handles
                     the existence of multiple album artwork files.

                     o Replace:  The specified album art replaces any existing
                       album art.

                     o Prepend: The specified album art is placed in front  of
                       any existing album art.

                     o Append: The specified album art is placed after any ex-
                       isting album art.

                     o Fallback: If the original input file contains  artwork,
                       Elastic Transcoder uses that artwork for the output. If
                       the original input does not  contain  artwork,  Elastic
                       Transcoder uses the specified album art file.

                 Artwork -> (list)
                     The  file  to be used as album art. There can be multiple
                     artworks associated with an audio file, to a  maximum  of
                     20. Valid formats are .jpg and .png

                     (structure)
                        The  file to be used as album art. There can be multi-
                        ple artworks associated with an audio file, to a maxi-
                        mum of 20.

                        To  remove artwork or leave the artwork empty, you can
                        either set Artwork to null, or set the Merge Policy to
                        "Replace" and use an empty Artwork array.

                        To  pass  through  existing artwork unchanged, set the
                        Merge Policy to "Prepend",  "Append",  or  "Fallback",
                        and use an empty Artwork array.

                        InputKey -> (string)
                            The  name  of the file to be used as album art. To
                            determine which  Amazon  S3  bucket  contains  the
                            specified  file,  Elastic  Transcoder  checks  the
                            pipeline specified by PipelineId ; the InputBucket
                            object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.

                            If  the  file name includes a prefix, for example,
                            cooking/pie.jpg , include the prefix in  the  key.
                            If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic
                            Transcoder returns an error.

                        MaxWidth -> (string)
                            The maximum width of the output album art in  pix-
                            els. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses
                            600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric
                            value,  enter an even integer between 32 and 4096,
                            inclusive.

                        MaxHeight -> (string)
                            The maximum height of the output album art in pix-
                            els. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses
                            600 as the default value. If you specify a numeric
                            value,  enter an even integer between 32 and 3072,
                            inclusive.

                        SizingPolicy -> (string)
                            Specify one of the  following  values  to  control
                            scaling of the output album art:

                            o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art so
                              it matches the value that you specified  in  ei-
                              ther MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceeding the
                              other value.

                            o Fill: Elastic Transcoder scales the  output  art
                              so  it  matches  the value that you specified in
                              either MaxWidth or MaxHeight and matches or  ex-
                              ceeds  the  other value. Elastic Transcoder cen-
                              ters the output art and then crops it in the di-
                              mension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.

                            o Stretch: Elastic Transcoder stretches the output
                              art to match the values that you  specified  for
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight . If the relative propor-
                              tions of the input art and the  output  art  are
                              different, the output art will be distorted.

                            o Keep: Elastic Transcoder does not scale the out-
                              put art. If either dimension of  the  input  art
                              exceeds   the  values  that  you  specified  for

                              crops the output art.

                            o ShrinkToFit:  Elastic Transcoder scales the out-

                              values  that  you  specified for at least one of
                              MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding  either
                              value.  If  you  specify  this  option,  Elastic
                              Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                            o ShrinkToFill Elastic Transcoder scales the  out-
                              put  art  down  so that its dimensions match the
                              values that you specified for at  least  one  of

                              either value. If you specify this option,  Elas-
                              tic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                        PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                            When  you  set  PaddingPolicy  to  Pad  ,  Elastic
                            Transcoder may add white bars to the top and  bot-
                            tom  and/or left and right sides of the output al-
                            bum art to make the total size of the  output  art
                            match  the  values that you specified for MaxWidth
                            and MaxHeight .

                        AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                            The format of album art, if any. Valid formats are
                            .jpg and .png .

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The  encryption  settings,  if  any, that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to apply to your artwork.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use when de-
                               crypting your input files  or  encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization  vector  that  has been tampered with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following  settings,  which  must be base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For the AES modes, your private  encryption
                                   keys  and  your  unencrypted data are never
                                   stored by AWS; therefore, it  is  important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys. If you lose them, you won't  be  able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The  data  encryption key that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file,
                               or  that  was  used to encrypt your input file.
                               The key must be base64-encoded and it  must  be
                               one  of  the following bit lengths before being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The key must also be  encrypted  by  using  the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The  MD5 digest of the key that you used to en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file.
                               Elastic Transcoder uses the  key  digest  as  a
                               checksum  to  make  sure  your key was not cor-
                               rupted  in  transit.  The  key  MD5   must   be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The series of random bits created by  a  random
                               bit  generator, unique for every encryption op-
                               eration, that you used to  encrypt  your  input
                               files  or  that  you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               use to encrypt your output files. The  initial-
                               ization  vector  must be base64-encoded, and it
                               must be exactly  16  bytes  long  before  being
                               base64-encoded.

              Composition -> (list)
                 You  can  create an output file that contains an excerpt from
                 the input file. This excerpt, called a clip,  can  come  from
                 the  beginning,  middle,  or end of the file. The Composition
                 object contains settings for the clips that make up an output
                 file.  For the current release, you can only specify settings
                 for a single clip per output  file.  The  Composition  object
                 cannot be null.

                 (structure)
                     Settings  for  one  clip  in a composition. All jobs in a
                     playlist must have the same clip settings.

                     TimeSpan -> (structure)
                        Settings that determine when a  clip  begins  and  how
                        long it lasts.

                        StartTime -> (string)
                            The  place in the input file where you want a clip
                            to start. The format can  be  either  HH:mm:ss.SSS
                            (maximum  value:  23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths
                            of  a  second)  or   sssss.SSS   (maximum   value:
                            86399.999).  If you don't specify a value, Elastic
                            Transcoder starts at the beginning  of  the  input
                            file.

                        Duration -> (string)
                            The duration of the clip. The format can be either
                            HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS  is
                            thousandths  of  a  second)  or sssss.SSS (maximum
                            value: 86399.999). If you don't specify  a  value,
                            Elastic  Transcoder  creates  an  output file from
                            StartTime to the end of the file.

                            If you specify a value longer than the duration of
                            the  input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the
                            file and returns a warning message.

              Captions -> (structure)
                 You can configure Elastic Transcoder to  transcode  captions,
                 or  subtitles,  from one format to another. All captions must
                 be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two  types  of  cap-
                 tions:

                 o Embedded:  Embedded  captions are included in the same file
                   as the audio and video. Elastic  Transcoder  supports  only
                   one  embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 em-
                   bedded captions  per  file.  Valid  input  values  include:
                   CEA-608  (EIA-608  , first non-empty channel only), CEA-708
                   (EIA-708 , first  non-empty  channel  only),  and  mov-text
                   Valid  outputs  include: mov-text   Elastic Transcoder sup-
                   ports a maximum of one embedded format per output.

                 o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a  separate  metadata
                   file  from  the  audio and video data. Sidecar captions re-
                   quire a player that is capable of understanding  the  rela-
                   tionship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elas-
                   tic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption  per  lan-
                   guage,  to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid
                   input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt
                   , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and we-
                   bvtt   Valid  outputs  include:  dfxp  (first  div  element
                   only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                 If  you  want  ttml  or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                 dfxp as your output format.

                 Elastic Transcoder does not support  OCR  (Optical  Character
                 Recognition),  does  not accept pictures as a valid input for
                 captions, and is not available  for  audio-only  transcoding.
                 Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for ex-
                 ample, italics) during the transcoding process.

                 To remove captions or leave the captions empty, set  Captions
                 to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the
                 MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and  pass  in  a  null  Caption-
                 Sources array.

                 For  more  information  on  embedded files, see the Subtitles
                 Wikipedia page.

                 For more information on sidecar  files,  see  the  Extensible
                 Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                 MergePolicy -> (string)
                     A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles
                     the existence of multiple captions.

                     o MergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes  both  em-
                       bedded  and  sidecar captions into outputs. If captions
                       for a language are embedded in the input file and  also
                       appear  in  a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the
                       sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions  for
                       that language.

                     o MergeRetain:  Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embed-
                       ded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions  for
                       a  language are embedded in the input file and also ap-
                       pear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the em-
                       bedded  captions  and  ignores the sidecar captions for
                       that language.  If  CaptionSources  is  empty,  Elastic
                       Transcoder  omits  all sidecar captions from the output
                       files.

                     o Override: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the  side-
                       car captions that you specify in CaptionSources .
                        MergePolicy cannot be null.

                 CaptionSources -> (list)
                     Source  files  for the input sidecar captions used during
                     the transcoding process. To omit  all  sidecar  captions,
                     leave CaptionSources blank.

                     (structure)
                        A source file for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The name of the sidecar caption file that you want
                            Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.

                        Language -> (string)
                            A  string  that specifies the language of the cap-
                            tion. If you specified multiple inputs  with  cap-
                            tions, the caption language must match in order to
                            be included in the output. Specify this as one of:

                            o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                            o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                            For more information on  ISO  language  codes  and
                            language names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.

                        TimeOffset -> (string)
                            For  clip generation or captions that do not start
                            at the same time as the associated video file, the
                            TimeOffset  tells  Elastic  Transcoder how much of
                            the video to encode before including captions.

                            Specify the TimeOffset in the form  [+-]SS.sss  or
                            [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.

                        Label -> (string)
                            The  label of the caption shown in the player when
                            choosing a language. We recommend that you put the
                            caption language name here, in the language of the
                            captions.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption  settings,  if  any,  that  Elastic
                            Transcoder  needs to decyrpt your caption sources,
                            or that you want Elastic Transcoder  to  apply  to
                            your caption sources.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The  specific  server-side encryption mode that
                               you want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  de-
                               crypting  your  input  files or encrypting your
                               output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                               following options:

                               o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates and manages the keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls  the  Amazon  Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the keys that are used  for  encrypting  your
                                 files.  If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and you
                                 don't want to use the default key,  you  must
                                 add  the  AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode  of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization vector that has  been  tampered  with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following settings, which  must  be  base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For  the AES modes, your private encryption
                                   keys and your unencrypted  data  are  never
                                   stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys.  If  you lose them, you won't be able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The data encryption key that you  want  Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file,
                               or that was used to encrypt  your  input  file.
                               The  key  must be base64-encoded and it must be
                               one of the following bit lengths  before  being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The  key  must  also  be encrypted by using the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file.
                               Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the  key digest as a
                               checksum to make sure your  key  was  not  cor-
                               rupted   in   transit.  The  key  MD5  must  be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The  series  of random bits created by a random
                               bit generator, unique for every encryption  op-
                               eration,  that  you  used to encrypt your input
                               files or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
                               use  to encrypt your output files. The initial-
                               ization vector must be base64-encoded,  and  it
                               must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long before being
                               base64-encoded.

                 CaptionFormats -> (list)
                     The array of file formats for the output captions. If you
                     leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an er-
                     ror.

                     (structure)
                        The file format of the output captions. If  you  leave
                        this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                        Format -> (string)
                            The  format you specify determines whether Elastic
                            Transcoder generates an embedded or  sidecar  cap-
                            tion for this output.

                            o Valid Embedded Caption Formats:

                              o for FLAC : None

                              o For MP3 : None

                              o For MP4 : mov-text

                              o For MPEG-TS : None

                              o For ogg : None

                              o For webm : None

                            o Valid    Sidecar    Caption   Formats:   Elastic
                              Transcoder  supports  dfxp  (first  div  element
                              only), scc, srt, and webvtt. If you want ttml or
                              smpte-tt compatible captions,  specify  dfxp  as
                              your output format.

                              o For FMP4 : dfxp

                              o Non-FMP4 outputs : All sidecar types
                               fmp4 captions have an extension of .ismt

                        Pattern -> (string)
                            The  prefix for caption filenames, in the form de-
                            scription -{language} , where:

                            o description is a description of the video.

                            o {language}  is  a  literal  value  that  Elastic
                              Transcoder  replaces with the two- or three-let-
                              ter code for the language of the caption in  the
                              output file names.

                            If  you  don't include {language} in the file name
                            pattern, Elastic Transcoder automatically  appends
                            "{language}  "  to  the value that you specify for
                            the description. In addition,  Elastic  Transcoder
                            automatically  appends the count to the end of the
                            segment files.

                            For example, suppose you're transcoding  into  srt
                            format.  When  you  enter  "Sydney-{language}-sun-
                            rise", and the language of the captions is English
                            (en),  the  name  of  the first caption file is be
                            Sydney-en-sunrise00000.srt.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings, if  any,  that  you  want
                            Elastic  Transcoder  to apply to your caption for-
                            mats.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The specific server-side encryption  mode  that
                               you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use when de-
                               crypting your input files  or  encrypting  your
                               output  files.  Elastic Transcoder supports the
                               following options:

                               o s3: Amazon S3 creates and  manages  the  keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms:  Amazon  S3  calls the Amazon Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the  keys  that  are used for encrypting your
                                 files. If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and  you
                                 don't  want  to use the default key, you must
                                 add the AWS-KMS key that you want to  use  to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode  of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-

                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following  settings,  which  must be base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                     o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of  operation
                       originally used for HLS files.

                     o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                     o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation
                       that is an  authenticated  encryption  format,  meaning
                       that  a  file,  key,  or initialization vector that has
                       been tampered with fails the decryption process.

                     For all three AES options, you must provide the following
                     settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                     o Key

                     o Key MD5

                     o Initialization Vector

                     WARNING:
                        For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys and
                        your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;  there-
                        fore,  it is important that you safely manage your en-
                        cryption keys. If you lose them, you won't be able  to
                        unencrypt your data.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  data encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder
                     to use to encrypt your output file, or that was  used  to
                     encrypt  your  input file. The key must be base64-encoded
                     and it must be one of the following  bit  lengths  before
                     being base64-encoded:
                        128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     The  key  must  also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                     Management Service.

                 KeyMd5 -> (string)
                     The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  encrypt  your
                     input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to
                     encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key
                     digest  as  a checksum to make sure your key was not cor-
                     rupted in transit. The key MD5  must  be  base64-encoded,
                     and  it  must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long  before being
                     base64-encoded.

                 InitializationVector -> (string)
                     The series of random bits created by a random bit genera-
                     tor, unique for every encryption operation, that you used
                     to encrypt your input files  or  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output files. The ini-
                     tialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                     exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.

              AppliedColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                 If  Elastic Transcoder used a preset with a ColorSpaceConver-
                 sionMode to transcode the output file, the AppliedColorSpace-
                 Conversion  parameter  shows  the conversion used. If no Col-
                 orSpaceConversionMode was defined in the preset, this parame-
                 ter is not be included in the job response.

          Outputs -> (list)
              Information  about  the  output files. We recommend that you use
              the Outputs syntax for all jobs,  even  when  you  want  Elastic
              Transcoder  to transcode a file into only one format. Do not use
              both the Outputs and Output syntaxes in the  same  request.  You
              can create a maximum of 30 outputs per job.

              If  you  specify  more  than  one  output  for  a  job,  Elastic
              Transcoder creates the files for each output  in  the  order  in
              which you specify them in the job.

              (structure)

                 WARNING:
                     Outputs recommended instead.

                 If you specified one output for a job, information about that
                 output. If you specified multiple outputs for a job, the Out-
                 put object lists information about the first output. This du-
                 plicates the information that is listed for the first  output
                 in the Outputs object.

                 Id -> (string)
                     A sequential counter, starting with 1, that identifies an
                     output among the outputs from the  current  job.  In  the
                     Output syntax, this value is always 1.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  name  to  assign  to  the  transcoded  file. Elastic
                     Transcoder saves the file in the Amazon S3 bucket  speci-
                     fied  by  the OutputBucket object in the pipeline that is
                     specified by the pipeline ID.

                 ThumbnailPattern -> (string)
                     Whether you want Elastic Transcoder to create  thumbnails
                     for  your  videos  and,  if  so,  how  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to name the files.

                     If you don't want Elastic  Transcoder  to  create  thumb-
                     nails, specify "".

                     If  you  do want Elastic Transcoder to create thumbnails,
                     specify the information that you want to include  in  the
                     file name for each thumbnail. You can specify the follow-
                     ing values in any sequence:

                     o ``{count}`` (Required) : If you want to  create  thumb-
                       nails, you must include {count} in the ThumbnailPattern
                       object.  Wherever  you  specify   {count}   ,   Elastic
                       Transcoder adds a five-digit sequence number (beginning
                       with 00001 ) to thumbnail file names. The number  indi-
                       cates  where  a given thumbnail appears in the sequence
                       of thumbnails for a transcoded file.

                     WARNING:
                        If you specify a literal value and/or {resolution} but
                        you  omit {count} , Elastic Transcoder returns a vali-
                        dation error and does not create the job.

                     o Literal values (Optional) :  You  can  specify  literal
                       values anywhere in the ThumbnailPattern object. For ex-
                       ample, you can include them as a file name prefix or as
                       a delimiter between {resolution} and {count} .

                     o ``{resolution}``  (Optional)  :  If  you  want  Elastic
                       Transcoder to include the resolution in the file  name,
                       include {resolution} in the ThumbnailPattern object.

                     When  creating  thumbnails,  Elastic Transcoder automati-
                     cally saves the files in the format (.jpg or  .png)  that
                     appears  in the preset that you specified in the PresetID
                     value of CreateJobOutput . Elastic  Transcoder  also  ap-
                     pends the applicable file name extension.

                 ThumbnailEncryption -> (structure)
                     The  encryption  settings,  if any, that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to apply to your thumbnail.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to use when decrypting your input
                        files  or  encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Manage-
                          ment  Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys
                          that are used for  encrypting  your  files.  If  you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use the de-
                          fault key, you must add the  AWS-KMS  key  that  you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  opera-
                          tion  that  is  an  authenticated encryption format,
                          meaning that a file, key, or  initialization  vector
                          that  has  been  tampered  with fails the decryption
                          process.

                        For all three AES options, you must provide  the  fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore,  it is important that you safely manage
                            your encryption keys. If you lose them, you  won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The   data   encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was  used  to encrypt your input file. The key must be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The MD5 digest of the key that  you  used  to  encrypt
                        your  input  file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses  the  key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                        key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must  be
                        base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16 bytes long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator,  unique  for  every encryption operation, that
                        you used to encrypt your input files or that you  want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your output
                        files. The initialization vector  must  be  base64-en-
                        coded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before be-
                        ing base64-encoded.

                 Rotate -> (string)
                     The number of degrees clockwise by which you want Elastic
                     Transcoder  to  rotate  the output relative to the input.
                     Enter one of the following values:
                        auto , 0 , 90 , 180 , 270

                     The value auto generally works  only  if  the  file  that
                     you're transcoding contains rotation metadata.

                 PresetId -> (string)
                     The  value  of the Id object for the preset that you want
                     to use for this job. The  preset  determines  the  audio,
                     video,  and  thumbnail  settings  that Elastic Transcoder
                     uses for transcoding. To use a preset that  you  created,
                     specify the preset ID that Elastic Transcoder returned in
                     the response when you created the preset.  You  can  also
                     use  the Elastic Transcoder system presets, which you can
                     get with ListPresets .

                 SegmentDuration -> (string)

                     WARNING:
                        (Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

                     If you specify a preset in PresetId for which  the  value
                     of  Container  is  fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS),
                     SegmentDuration is the target maximum  duration  of  each
                     segment  in seconds. For HLSv3 format playlists, each me-
                     dia segment is stored in a separate .ts file. For HLSv4 ,
                     MPEG-DASH  , and Smooth playlists, all media segments for
                     an output are stored in a single file.  Each  segment  is
                     approximately  the length of the SegmentDuration , though
                     individual segments might be shorter or longer.

                     The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the  du-
                     ration of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDu-
                     ration , the duration of the last segment is the  remain-
                     der of total length/SegmentDuration.

                     Elastic  Transcoder  creates  an output-specific playlist
                     for each output HLS  output  that  you  specify  in  Out-
                     putKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this
                     job, include it  in  the  OutputKeys  of  the  associated
                     playlist.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  status of one output in a job. If you specified only
                     one output for the job, Outputs:Status is always the same
                     as Job:Status . If you specified more than one output:

                     o Job:Status and Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is
                       Submitted until Elastic Transcoder  starts  to  process
                       the first output.

                     o When  Elastic  Transcoder  starts  to process the first
                       output, Outputs:Status for that output  and  Job:Status
                       both  change to Progressing. For each output, the value
                       of  Outputs:Status  remains  Submitted  until   Elastic
                       Transcoder starts to process the output.

                     o Job:Status remains Progressing until all of the outputs
                       reach a terminal status, either Complete or Error.

                     o When all  of  the  outputs  reach  a  terminal  status,
                       Job:Status  changes  to Complete only if Outputs:Status
                       for all of the outputs is Complete . If  Outputs:Status
                       for  one or more outputs is Error , the terminal status
                       for Job:Status is also Error .

                     The value of Status is one of the following: Submitted  ,
                     Progressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .

                 StatusDetail -> (string)
                     Information that further explains Status .

                 Duration -> (long)
                     Duration of the output file, in seconds.

                 Width -> (integer)
                     Specifies the width of the output file in pixels.

                 Height -> (integer)
                     Height of the output file, in pixels.

                 FrameRate -> (string)
                     Frame rate of the output file, in frames per second.

                 FileSize -> (long)
                     File size of the output file, in bytes.

                 DurationMillis -> (long)
                     Duration of the output file, in milliseconds.

                 Watermarks -> (list)
                     Information  about  the  watermarks that you want Elastic
                     Transcoder to add to the video  during  transcoding.  You
                     can  specify  up to four watermarks for each output. Set-
                     tings for each watermark must be defined  in  the  preset
                     that you specify in Preset for the current output.

                     Watermarks  are added to the output video in the sequence
                     in which you list them in the job outputthe first  water-
                     mark  in the list is added to the output video first, the
                     second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As
                     a  result,  if  the  settings  in  a preset cause Elastic
                     Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same  location,
                     the  second  watermark that you add covers the first one,
                     the third one covers the second, and the fourth one  cov-
                     ers the third.

                     (structure)
                        Watermarks  can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want
                        to display a watermark that is  not  rectangular,  use
                        the .png format, which supports transparency.

                        PresetWatermarkId -> (string)
                            The  ID  of  the  watermark  settings that Elastic
                            Transcoder uses to add  watermarks  to  the  video
                            during transcoding. The settings are in the preset
                            specified by Preset for  the  current  output.  In
                            that  preset,  the  value  of  Watermarks Id tells
                            Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.

                        InputKey -> (string)
                            The name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to
                            use  for  the watermark. To determine which Amazon
                            S3 bucket contains  the  specified  file,  Elastic
                            Transcoder  checks the pipeline specified by Pipe-
                            line ; the Input Bucket object  in  that  pipeline
                            identifies the bucket.

                            If  the  file name includes a prefix, for example,
                            logos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the  key.
                            If the file isn't in the specified bucket, Elastic
                            Transcoder returns an error.

                        Encryption -> (structure)
                            The encryption settings, if  any,  that  you  want
                            Elastic Transcoder to apply to your watermarks.

                            Mode -> (string)
                               The  specific  server-side encryption mode that
                               you want Elastic Transcoder  to  use  when  de-
                               crypting  your  input  files or encrypting your
                               output files. Elastic Transcoder  supports  the
                               following options:

                               o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates and manages the keys
                                 used for encrypting your files.

                               o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls  the  Amazon  Key
                                 Management Service, which creates and manages
                                 the keys that are used  for  encrypting  your
                                 files.  If  you  specify  s3-aws-kms  and you
                                 don't want to use the default key,  you  must
                                 add  the  AWS-KMS key that you want to use to
                                 your pipeline.

                               o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode  of
                                 operation originally used for HLS files.

                               o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                               o aes-gcm:  AES  Galois Counter Mode, a mode of
                                 operation that is an authenticated encryption
                                 format, meaning that a file, key, or initial-
                                 ization vector that has  been  tampered  with
                                 fails the decryption process.

                               For all three AES options, you must provide the
                               following settings, which  must  be  base64-en-
                               coded:

                               o Key

                               o Key MD5

                               o Initialization Vector

                               WARNING:
                                   For  the AES modes, your private encryption
                                   keys and your unencrypted  data  are  never
                                   stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is important
                                   that  you  safely  manage  your  encryption
                                   keys.  If  you lose them, you won't be able
                                   to unencrypt your data.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The data encryption key that you  want  Elastic
                               Transcoder  to use to encrypt your output file,
                               or that was used to encrypt  your  input  file.
                               The  key  must be base64-encoded and it must be
                               one of the following bit lengths  before  being
                               base64-encoded:
                                   128 , 192 , or 256 .

                               The  key  must  also  be encrypted by using the
                               Amazon Key Management Service.

                            KeyMd5 -> (string)
                               The MD5 digest of the key that you used to  en-
                               crypt your input file, or that you want Elastic
                               Transcoder to use to encrypt your output  file.
                               Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the  key digest as a
                               checksum to make sure your  key  was  not  cor-
                               rupted   in   transit.  The  key  MD5  must  be
                               base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes
                               long before being base64-encoded.

                            InitializationVector -> (string)
                               The  series  of random bits created by a random
                               bit generator, unique for every encryption  op-
                               eration,  that  you  used to encrypt your input
                               files or that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to
                               use  to encrypt your output files. The initial-
                               ization vector must be base64-encoded,  and  it
                               must  be  exactly  16  bytes  long before being
                               base64-encoded.

                 AlbumArt -> (structure)
                     The album art to be associated with the output  file,  if
                     any.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A  policy  that determines how Elastic Transcoder han-
                        dles the existence of multiple album artwork files.

                        o Replace: The specified album art replaces any exist-
                          ing album art.

                        o Prepend:  The specified album art is placed in front
                          of any existing album art.

                        o Append: The specified album art is placed after  any
                          existing album art.

                        o Fallback:  If  the original input file contains art-
                          work, Elastic Transcoder uses that artwork  for  the
                          output.  If the original input does not contain art-
                          work, Elastic Transcoder uses  the  specified  album
                          art file.

                     Artwork -> (list)
                        The  file to be used as album art. There can be multi-
                        ple artworks associated with an audio file, to a maxi-
                        mum of 20. Valid formats are .jpg and .png

                        (structure)
                            The  file  to  be  used as album art. There can be
                            multiple artworks associated with an  audio  file,
                            to a maximum of 20.

                            To  remove artwork or leave the artwork empty, you
                            can either set Artwork to null, or set  the  Merge
                            Policy  to  "Replace" and use an empty Artwork ar-
                            ray.

                            To pass through existing  artwork  unchanged,  set
                            the Merge Policy to "Prepend", "Append", or "Fall-
                            back", and use an empty Artwork array.

                            InputKey -> (string)
                               The name of the file to be used as  album  art.
                               To  determine  which  Amazon S3 bucket contains
                               the specified file, Elastic  Transcoder  checks
                               the  pipeline specified by PipelineId ; the In-
                               putBucket object in  that  pipeline  identifies
                               the bucket.

                               If  the  file name includes a prefix, for exam-
                               ple, cooking/pie.jpg , include  the  prefix  in
                               the  key.  If  the  file isn't in the specified
                               bucket, Elastic Transcoder returns an error.

                            MaxWidth -> (string)
                               The maximum width of the output  album  art  in
                               pixels.   If   you   specify   auto  ,  Elastic
                               Transcoder uses 600 as the  default  value.  If
                               you  specify a numeric value, enter an even in-
                               teger between 32 and 4096, inclusive.

                            MaxHeight -> (string)
                               The maximum height of the output album  art  in
                               pixels.   If   you   specify   auto  ,  Elastic
                               Transcoder uses 600 as the  default  value.  If
                               you  specify a numeric value, enter an even in-
                               teger between 32 and 3072, inclusive.

                            SizingPolicy -> (string)
                               Specify one of the following values to  control
                               scaling of the output album art:

                               o Fit: Elastic Transcoder scales the output art
                                 so it matches the value that you specified in
                                 either  MaxWidth or MaxHeight without exceed-
                                 ing the other value.

                               o Fill: Elastic Transcoder  scales  the  output
                                 art  so  it matches the value that you speci-
                                 fied in  either  MaxWidth  or  MaxHeight  and
                                 matches  or  exceeds the other value. Elastic
                                 Transcoder centers the output  art  and  then
                                 crops  it  in the dimension (if any) that ex-
                                 ceeds the maximum value.

                               o Stretch:  Elastic  Transcoder  stretches  the
                                 output art to match the values that you spec-
                                 ified for MaxWidth and  MaxHeight  .  If  the
                                 relative proportions of the input art and the
                                 output art are different, the output art will
                                 be distorted.

                               o Keep:  Elastic  Transcoder does not scale the
                                 output art. If either dimension of the  input
                                 art exceeds the values that you specified for
                                 MaxWidth and MaxHeight ,  Elastic  Transcoder
                                 crops the output art.

                               o ShrinkToFit:  Elastic  Transcoder  scales the
                                 output art down so that its dimensions  match
                                 the  values  that  you specified for at least
                                 one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceed-
                                 ing either value. If you specify this option,
                                 Elastic Transcoder does not scale the art up.

                               o ShrinkToFill Elastic  Transcoder  scales  the
                                 output  art down so that its dimensions match
                                 the values that you specified  for  at  least
                                 one  of  MaxWidth and MaxHeight without drop-
                                 ping below either value. If you specify  this
                                 option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale the
                                 art up.

                            PaddingPolicy -> (string)
                               When you set PaddingPolicy  to  Pad  ,  Elastic
                               Transcoder  may  add  white bars to the top and
                               bottom and/or left and right sides of the  out-
                               put  album  art  to  make the total size of the
                               output art match the values that you  specified
                               for MaxWidth and MaxHeight .

                            AlbumArtFormat -> (string)
                               The  format of album art, if any. Valid formats
                               are .jpg and .png .

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any, that you  want
                               Elastic Transcoder to apply to your artwork.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when  decrypting  your  input  files or en-
                                   crypting   your   output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3  calls  the  Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages the keys that are  used  for  en-
                                     crypting   your  files.  If  you  specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode
                                     of operation that is an authenticated en-
                                     cryption format,  meaning  that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                   WARNING:
                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 Composition -> (list)
                     You  can  create  an output file that contains an excerpt
                     from the input file. This excerpt,  called  a  clip,  can
                     come  from the beginning, middle, or end of the file. The
                     Composition object contains settings for the  clips  that
                     make  up an output file. For the current release, you can
                     only specify settings for a single clip per output  file.
                     The Composition object cannot be null.

                     (structure)
                        Settings  for one clip in a composition. All jobs in a
                        playlist must have the same clip settings.

                        TimeSpan -> (structure)
                            Settings that determine when a clip begins and how
                            long it lasts.

                            StartTime -> (string)
                               The  place  in  the input file where you want a
                               clip  to  start.  The  format  can  be   either
                               HH:mm:ss.SSS  (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS
                               is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maxi-
                               mum  value:  86399.999). If you don't specify a
                               value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the  begin-
                               ning of the input file.

                            Duration -> (string)
                               The duration of the clip. The format can be ei-
                               ther HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999;
                               SSS  is  thousandths  of a second) or sssss.SSS
                               (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don't  spec-
                               ify a value, Elastic Transcoder creates an out-
                               put file from StartTime to the end of the file.

                               If you specify a value longer than the duration
                               of   the   input   file,   Elastic   Transcoder
                               transcodes the file and returns a warning  mes-
                               sage.

                 Captions -> (structure)
                     You  can  configure  Elastic Transcoder to transcode cap-
                     tions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All cap-
                     tions  must  be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two
                     types of captions:

                     o Embedded: Embedded captions are included  in  the  same
                       file  as  the  audio and video. Elastic Transcoder sup-
                       ports only one embedded caption per language, to a max-
                       imum  of  300  embedded  captions per file. Valid input
                       values include:  CEA-608  (EIA-608  ,  first  non-empty
                       channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty chan-
                       nel  only),  and  mov-text    Valid  outputs   include:
                       mov-text   Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one
                       embedded format per output.

                     o Sidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate  meta-
                       data  file  from the audio and video data. Sidecar cap-
                       tions require a player that is capable of understanding
                       the relationship between the video file and the sidecar
                       file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar cap-
                       tion  per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions
                       per file. Valid input values include: dfxp  (first  div
                       element  only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first
                       div element only), and webvtt   Valid outputs  include:
                       dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .

                     If you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify
                     dfxp as your output format.

                     Elastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical  Charac-
                     ter Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid in-
                     put for captions, and is  not  available  for  audio-only
                     transcoding.  Elastic  Transcoder  does not preserve text
                     formatting (for example, italics) during the  transcoding
                     process.

                     To  remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Cap-
                     tions to null. To  pass  through  existing  captions  un-
                     changed, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass in
                     a null CaptionSources array.

                     For more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles
                     Wikipedia page.

                     For more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible
                     Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.

                     MergePolicy -> (string)
                        A policy that determines how Elastic  Transcoder  han-
                        dles the existence of multiple captions.

                        o MergeOverride:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes both
                          embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If  cap-
                          tions  for a language are embedded in the input file
                          and  also  appear  in  a   sidecar   file,   Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the
                          embedded captions for that language.

                        o MergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both  em-
                          bedded  and  sidecar  captions into outputs. If cap-
                          tions for a language are embedded in the input  file
                          and   also   appear   in  a  sidecar  file,  Elastic
                          Transcoder uses the embedded  captions  and  ignores
                          the  sidecar captions for that language. If Caption-
                          Sources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all side-
                          car captions from the output files.

                        o Override:  Elastic  Transcoder  transcodes  only the
                          sidecar captions that you specify in  CaptionSources
                          .
                            MergePolicy cannot be null.

                     CaptionSources -> (list)
                        Source  files for the input sidecar captions used dur-
                        ing the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar  cap-
                        tions, leave CaptionSources blank.

                        (structure)
                            A  source file for the input sidecar captions used
                            during the transcoding process.

                            Key -> (string)
                               The name of the sidecar caption file  that  you
                               want  Elastic Transcoder to include in the out-
                               put file.

                            Language -> (string)
                               A string that specifies  the  language  of  the
                               caption.  If you specified multiple inputs with
                               captions, the caption language  must  match  in
                               order  to  be  included  in the output. Specify
                               this as one of:

                               o 2-character ISO 639-1 code

                               o 3-character ISO 639-2 code

                               For more information on ISO language codes  and
                               language  names,  see  the  List  of  ISO 639-1
                               codes.

                            TimeOffset -> (string)
                               For clip generation or  captions  that  do  not

                               when choosing a language. We recommend that you
                               put the caption language name here, in the lan-
                               guage of the captions.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any,  that  Elastic
                               Transcoder   needs   to  decyrpt  your  caption
                               sources, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to
                               apply to your caption sources.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The  specific  server-side  encryption mode
                                   that you want  Elastic  Transcoder  to  use
                                   when  decrypting  your  input  files or en-
                                   crypting   your   output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3:  Amazon  S3  creates  and manages the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                   o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3  calls  the  Amazon
                                     Key Management Service, which creates and
                                     manages the keys that are  used  for  en-
                                     crypting   your  files.  If  you  specify
                                     s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use  the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a  mode
                                     of operation that is an authenticated en-
                                     cryption format,  meaning  that  a  file,
                                     key,  or  initialization  vector that has
                                     been tampered with fails  the  decryption
                                     process.

                                   For all three AES options, you must provide
                                   the  following  settings,  which  must   be
                                   base64-encoded:

                                   o Key

                                   o Key MD5

                                   o Initialization Vector

                                      For  the AES modes, your private encryp-
                                      tion keys and your unencrypted data  are
                                      never  stored  by  AWS; therefore, it is
                                      important that you  safely  manage  your
                                      encryption  keys.  If you lose them, you
                                      won't be able to unencrypt your data.

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The data encryption key that you want Elas-
                                   tic  Transcoder to use to encrypt your out-
                                   put file, or that was used to encrypt  your
                                   input  file. The key must be base64-encoded
                                   and it must be one  of  the  following  bit
                                   lengths before being base64-encoded:
                                      128 , 192 , or 256 .

                                   The key must also be encrypted by using the
                                   Amazon Key Management Service.

                               KeyMd5 -> (string)
                                   The MD5 digest of the key that you used  to
                                   encrypt  your  input file, or that you want
                                   Elastic Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your
                                   output  file.  Elastic  Transcoder uses the
                                   key digest as a checksum to make sure  your
                                   key  was  not corrupted in transit. The key
                                   MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must  be
                                   exactly   16   bytes   long   before  being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion operation, that you  used  to  encrypt
                                   your  input  files or that you want Elastic
                                   Transcoder to use to  encrypt  your  output
                                   files.  The  initialization  vector must be
                                   base64-encoded, and it must be  exactly  16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                     CaptionFormats -> (list)
                        The  array of file formats for the output captions. If
                        you leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns
                        an error.

                        (structure)
                            The  file  format  of  the output captions. If you
                            leave this value blank, Elastic Transcoder returns
                            an error.

                            Format -> (string)
                               The format you specify determines whether Elas-
                               tic Transcoder generates an embedded or sidecar
                               caption for this output.

                               o Valid Embedded Caption Formats:

                                 o for FLAC : None

                                 o For MP3 : None

                               o Valid   Sidecar   Caption   Formats:  Elastic
                                 Transcoder supports dfxp (first  div  element
                                 only), scc, srt, and webvtt. If you want ttml
                                 or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp
                                 as your output format.

                                 o For FMP4 : dfxp

                                 o Non-FMP4 outputs : All sidecar types
                                   fmp4 captions have an extension of .ismt

                            Pattern -> (string)
                               The  prefix  for caption filenames, in the form
                               description -{language} , where:

                               o description is a description of the video.

                               o {language} is a literal  value  that  Elastic
                                 Transcoder   replaces   with   the   two-  or
                                 three-letter code for  the  language  of  the
                                 caption in the output file names.

                               If  you  don't  include  {language} in the file
                               name pattern, Elastic Transcoder  automatically
                               appends  "{language}  "  to  the value that you
                               specify for the description. In addition, Elas-
                               tic  Transcoder automatically appends the count
                               to the end of the segment files.

                               For example, suppose  you're  transcoding  into
                               srt   format.   When  you  enter  "Sydney-{lan-
                               guage}-sunrise", and the language of  the  cap-
                               tions  is  English  (en), the name of the first
                               caption file is be Sydney-en-sunrise00000.srt.

                            Encryption -> (structure)
                               The encryption settings, if any, that you  want

                               formats.

                               Mode -> (string)
                                   The specific  server-side  encryption  mode

                                   when decrypting your  input  files  or  en-
                                   crypting   your   output   files.   Elastic
                                   Transcoder supports the following options:

                                   o s3: Amazon S3  creates  and  manages  the
                                     keys used for encrypting your files.

                                     manages  the  keys  that are used for en-
                                     crypting  your  files.  If  you   specify
                                     s3-aws-kms  and you don't want to use the
                                     default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key
                                     that you want to use to your pipeline.

                                   o aes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode
                                     of  operation  originally  used  for  HLS
                                     files.

                                   o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                                   o aes-gcm:  AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode
                                     of operation that is an authenticated en-

                                   encrypt your input file, or that  you  want
                                   Elastic  Transcoder  to use to encrypt your
                                   output file. Elastic  Transcoder  uses  the
                                   key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                                   key was not corrupted in transit.  The  key
                                   MD5  must be base64-encoded, and it must be
                                   exactly  16   bytes   long   before   being
                                   base64-encoded.

                               InitializationVector -> (string)
                                   The series of random bits created by a ran-
                                   dom bit generator, unique for every encryp-
                                   tion  operation,  that  you used to encrypt
                                   your input files or that you  want  Elastic
                                   Transcoder  to  use  to encrypt your output
                                   files. The initialization  vector  must  be
                                   base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16
                                   bytes long before being base64-encoded.

                 Encryption -> (structure)
                     The encryption settings, if any, that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder  to  apply to your output files. If you choose
                     to use encryption, you must specify a mode to use. If you
                     choose  not  to use encryption, Elastic Transcoder writes
                     an unencrypted file to your Amazon S3 bucket.

                     Mode -> (string)
                        The specific server-side encryption mode that you want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to use when decrypting your input
                        files  or  encrypting  your  output   files.   Elastic
                        Transcoder supports the following options:

                        o s3:  Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for
                          encrypting your files.

                        o s3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon  Key  Manage-
                          ment  Service,  which  creates  and manages the keys
                          that are used for  encrypting  your  files.  If  you
                          specify s3-aws-kms and you don't want to use the de-
                          fault key, you must add the  AWS-KMS  key  that  you
                          want to use to your pipeline.

                        o aes-cbc-pkcs7:  A padded cipher-block mode of opera-
                          tion originally used for HLS files.

                        o aes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.

                        o aes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode  of  opera-
                          tion  that  is  an  authenticated encryption format,
                          meaning that a file, key, or  initialization  vector
                          that  has  been  tampered  with fails the decryption
                          process.

                        For all three AES options, you must provide  the  fol-
                        lowing settings, which must be base64-encoded:

                        o Key

                        o Key MD5

                        o Initialization Vector

                        WARNING:
                            For  the  AES  modes, your private encryption keys
                            and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS;
                            therefore,  it is important that you safely manage
                            your encryption keys. If you lose them, you  won't
                            be able to unencrypt your data.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The   data   encryption  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                        Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that
                        was  used  to encrypt your input file. The key must be
                        base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit
                        lengths before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                        The key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key
                        Management Service.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The MD5 digest of the key that  you  used  to  encrypt
                        your  input  file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder
                        to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder
                        uses  the  key  digest as a checksum to make sure your
                        key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must  be
                        base64-encoded,  and  it must be exactly 16 bytes long
                        before being base64-encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator,  unique  for  every encryption operation, that
                        you used to encrypt your input files or that you  want
                        Elastic  Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt  your output
                        files. The initialization vector  must  be  base64-en-
                        coded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before be-
                        ing base64-encoded.

                 AppliedColorSpaceConversion -> (string)
                     If Elastic Transcoder used a preset with a ColorSpaceCon-
                     versionMode to transcode the output file, the AppliedCol-
                     orSpaceConversion parameter shows the conversion used. If
                     no  ColorSpaceConversionMode  was  defined in the preset,
                     this parameter is not be included in the job response.

          OutputKeyPrefix -> (string)
              The value, if any, that you want Elastic Transcoder  to  prepend
              to  the names of all files that this job creates, including out-
              put files, thumbnails, and playlists. We recommend that you  add
              a / or some other delimiter to the end of the OutputKeyPrefix .

          Playlists -> (list)

              WARNING:
                 Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.

              If  you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Con-
              tainer is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists  con-
              tains information about the master playlists that you want Elas-
              tic Transcoder to create.

              The maximum number of master playlists in a job is 30.

              (structure)
                 Use Only for Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS Outputs. If you  spec-
                 ify  a preset for which the value of Container is fmp4 (Frag-
                 mented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), Playlists  contains  information
                 about  the  master playlists that you want Elastic Transcoder
                 to create. We recommend  that  you  create  only  one  master
                 playlist  per  output  format.  The  maximum number of master
                 playlists in a job is 30.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name that you want Elastic Transcoder  to  assign  to
                     the  master  playlist, for example, nyc-vacation.m3u8. If
                     the name includes a / character, the section of the  name
                     before the last / must be identical for all Name objects.
                     If you create more than one master playlist,  the  values
                     of all Name objects must be unique.

                     NOTE:
                        Elastic  Transcoder automatically appends the relevant
                        file extension to the file name (.m3u8 for  HLSv3  and
                        HLSv4   playlists,  and  .ism  and  .ismc  for  Smooth
                        playlists). If you include a file extension in Name  ,
                        the file name will have two extensions.

                 Format -> (string)
                     The  format of the output playlist. Valid formats include
                     HLSv3 , HLSv4 , and Smooth .

                 OutputKeys -> (list)
                     For each output in this job that you want to include in a
                     master playlist, the value of the Outputs:Key object.

                     o If  your  output  is not HLS or does not have a segment
                       duration set, the name of the output file is a concate-
                       nation   of  OutputKeyPrefix  and  Outputs:Key  :  Out-
                       putKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``

                     o If your output is HLSv3 and has a segment duration set,
                       or  is  not  included in a playlist, Elastic Transcoder
                       creates an output playlist file with a  file  extension
                       of  .m3u8  ,  and  a series of .ts files that include a
                       five-digit sequential  counter  beginning  with  00000:
                       OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``    .m3u8   OutputKeyPre-
                       fix``Outputs:Key`` 00000.ts

                     o If your output is HLSv4 , has a segment  duration  set,
                       and   is   included   in  an  HLSv4  playlist,  Elastic
                       Transcoder creates an output playlist file with a  file
                       extension of _v4.m3u8 . If the output is video, Elastic
                       Transcoder also creates an output file with  an  exten-
                       sion  of  _iframe.m3u8 : OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``
                       _v4.m3u8  OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key``   _iframe.m3u8
                       OutputKeyPrefix``Outputs:Key`` .ts

                     Elastic  Transcoder  automatically  appends  the relevant
                     file extension to the file name. If you  include  a  file
                     extension  in Output Key, the file name will have two ex-
                     tensions.

                     If you include more than one output in  a  playlist,  any
                     segment duration settings, clip settings, or caption set-
                     tings must be the same for all outputs in  the  playlist.
                     For Smooth playlists, the Audio:Profile , Video:Profile ,
                     and Video:FrameRate to Video:KeyframesMaxDist ratio  must
                     be the same for all outputs.

                     (string)

                 HlsContentProtection -> (structure)
                     The  HLS  content  protection  settings, if any, that you
                     want Elastic Transcoder to apply to the output files  as-
                     sociated with this playlist.

                     Method -> (string)
                        The  content  protection  method  for your output. The
                        only valid value is: aes-128 .

                        This value is written into the method attribute of the
                        EXT-X-KEY metadata tag in the output playlist.

                     Key -> (string)
                        If  you  want Elastic Transcoder to generate a key for
                        you, leave this field blank.

                        If you choose to supply your own key, you must encrypt
                        the  key  by using AWS KMS. The key must be base64-en-
                        coded, and it must be one of the following bit lengths
                        before being base64-encoded:
                            128 , 192 , or 256 .

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        If  Elastic Transcoder is generating your key for you,
                        you must leave this field blank.

                        The MD5 digest  of  the  key  that  you  want  Elastic
                        Transcoder  to  use  to  encrypt your output file, and
                        that you want Elastic Transcoder to use as a  checksum
                        to  make  sure  your key was not corrupted in transit.
                        The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be ex-
                        actly 16 bytes before being base64- encoded.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        If  Elastic Transcoder is generating your key for you,
                        you must leave this field blank.

                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator,  unique  for  every encryption operation, that
                        you want Elastic Transcoder to  use  to  encrypt  your
                        output   files.  The  initialization  vector  must  be
                        base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes before
                        being base64-encoded.

                     LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                        The  location  of  the license key required to decrypt
                        your HLS playlist. The URL must be an  absolute  path,
                        and   is  referenced  in  the  URI  attribute  of  the
                        EXT-X-KEY metadata tag in the playlist file.

                     KeyStoragePolicy -> (string)
                        Specify whether you want Elastic Transcoder  to  write
                        your  HLS  license  key to an Amazon S3 bucket. If you
                        choose  WithVariantPlaylists  ,  LicenseAcquisitionUrl
                        must  be left blank and Elastic Transcoder writes your
                        data key  into  the  same  bucket  as  the  associated
                        playlist.

                 PlayReadyDrm -> (structure)
                     The   DRM   settings,  if  any,  that  you  want  Elastic
                     Transcoder to apply to the output files  associated  with
                     this playlist.

                     Format -> (string)
                        The  type  of  DRM,  if  any,  that  you  want Elastic
                        Transcoder to apply to  the  output  files  associated
                        with this playlist.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The  DRM  key  for your file, provided by your DRM li-
                        cense provider. The key must be base64-encoded, and it
                        must  be one of the following bit lengths before being
                        base64-encoded:

                        The key must also be encrypted by using AWS KMS.

                     KeyMd5 -> (string)
                        The MD5 digest of the key used for DRM on  your  file,
                        and  that  you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use as a
                        checksum to make sure your key was  not  corrupted  in
                        transit.  The  key  MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it
                        must be exactly 16 bytes before being base64-encoded.

                     KeyId -> (string)
                        The ID for your DRM key,  so  that  your  DRM  license
                        provider knows which key to provide.

                        The key ID must be provided in big endian, and Elastic
                        Transcoder converts it to little endian before insert-
                        ing  it into the PlayReady DRM headers. If you are un-
                        sure whether your license server provides your key  ID
                        in big or little endian, check with your DRM provider.

                     InitializationVector -> (string)
                        The series of random bits created by a random bit gen-
                        erator, unique for every  encryption  operation,  that
                        you  want  Elastic  Transcoder  to use to encrypt your
                        files. The initialization vector  must  be  base64-en-
                        coded,  and it must be exactly 8 bytes long before be-
                        ing base64-encoded. If  no  initialization  vector  is
                        provided, Elastic Transcoder generates one for you.

                     LicenseAcquisitionUrl -> (string)
                        The  location  of the license key required to play DRM
                        content. The URL must be an absolute path, and is ref-
                        erenced  by the PlayReady header. The PlayReady header
                        is referenced in the protection header of  the  client
                        manifest  for  Smooth  Streaming  outputs,  and in the
                        EXT-X-DXDRM and EXT-XDXDRMINFO metadata tags  for  HLS
                        playlist  outputs.  An  example  URL  looks like this:
                        https://www.example.com/exampleKey/

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the job with which the playlist is  associ-
                     ated.

                 StatusDetail -> (string)
                     Information that further explains the status.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the job: Submitted , Progressing , Complete , Can-
              celed , or Error .

          UserMetadata -> (map)
              User-defined metadata that you want to associate with an Elastic
              Transcoder job. You specify metadata in key/value pairs, and you
              can add up to 10 key/value pairs  per  job.  Elastic  Transcoder
              does not guarantee that key/value pairs are returned in the same
              order in which you specify them.

              Metadata keys and values must use characters from the  following
              list:

              o 0-9

              o A-Z and a-z

              o Space

              o The following symbols: _.:/=+-%@

              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

          Timing -> (structure)
              Details about the timing of a job.

              SubmitTimeMillis -> (long)
                 The  time  the  job  was  submitted to Elastic Transcoder, in
                 epoch milliseconds.

              StartTimeMillis -> (long)
                 The time the job began transcoding, in epoch milliseconds.

              FinishTimeMillis -> (long)
                 The time the job finished transcoding, in epoch milliseconds.



                                                                  CREATE-JOB()
