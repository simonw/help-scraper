DELETE-DB-INSTANCE()                                      DELETE-DB-INSTANCE()



NAME
       delete-db-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       The  DeleteDBInstance  action  deletes  a previously provisioned DB in-
       stance. When you delete a DB instance, all automated backups  for  that
       instance are deleted and can't be recovered. Manual DB snapshots of the
       DB instance to be deleted by DeleteDBInstance are not deleted.

       If you request a final DB snapshot the status of the Amazon Neptune  DB
       instance  is  deleting until the DB snapshot is created. The API action
       DescribeDBInstance is used to monitor the status of this operation. The
       action can't be canceled or reverted once submitted.

       Note  that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a status of
       failed , incompatible-restore , or incompatible-network , you can  only
       delete it when the SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is set to true .

       You  can't  delete  a  DB instance if it is the only instance in the DB
       cluster, or if it has deletion protection enabled.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-db-instance
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          [--skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot]
          [--final-db-snapshot-identifier <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The DB instance identifier for the DB instance to be  deleted.  This
          parameter isn't case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the name of an existing DB instance.

       --skip-final-snapshot | --no-skip-final-snapshot (boolean)
          Determines  whether a final DB snapshot is created before the DB in-
          stance is deleted. If true is specified, no DBSnapshot  is  created.
          If  false  is  specified, a DB snapshot is created before the DB in-
          stance is deleted.

          Note that when a DB instance is in a failure state and has a  status
          of  'failed',  'incompatible-restore', or 'incompatible-network', it
          can only be deleted when the SkipFinalSnapshot parameter is  set  to
          "true".

          Specify true when deleting a Read Replica.

          NOTE:
              The  FinalDBSnapshotIdentifier  parameter  must  be specified if
              SkipFinalSnapshot is false .

          Default: false

       --final-db-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The DBSnapshotIdentifier of the new DBSnapshot created when  SkipFi-
          nalSnapshot is set to false .

          NOTE:
              Specifying this parameter and also setting the SkipFinalShapshot
              parameter to true results in an error.

          Constraints:

          o Must be 1 to 255 letters or numbers.

          o First character must be a letter

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens

          o Cannot be specified when deleting a Read Replica.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
