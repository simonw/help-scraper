CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()                                        CREATE-DB-CLUSTER()



NAME
       create-db-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new Amazon Neptune DB cluster.

       You  can use the ReplicationSourceIdentifier parameter to create the DB
       cluster as a Read Replica of another DB cluster or  Amazon  Neptune  DB
       instance.

       Note that when you create a new cluster using CreateDBCluster directly,
       deletion protection is disabled by default (when you create a new  pro-
       duction  cluster  in the console, deletion protection is enabled by de-
       fault). You can only delete a  DB  cluster  if  its  DeletionProtection
       field is set to false .

              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB cluster is encrypted.

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption  key. If you are creating a DB cluster with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB  cluster,  then  you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN
          for the KMS encryption key.

          If an encryption key is not specified in KmsKeyId :

          o If ReplicationSourceIdentifier  identifies  an  encrypted  source,
            then  Amazon  Neptune  will use the encryption key used to encrypt
            the source. Otherwise, Amazon Neptune will use  your  default  en-
            cryption key.

          o If  the StorageEncrypted parameter is true and ReplicationSourceI-
            dentifier is not specified, then Amazon Neptune will use your  de-
            fault encryption key.

          Amazon  KMS  creates  the default encryption key for your Amazon ac-
          count. Your Amazon account has a different  default  encryption  key
          for each Amazon Region.

          If  you  create a Read Replica of an encrypted DB cluster in another
          Amazon Region, you must set KmsKeyId to a KMS key ID that  is  valid
          in  the  destination  Amazon Region. This key is used to encrypt the
          Read Replica in that Amazon Region.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          If set to true , enables Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          authentication for the entire DB cluster (this cannot be set  at  an
          instance level).

          Default: false .

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The  list  of  log  types  that  need to be enabled for exporting to
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is enabled.

       --serverless-v2-scaling-configuration (structure)
          Contains the scaling configuration of a Neptune Serverless DB  clus-
          ter.

          For  more  information,  see  Using Amazon Neptune Serverless in the
          Amazon Neptune User Guide .

          MinCapacity -> (double)
              The minimum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB in-
              stance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU val-
              ues in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on.

          MaxCapacity -> (double)
              The maximum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a DB in-
              stance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU val-
              ues in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and so on.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MinCapacity=double,MaxCapacity=double

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "MinCapacity": double,
            "MaxCapacity": double
          }

       --global-cluster-identifier (string)
          The ID of the Neptune global database to which this new  DB  cluster
          should be added.

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the source for the db cluster.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Neptune DB cluster
              storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts  as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier

              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas
              that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new  con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion requests among the Read Replicas in the  DB  cluster.  This
              functionality  can help balance your read workload across multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica  that  you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read  Replicas  in  the  cluster,  you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the  DB  cluster  has  instances  in  multiple
              Availability Zones.

          Engine -> (string)
              Provides  the name of the database engine to be used for this DB
              cluster.

          EngineVersion -> (string)
              Indicates the database engine version.

          LatestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the latest time to which a database  can  be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

              are created if automated backups are enabled, as  determined  by
              the BackupRetentionPeriod .

          PreferredMaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which system maintenance
              can occur, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).
