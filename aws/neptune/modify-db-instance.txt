OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  DB  instance  identifier.  This  value is stored as a lowercase
          string.

          Constraints:

          o Must match the identifier of an existing DBInstance.

       --allocated-storage (integer)
          Not supported by Neptune.

       --db-instance-class (string)
          The new compute and memory capacity of the DB instance, for example,
          db.m4.large  . Not all DB instance classes are available in all Ama-
          zon Regions.

          If you modify the DB instance class, an  outage  occurs  during  the
          change.  The  change  is applied during the next maintenance window,
          unless ApplyImmediately is specified as true for this request.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --db-subnet-group-name (string)
          The new DB subnet group for the DB instance. You can use this param-
          eter to move your DB instance to a different VPC.

          Changing  the  subnet  group causes an outage during the change. The
          change is applied during the next  maintenance  window,  unless  you
          specify true for the ApplyImmediately parameter.

          Constraints:  If supplied, must match the name of an existing DBSub-
          netGroup.

          Example: mySubnetGroup

       --db-security-groups (list)
          A list of DB security groups  to  authorize  on  this  DB  instance.
          Changing  this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
          asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing DBSecurityGroups.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of EC2 VPC security groups to authorize on this DB  instance.
          This change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.

          Not  applicable.  The  associated list of EC2 VPC security groups is
          managed by the DB cluster. For more information, see   ModifyDBClus-
          ter .

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match existing VpcSecurityGroupIds.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --apply-immediately | --no-apply-immediately (boolean)
          Specifies  whether the modifications in this request and any pending
          modifications are asynchronously applied as soon  as  possible,  re-
          gardless  of  the  PreferredMaintenanceWindow setting for the DB in-
          stance.

          If this parameter is set to false , changes to the DB  instance  are
          applied  during  the next maintenance window. Some parameter changes
          can cause an outage and are applied on the next call to  RebootDBIn-
          stance , or the next failure reboot.

          Default: false

       --master-user-password (string)
          Not supported by Neptune.

       --db-parameter-group-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  DB  parameter group to apply to the DB instance.
          Changing this setting doesn't result in  an  outage.  The  parameter
          group  name  itself is changed immediately, but the actual parameter
          changes are not  applied  until  you  reboot  the  instance  without
          failover. The db instance will NOT be rebooted automatically and the
          parameter changes will NOT be applied during  the  next  maintenance
          window.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Constraints: The DB parameter group must be in the same DB parameter
          group family as this DB instance.

       --backup-retention-period (integer)
          Not applicable. The retention period for automated backups  is  man-
          aged by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDBCluster .

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --preferred-backup-window (string)
          The  daily  time range during which automated backups are created if
          automated backups are enabled.

          Not applicable. The daily time range for creating automated  backups
          is  managed  by the DB cluster. For more information, see  ModifyDB-
          Cluster .

          Constraints:

          o Must be in the format hh24:mi-hh24:mi

          o Must be in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC)

          o Must not conflict with the preferred maintenance window

          o Must be at least 30 minutes

       --preferred-maintenance-window (string)
          The weekly time range (in UTC) during which system  maintenance  can
          occur,  which  might  result  in  an outage. Changing this parameter
          doesn't result in an outage, except in the following situation,  and
          the  change  is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. If there
          are pending actions that cause a reboot, and the maintenance  window
          is changed to include the current time, then changing this parameter
          will cause a reboot of the DB instance. If moving this window to the
          current  time, there must be at least 30 minutes between the current
          time and end of the window to ensure pending changes are applied.

          Default: Uses existing setting

          Format: ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi

          Valid Days: Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

          Constraints: Must be at least 30 minutes

       --multi-az | --no-multi-az (boolean)
          Specifies if the DB instance is a Multi-AZ deployment. Changing this
          parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is applied dur-
          ing the next maintenance window unless the ApplyImmediately  parame-
          ter is set to true for this request.

       --engine-version (string)
          The  version number of the database engine to upgrade to. Currently,
          setting this parameter has no effect. To upgrade your  database  en-
          gine to the most recent release, use the  ApplyPendingMaintenanceAc-
          tion API.

       --allow-major-version-upgrade | --no-allow-major-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this pa-
          rameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is asynchronously
          applied as soon as possible.

       --auto-minor-version-upgrade  |  --no-auto-minor-version-upgrade (bool-
       ean)
          Indicates that minor version upgrades are applied  automatically  to
          the DB instance during the maintenance window. Changing this parame-
          ter doesn't result in an outage except in the following case and the
          change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible. An outage will
          result if this parameter is set to true during the maintenance  win-
          dow, and a newer minor version is available, and Neptune has enabled
          auto patching for that engine version.

       --license-model (string)
          Not supported by Neptune.

       --iops (integer)
          The new Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value  for  the
          instance.

          Changing  this setting doesn't result in an outage and the change is
          applied during the next maintenance window unless  the  ApplyImmedi-
          ately parameter is set to true for this request.

          Default: Uses existing setting

       --option-group-name (string)
          (Not supported by Neptune)

       --new-db-instance-identifier (string)
          The  new  DB instance identifier for the DB instance when renaming a
          DB instance. When you change the DB instance identifier, an instance
          reboot  will occur immediately if you set Apply Immediately to true,
          or will occur during the next maintenance window  if  Apply  Immedi-
          ately to false. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o The first character must be a letter.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The  interval,  in  seconds, between points when Enhanced Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting En-
          hanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If  MonitoringRoleArn  is  specified,  then  you must also set Moni-
          toringInterval to a value other than 0.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60
