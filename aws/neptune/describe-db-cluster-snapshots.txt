NAME
       describe-db-cluster-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  DB cluster snapshots. This API action sup-
       ports pagination.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-db-cluster-snapshots is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: DBClusterSnapshots

OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The  ID  of  the DB cluster to retrieve the list of DB cluster snap-
          shots for. This parameter can't be used in conjunction with the  DB-
          ClusterSnapshotIdentifier parameter. This parameter is not case-sen-
          sitive.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an existing DBCluster.

       --db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          A specific DB cluster snapshot identifier to describe. This  parame-
          ter can't be used in conjunction with the DBClusterIdentifier param-
          eter. This value is stored as a lowercase string.

          Constraints:

          o If supplied, must match the identifier of an  existing  DBCluster-
            Snapshot.

          o If  this identifier is for an automated snapshot, the SnapshotType
            parameter must also be specified.

       --snapshot-type (string)
          The type of DB cluster snapshots to be returned. You can specify one
          of the following values:

          o automated  -  Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been auto-
            matically taken by Amazon Neptune for my Amazon account.

          o manual - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been  taken  by
            my Amazon account.

          o shared  -  Return  all  manual DB cluster snapshots that have been
            shared to my Amazon account.

          o public - Return all DB cluster snapshots that have been marked  as
            public.

          If  you  don't specify a SnapshotType value, then both automated and
          manual DB cluster snapshots are returned. You can include shared  DB
          cluster  snapshots  with  these results by setting the IncludeShared
          parameter to true . You can include public DB cluster snapshots with
          these results by setting the IncludePublic parameter to true .

          The IncludeShared and IncludePublic parameters don't apply for Snap-
          shotType values of manual or automated . The IncludePublic parameter
          doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to shared . The IncludeShared
          parameter doesn't apply when SnapshotType is set to public .

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-shared | --no-include-shared (boolean)
          True to include shared manual DB cluster snapshots from other Amazon
          accounts  that this Amazon account has been given permission to copy
          or restore, and otherwise false. The default is false .

          You can give an Amazon account permission to  restore  a  manual  DB
          cluster  snapshot  from another Amazon account by the  ModifyDBClus-
          terSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --include-public | --no-include-public (boolean)
          True to include manual DB cluster snapshots that are public and  can
          be  copied  or  restored by any Amazon account, and otherwise false.
          The default is false . The default is false.

          You can share a manual DB cluster snapshot as public  by  using  the
          ModifyDBClusterSnapshotAttribute API action.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An optional pagination token provided by a previous  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots request. If this parameter is specified,  the  response
          includes  only  records beyond the marker, up to the value specified
          by MaxRecords .

       DBClusterSnapshots -> (list)
          Provides a list of DB cluster snapshots for the user.

          (structure)
              Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

              This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDB-
              ClusterSnapshots action.

              AvailabilityZones -> (list)
                 Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
                 the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

                 (string)

              DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
                 Specifies the identifier for  a  DB  cluster  snapshot.  Must
                 match the identifier of an existing snapshot.

                 After you restore a DB cluster using a DBClusterSnapshotIden-
                 tifier , you must specify the  same  DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
                 fier for any future updates to the DB cluster. When you spec-
                 ify this property for an update, the DB cluster  is  not  re-
                 stored  from the snapshot again, and the data in the database
                 is not changed.

                 However, if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier
                 , an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB cluster
                 is deleted. If you specify a property that is different  from
                 the previous snapshot restore property, the DB cluster is re-
                 stored from the snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnapshotI-
                 dentifier , and the original DB cluster is deleted.

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  DB  cluster identifier of the DB cluster that
                 this DB cluster snapshot was created from.

              Status -> (string)
                 Specifies the status of this DB cluster snapshot.

              Port -> (integer)
                 Specifies  the  port  that the DB cluster was listening on at
                 the time of the snapshot.

              VpcId -> (string)
                 Provides the VPC ID associated with the DB cluster snapshot.

              ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created,  in  Uni-

                 transferred.

              StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

              KmsKeyId -> (string)
                 If StorageEncrypted is true, the Amazon  KMS  key  identifier
