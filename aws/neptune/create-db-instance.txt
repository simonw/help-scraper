          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster that the instance will belong to.

          For information on creating a DB cluster, see  CreateDBCluster .

          Type: String

       --storage-type (string)
          Specifies the storage type to be associated with the DB instance.

          Not applicable. Storage is managed by the DB Cluster.

       --tde-credential-arn (string)

          TDE encryption.

       --tde-credential-password (string)
          The password for the given ARN from the key store in order to access
          the device.

       --storage-encrypted | --no-storage-encrypted (boolean)
          Specifies whether the DB instance is encrypted.

          Not applicable. The encryption for DB instances is managed by the DB
          cluster. For more information, see  CreateDBCluster .

          Default: false

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key identifier for an encrypted DB instance.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are creating a DB instance with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB  instance,  then you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN
          for the KM encryption key.

          Not applicable. The KMS key identifier is managed by the DB cluster.
          For more information, see  CreateDBCluster .

          If  the StorageEncrypted parameter is true, and you do not specify a
          value for the KmsKeyId parameter, then Amazon Neptune will use  your
          default  encryption  key.  Amazon KMS creates the default encryption
          key for your Amazon account. Your Amazon account has a different de-
          fault encryption key for each Amazon Region.

       --domain (string)
          Specify the Active Directory Domain to create the instance in.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          True  to  copy  all tags from the DB instance to snapshots of the DB
          instance, and otherwise false. The default is false.

       --monitoring-interval (integer)
          The interval, in seconds, between points  when  Enhanced  Monitoring
          metrics are collected for the DB instance. To disable collecting En-
          hanced Monitoring metrics, specify 0. The default is 0.

          If MonitoringRoleArn is specified, then  you  must  also  set  Moni-
          toringInterval to a value other than 0.

          Valid Values: 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60

       --monitoring-role-arn (string)
          The ARN for the IAM role that permits Neptune to send enhanced moni-
          toring   metrics   to   Amazon   CloudWatch   Logs.   For   example,
          arn:aws:iam:123456789012:role/emaccess .

          If  MonitoringInterval is set to a value other than 0, then you must
          supply a MonitoringRoleArn value.

       --domain-iam-role-name (string)
          Specify the name of the IAM role to be used when making API calls to
          the Directory Service.

       --promotion-tier (integer)
          A  value  that  specifies the order in which an Read Replica is pro-
          moted to the primary instance after a failure of the  existing  pri-
          mary instance.

          Default: 1

          Valid Values: 0 - 15

       --timezone (string)
          The time zone of the DB instance.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          Not supported by Neptune (ignored).

       --enable-performance-insights | --no-enable-performance-insights (bool-
       ean)
          (Not supported by Neptune)

       --performance-insights-kms-key-id (string)
          (Not supported by Neptune)

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The  list  of  log  types  that  need to be enabled for exporting to
          CloudWatch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB instance has deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is  enabled.  By  default,  deletion  protection  is  disabled.  See
          Deleting a DB Instance .

          DB  instances in a DB cluster can be deleted even when deletion pro-
          tection is enabled in their parent DB cluster.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
