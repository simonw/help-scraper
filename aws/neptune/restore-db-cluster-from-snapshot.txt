RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()          RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-FROM-SNAPSHOT()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-from-snapshot -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

       If  a  DB  snapshot is specified, the target DB cluster is created from
       the source DB snapshot with a default configuration and  default  secu-
       rity group.

       If a DB cluster snapshot is specified, the target DB cluster is created
       from the source DB cluster restore point with the same configuration as
       the  original source DB cluster, except that the new DB cluster is cre-
       ated with the default security group.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the restored DB cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata  assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A key is the required name of the tag. The string  value  can
                 be  from  1  to 128 Unicode characters in length and can't be
                 prefixed with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain  the

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted DB
          cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB  cluster,  then  you can use the KMS key alias instead of the ARN
          for the KMS encryption key.

          If you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  then  the
          following will occur:

          o If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is encrypted using the KMS
            key  that  was used to encrypt the DB snapshot or DB cluster snap-
            shot.

          o If the DB snapshot or DB cluster snapshot in SnapshotIdentifier is
            not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is not encrypted.

            terGroup.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled.

       --copy-tags-to-snapshot | --no-copy-tags-to-snapshot (boolean)
          If set to ``true`` , tags are copied to any snapshot of the restored
          DB cluster that is created.

            "MaxCapacity": double
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          ters .

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage  always  returns  1, because Neptune DB cluster
              storage size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts  as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies the number of days for which  automatic  DB  snapshots

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains  the  name  of  the initial database of this DB cluster
              that was provided at create time, if one was specified when  the
              DB  cluster was created. This same name is returned for the life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This  identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies  the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster,  including  the  name,  description, and subnets in the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)

              Specifies the earliest time to which a database can be  restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies  the  connection  endpoint for the primary instance of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint  for
              a  DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read Replicas
              that are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new  con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion requests among the Read Replicas in the  DB  cluster.  This
              functionality  can help balance your read workload across multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If a failover occurs, and the Read Replica  that  you  are  con-
              nected  to  is promoted to be the primary instance, your connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read  Replicas  in  the  cluster,  you can then reconnect to the
              reader endpoint.

                       on your behalf.

                     o PENDING - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the
                       DB cluster.

                     o INVALID  -  the  IAM role ARN is associated with the DB
                       cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM
                       role  in  order to access other Amazon services on your
                       behalf.

          PendingModifiedValues -> (structure)
              This  data  type  is used as a response element in the ModifyDB-
              Cluster operation and contains changes that will be applied dur-
              ing the next maintenance window.

              PendingCloudwatchLogsExports -> (structure)
                 This PendingCloudwatchLogsExports structure specifies pending
                 changes to which CloudWatch logs are enabled  and  which  are
                 disabled.

                 LogTypesToEnable -> (list)
                     Log  types  that are in the process of being deactivated.
                     After they are deactivated, these log  types  aren't  ex-
                     ported to CloudWatch Logs.

                     (string)

                 LogTypesToDisable -> (list)
                     Log types that are in the process of being enabled. After
                     they are enabled, these log types are exported to  Cloud-
                     Watch Logs.

                     (string)

              DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)

              IAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A value that indicates whether mapping of Amazon Web Services
                 Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database ac-
                 counts is enabled.

                 The allocated storage size in gibibytes  (GiB)  for  database
                 engines.  For Neptune, AllocatedStorage always returns 1, be-
                 cause Neptune DB cluster storage size isn't  fixed,  but  in-
                 stead automatically adjusts as needed.

              Iops -> (integer)
                 The  Provisioned IOPS (I/O operations per second) value. This
                 setting is only for non-Aurora Multi-AZ DB clusters.

          DeletionProtection -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether or not the DB cluster has deletion  protection

                 The minimum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a  DB
                 instance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU
                 values in half-step increments, such as 8, 8.5, 9, and so on.

              MaxCapacity -> (double)
                 The maximum number of Neptune capacity units (NCUs) for a  DB
                 instance in a Neptune Serverless cluster. You can specify NCU
                 values in half-step increments, such as 40, 40.5, 41, and  so
                 on.
