NAME
       describe-valid-db-instance-modifications -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can call  DescribeValidDBInstanceModifications to learn what modi-
       fications you can make to your DB instance. You can use  this  informa-
       tion when you call  ModifyDBInstance .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-valid-db-instance-modifications
          --db-instance-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --db-instance-identifier (string)
          The customer identifier or the ARN of your DB instance.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ValidDBInstanceModificationsMessage -> (structure)
          Information  about  valid modifications that you can make to your DB
          instance. Contains the result of  a  successful  call  to  the   De-
          scribeValidDBInstanceModifications action. You can use this informa-
          tion when you call  ModifyDBInstance .

          Storage -> (list)
              Valid storage options for your DB instance.

              (structure)
                 Information about valid modifications that you  can  make  to
                 your DB instance.

                 Contains  the  result  of  a  successful  call  to  the   De-
                 scribeValidDBInstanceModifications action.

                 StorageType -> (string)
                     The valid storage types for your DB instance.  For  exam-
                     ple, gp2, io1.

                 StorageSize -> (list)
                     The valid range of storage in gibibytes. For example, 100
                     to 16384.

                     (structure)
                        A range of integer values.

                        From -> (integer)
                            The minimum value in the range.

                        To -> (integer)
                            The maximum value in the range.

                        Step -> (integer)
                            The step value for the range. For example, if  you
                            have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value
                            of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step
                            up  by  1,000.  Even  though  7,500  is within the
                            range, it isn't a valid value for the  range.  The
                            valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000...

                 ProvisionedIops -> (list)
                     The   valid  range  of  provisioned  IOPS.  For  example,
                     1000-20000.

                     (structure)
                        A range of integer values.

                        From -> (integer)
                            The minimum value in the range.

                        To -> (integer)
                            The maximum value in the range.

                        Step -> (integer)
                            The step value for the range. For example, if  you
                            have a range of 5,000 to 10,000, with a step value
                            of 1,000, the valid values start at 5,000 and step
                            up  by  1,000.  Even  though  7,500  is within the
                            range, it isn't a valid value for the  range.  The
                            valid values are 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000...

                 IopsToStorageRatio -> (list)
                     The valid range of Provisioned IOPS to gibibytes of stor-
                     age multiplier. For example, 3-10, which means that  pro-
                     visioned IOPS can be between 3 and 10 times storage.

                     (structure)
                        A range of double values.

                        From -> (double)
                            The minimum value in the range.

                        To -> (double)
                            The maximum value in the range.
