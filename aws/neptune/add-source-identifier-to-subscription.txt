       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-source-identifier-to-subscription
          --subscription-name <value>
          --source-identifier <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subscription-name (string)
          The name of the event notification subscription you want  to  add  a
          source identifier to.

       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source to be added.

          Constraints:

          o If  the  source type is a DB instance, then a DBInstanceIdentifier
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB security group,  a  DBSecurityGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB parameter group, a DBParameterGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is a DB snapshot, a  DBSnapshotIdentifier  must
            be supplied.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
