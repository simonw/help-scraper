NAME
       apply-pending-maintenance-action -

DESCRIPTION
       Applies  a  pending maintenance action to a resource (for example, to a
       DB instance).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            apply-pending-maintenance-action
          --resource-identifier <value>
          --apply-action <value>
          --opt-in-type <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-identifier (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of  the  resource  that  the  pending
          maintenance  action  applies  to.  For information about creating an
          ARN, see Constructing an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) .

       --apply-action (string)
          The pending maintenance action to apply to this resource.

          Valid values: system-update , db-upgrade

       --opt-in-type (string)
          A value that specifies the type of  opt-in  request,  or  undoes  an
          opt-in request. An opt-in request of type immediate can't be undone.

          Valid values:

          o immediate - Apply the maintenance action immediately.

          o next-maintenance  -  Apply  the maintenance action during the next
            maintenance window for the resource.

          o undo-opt-in - Cancel  any  existing  next-maintenance  opt-in  re-
            quests.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourcePendingMaintenanceActions -> (structure)
          Describes the pending maintenance actions for a resource.

          ResourceIdentifier -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource that has pending maintenance actions.

          PendingMaintenanceActionDetails -> (list)
              A  list  that provides details about the pending maintenance ac-
              tions for the resource.

              (structure)
                 Provides information about a pending maintenance action for a
                 resource.

                 Action -> (string)
                     The  type of pending maintenance action that is available
                     for the resource.

                 AutoAppliedAfterDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date of the maintenance window when the action is ap-
                     plied.  The maintenance action is applied to the resource
                     during its first maintenance window after this  date.  If
                     this  date  is specified, any next-maintenance opt-in re-
                     quests are ignored.

                 ForcedApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The date when the maintenance action is automatically ap-
                     plied.  The maintenance action is applied to the resource
                     on this date regardless of the maintenance window for the
                     resource. If this date is specified, any immediate opt-in
                     requests are ignored.

                 OptInStatus -> (string)
                     Indicates the type of opt-in request that  has  been  re-
                     ceived for the resource.

                 CurrentApplyDate -> (timestamp)
                     The effective date when the pending maintenance action is
                     applied to the resource. This  date  takes  into  account
                     opt-in  requests  received  from the  ApplyPendingMainte-
                     nanceAction  API,  the  AutoAppliedAfterDate  ,  and  the
                     ForcedApplyDate  .  This  value is blank if an opt-in re-
                     quest has not been received and nothing has  been  speci-
                     fied as AutoAppliedAfterDate or ForcedApplyDate .

                 Description -> (string)
                     A description providing more detail about the maintenance
                     action.
