       To copy a DB cluster snapshot from a shared manual DB cluster snapshot,
       SourceDBClusterSnapshotIdentifier must  be  the  Amazon  Resource  Name
       (ARN) of the shared DB cluster snapshot.

OPTIONS
       --source-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the DB cluster snapshot to copy. This parameter is
          not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must specify a valid system snapshot in the "available" state.

          o Specify a valid DB snapshot identifier.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot1

       --target-db-cluster-snapshot-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the new DB cluster snapshot  to  create  from  the
          source DB cluster snapshot. This parameter is not case-sensitive.

          Constraints:

          o Must contain from 1 to 63 letters, numbers, or hyphens.

          o First character must be a letter.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

          Example: my-cluster-snapshot2

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The  Amazon  Amazon KMS key ID for an encrypted DB cluster snapshot.
          The KMS key ID is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN),  KMS  key  identi-
          fier, or the KMS key alias for the KMS encryption key.

          If  you  copy  an encrypted DB cluster snapshot from your Amazon ac-
          count, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with
          a  new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId
          , then the copy of the DB cluster snapshot  is  encrypted  with  the
          same KMS key as the source DB cluster snapshot.

          If you copy an encrypted DB cluster snapshot that is shared from an-
          other Amazon account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId .

          KMS encryption keys are specific to the Amazon Region that they  are
          created in, and you can't use encryption keys from one Amazon Region
          in another Amazon Region.

          You cannot encrypt an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot when you  copy
          it.  If you try to copy an unencrypted DB cluster snapshot and spec-
          ify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, an error is returned.

       --pre-signed-url (string)
          Not currently supported.

       --copy-tags | --no-copy-tags (boolean)
          True to copy all tags from the source DB  cluster  snapshot  to  the
          target  DB  cluster  snapshot,  and  otherwise false. The default is
          false.

       --tags (list)
          The tags to assign to the new DB cluster snapshot copy.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',       '=',       '+',       '-'       (Java       regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --source-region (string)
          The ID of the region that contains the snapshot to be copied.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

OUTPUT
       DBClusterSnapshot -> (structure)
          Contains the details for an Amazon Neptune DB cluster snapshot

          This data type is used as a response element in the  DescribeDBClus-
          terSnapshots action.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides  the  list  of EC2 Availability Zones that instances in
              the DB cluster snapshot can be restored in.

              (string)

          DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the identifier for a DB cluster snapshot.  Must  match
              the identifier of an existing snapshot.

              After  you restore a DB cluster using a DBClusterSnapshotIdenti-
              fier , you must specify the same DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier for
              any  future  updates  to  the  DB cluster. When you specify this
              property for an update, the DB cluster is not restored from  the
              snapshot again, and the data in the database is not changed.

              However,  if you don't specify the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              an empty DB cluster is created, and the original DB  cluster  is
              deleted.  If  you  specify a property that is different from the
              previous snapshot restore property, the DB cluster  is  restored
              from the snapshot specified by the DBClusterSnapshotIdentifier ,
              and the original DB cluster is deleted.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Specifies the DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster that  this
              DB cluster snapshot was created from.

          SnapshotCreateTime -> (timestamp)

              Specifies the port that the DB cluster was listening on  at  the
              time of the snapshot.

              Not supported by Neptune.

          EngineVersion -> (string)

          PercentProgress -> (integer)
              Specifies the percentage of the estimated  data  that  has  been
              transferred.

          StorageEncrypted -> (boolean)
              Specifies whether the DB cluster snapshot is encrypted.

          KmsKeyId -> (string)
              If  StorageEncrypted  is true, the Amazon KMS key identifier for
              the encrypted DB cluster snapshot.

          DBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster snapshot.

          SourceDBClusterSnapshotArn -> (string)
              If the DB cluster snapshot was copied from a source  DB  cluster
              snapshot, the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the source DB clus-
              ter snapshot, otherwise, a null value.
