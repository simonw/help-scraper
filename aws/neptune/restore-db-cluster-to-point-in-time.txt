RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()    RESTORE-DB-CLUSTER-TO-POINT-IN-TIME()



NAME
       restore-db-cluster-to-point-in-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Restores  a DB cluster to an arbitrary point in time. Users can restore
       to any point in time before LatestRestorableTime for up to BackupReten-
       tionPeriod  days.  The  target DB cluster is created from the source DB
       cluster with the same configuration as the original DB cluster,  except
       that the new DB cluster is created with the default DB security group.

       NOTE:
          This  action  only restores the DB cluster, not the DB instances for
          that DB cluster. You must invoke  the   CreateDBInstance  action  to
          create  DB  instances  for  the  restored DB cluster, specifying the
          identifier of the restored DB cluster in DBClusterIdentifier  .  You
          can create DB instances only after the RestoreDBClusterToPointInTime
          action has completed and the DB cluster is available.

          (Not supported by Neptune)

       --vpc-security-group-ids (list)
          A list of VPC security groups that the new DB cluster belongs to.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be applied to the restored DB cluster.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key identifier to use when restoring an encrypted  DB
          cluster from an encrypted DB cluster.

          The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the KMS
          encryption key. If you are restoring a DB cluster with the same Ama-
          zon account that owns the KMS encryption key used to encrypt the new
          DB cluster, then you can use the KMS key alias instead  of  the  ARN
          for the KMS encryption key.

          You  can  restore to a new DB cluster and encrypt the new DB cluster
          with a KMS key that is different than the KMS key  used  to  encrypt
          the  source DB cluster. The new DB cluster is encrypted with the KMS
          key identified by the KmsKeyId parameter.

          If you do not specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter,  then  the
          following will occur:

          o If  the  DB  cluster is encrypted, then the restored DB cluster is
            encrypted using the KMS key that was used to encrypt the source DB
            cluster.

          o If  the  DB cluster is not encrypted, then the restored DB cluster
            is not encrypted.

          If DBClusterIdentifier refers to a DB cluster that is not encrypted,
          then the restore request is rejected.

       --enable-iam-database-authentication | --no-enable-iam-database-authen-
       tication (boolean)
          True to enable mapping of  Amazon  Identity  and  Access  Management
          (IAM) accounts to database accounts, and otherwise false.

          Default: false

       --enable-cloudwatch-logs-exports (list)
          The list of logs that the restored DB cluster is to export to Cloud-
          Watch Logs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --db-cluster-parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the DB cluster parameter group to associate with the new
          DB cluster.

          Constraints:

          o If  supplied,  must match the name of an existing DBClusterParame-
            terGroup.

       --deletion-protection | --no-deletion-protection (boolean)
          A value that indicates whether the DB cluster has  deletion  protec-
          tion enabled. The database can't be deleted when deletion protection
          is enabled. By default, deletion protection is disabled.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          ters action.

          AllocatedStorage -> (integer)
              AllocatedStorage always returns 1, because  Neptune  DB  cluster
              storage  size is not fixed, but instead automatically adjusts as
              needed.

          AvailabilityZones -> (list)
              Provides the list of EC2 Availability Zones  that  instances  in
              the DB cluster can be created in.

              (string)

          BackupRetentionPeriod -> (integer)
              Specifies  the  number  of days for which automatic DB snapshots
              are retained.

          CharacterSetName -> (string)
              Not supported by Neptune.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              Contains the name of the initial database  of  this  DB  cluster
              that  was provided at create time, if one was specified when the
              DB cluster was created. This same name is returned for the  life
              of the DB cluster.

          DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
              Contains  a user-supplied DB cluster identifier. This identifier
              is the unique key that identifies a DB cluster.

          DBClusterParameterGroup -> (string)
              Specifies the name of the DB cluster parameter group for the  DB
              cluster.

          DBSubnetGroup -> (string)
              Specifies information on the subnet group associated with the DB
              cluster, including the name, description,  and  subnets  in  the
              subnet group.

          Status -> (string)
              Specifies the current state of this DB cluster.

          PercentProgress -> (string)
              Specifies the progress of the operation as a percentage.

          EarliestRestorableTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies  the earliest time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Endpoint -> (string)
              Specifies the connection endpoint for the  primary  instance  of
              the DB cluster.

          ReaderEndpoint -> (string)
              The  reader endpoint for the DB cluster. The reader endpoint for
              a DB cluster load-balances connections across the Read  Replicas
              that  are available in a DB cluster. As clients request new con-
              nections to the reader endpoint, Neptune distributes the connec-
              tion  requests  among  the Read Replicas in the DB cluster. This
              functionality can help balance your read workload across  multi-
              ple Read Replicas in your DB cluster.

              If  a  failover  occurs,  and the Read Replica that you are con-
              nected to is promoted to be the primary instance,  your  connec-
              tion is dropped. To continue sending your read workload to other
              Read Replicas in the cluster, you  can  then  reconnect  to  the
              reader endpoint.

          MultiAZ -> (boolean)

              Specifies  the  latest  time to which a database can be restored
              with point-in-time restore.

          Port -> (integer)
              Specifies the port that the database engine is listening on.

                     A value that specifies the order in which a Read  Replica
                     is  promoted  to  the primary instance after a failure of
                     the existing primary instance.

          VpcSecurityGroups -> (list)
              Provides a list of VPC security groups that the DB  cluster  be-
              longs to.

              (structure)
                 This  data  type is used as a response element for queries on

              If  StorageEncrypted  is true, the Amazon KMS key identifier for
              the encrypted DB cluster.

          DbClusterResourceId -> (string)
              The Amazon Region-unique, immutable identifier for the DB  clus-
              ter.  This  identifier is found in Amazon CloudTrail log entries
              whenever the Amazon KMS key for the DB cluster is accessed.

              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the DB cluster.

          AssociatedRoles -> (list)
              Provides a list of the Amazon  Identity  and  Access  Management
              (IAM)  roles  that are associated with the DB cluster. IAM roles
              that are associated with a DB cluster grant permission  for  the
              DB cluster to access other Amazon services on your behalf.

              (structure)
                 Describes an Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role

                     associated with the DB cluster.

                 Status -> (string)
                     Describes  the  state of association between the IAM role
                     and the DB cluster. The Status property  returns  one  of
                     the following values:

                     o ACTIVE  -  the  IAM  role ARN is associated with the DB
                       cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services
                       on your behalf.

                       DB cluster.

                     o INVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated  with  the  DB
                       cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM

              accounts to database accounts is enabled, and otherwise false.

          CloneGroupId -> (string)
              Identifies the clone group to which the DB  cluster  is  associ-
              ated.

          ClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)
              Specifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal
              Coordinated Time (UTC).
