OPTIONS
       --db-cluster-identifier (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with the end-
          point. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       --db-cluster-endpoint-identifier (string)
          The identifier to use for the new endpoint. This parameter is stored
          as a lowercase string.

       --endpoint-type (string)
          The type of the endpoint. One of: READER , WRITER , ANY .

       --static-members (list)
          List of DB instance identifiers that are part of the custom endpoint
          group.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --excluded-members (list)
          List  of DB instance identifiers that aren't part of the custom end-
          point group. All other eligible instances are reachable through  the
          custom  endpoint.  Only  relevant  if  the list of static members is
          empty.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The tags to be assigned to the Amazon Neptune resource.

          (structure)
              Metadata assigned to an Amazon Neptune resource consisting of  a
              key-value pair.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  key  is the required name of the tag. The string value can
                 be from 1 to 128 Unicode characters in length  and  can't  be
                 prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain the
                 set of Unicode letters, digits, white-space, '_',  '.',  '/',
                 '=', '+', '-' (Java regex: "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

              Value -> (string)
                 A  value  is  the optional value of the tag. The string value
                 can be from 1 to 256 Unicode characters in length  and  can't
                 be  prefixed  with aws: or rds: . The string can only contain
                 the set of Unicode letters, digits,  white-space,  '_',  '.',
                 '/',       '=',       '+',       '-'       (Java       regex:
                 "^([\p{L}\p{Z}\p{N}_.:/=+\-]*)$").

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DBClusterEndpointIdentifier -> (string)
          The  identifier  associated  with  the  endpoint.  This parameter is
          stored as a lowercase string.

       DBClusterIdentifier -> (string)
          The DB cluster identifier of the DB cluster associated with the end-
          point. This parameter is stored as a lowercase string.

       DBClusterEndpointResourceIdentifier -> (string)
          A unique system-generated identifier for an endpoint. It remains the
          same for the whole life of the endpoint.

       Endpoint -> (string)
          The DNS address of the endpoint.

       Status -> (string)
          The current status of the endpoint. One of: creating ,  available  ,
          deleting  ,  inactive , modifying . The inactive state applies to an
          endpoint that cannot be used for a certain kind of cluster, such  as
          a  writer  endpoint  for  a  read-only secondary cluster in a global
          database.

       EndpointType -> (string)
          The type of the endpoint. One of: READER , WRITER , CUSTOM .

       CustomEndpointType -> (string)
          The type associated with a custom endpoint. One of: READER ,  WRITER
          , ANY .

       StaticMembers -> (list)
          List of DB instance identifiers that are part of the custom endpoint
          group.

          (string)

       ExcludedMembers -> (list)
          List of DB instance identifiers that aren't part of the custom  end-
          point  group. All other eligible instances are reachable through the
          custom endpoint. Only relevant if the  list  of  static  members  is
          empty.

          (string)

       DBClusterEndpointArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the endpoint.
