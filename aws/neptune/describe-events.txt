DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to DB instances, DB security groups, DB snap-
       shots, and DB parameter groups for the past 14 days. Events specific to
       a  particular  DB instance, DB security group, database snapshot, or DB
       parameter group can be obtained by providing the name as  a  parameter.
       By default, the past hour of events are returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-events is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Events

OPTIONS
       --source-identifier (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, then all sources are included in the response.

          Constraints:

          o If SourceIdentifier is supplied, SourceType must also be provided.

          o If  the  source  type  is DBInstance , then a DBInstanceIdentifier
            must be supplied.

            be supplied.

          o If  the  source  type is DBParameterGroup , a DBParameterGroupName
            must be supplied.

          o If the source type is DBSnapshot , a DBSnapshotIdentifier must  be
            supplied.

          o Cannot end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.

       --source-type (string)
          The  event  source to retrieve events for. If no value is specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o db-instance

          o db-parameter-group

          o db-security-group

          o db-snapshot

          o db-cluster

          o db-cluster-snapshot

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in  ISO  8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in  ISO  8601 format. For more information about ISO 8601, go to the
          ISO8601 Wikipedia page.

          Example: 2009-07-08T18:00Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes to retrieve events for.

          Default: 60

       --event-categories (list)
          A list of event categories that trigger notifications  for  a  event
          notification subscription.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --filters (list)
          This parameter is not currently supported.

          (structure)
              This type is not currently supported.

              Name -> (string)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

              Values -> (list)
                 This parameter is not currently supported.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          An  optional pagination token provided by a previous Events request.
          If this parameter is specified, the response includes  only  records
          beyond the marker, up to the value specified by MaxRecords .

       Events -> (list)
          A list of  Event instances.

          (structure)
              This  data  type  is  used  as  a  response  element in the  De-
              scribeEvents action.

              SourceIdentifier -> (string)
                 Provides the identifier for the source of the event.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies the source type for this event.

              Message -> (string)
                 Provides the text of this event.

              EventCategories -> (list)
                 Specifies the category for the event.

                 (string)

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 Specifies the date and time of the event.

              SourceArn -> (string)
