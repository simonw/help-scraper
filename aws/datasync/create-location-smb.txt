OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          The subdirectory in the SMB file system that is used  to  read  data
          from  the  SMB source location or write data to the SMB destination.
          The SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server,  or
          a  subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can be
          mounted by other SMB clients in your network.

          NOTE:
              Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes.  For  exam-
              ple, /path/to/folder .

          To transfer all the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs
          to have permissions to mount the SMB share, as well as to access all
          the  data  in  that  share.  To  ensure this, either ensure that the
          user/password specified belongs to the user who can mount the share,
          and who has the appropriate permissions for all of the files and di-
          rectories that you want DataSync to access, or use credentials of  a
          member  of  the Backup Operators group to mount the share. Doing ei-
          ther enables the agent to access the data. For the agent  to  access
          directories, you must additionally enable all execute access.

       --server-hostname (string)
          The  name  of the SMB server. This value is the IP address or Domain
          Name Service (DNS) name of the SMB server.  An  agent  that  is  in-
          stalled  on-premises uses this hostname to mount the SMB server in a
          network.

          NOTE:
              This name must either be DNS-compliant or must be an IP  version
              4 (IPv4) address.

       --user (string)
          The  user  who  can  mount  the share, has the permissions to access
          files and folders in the SMB share.

          For information about choosing a user name that  ensures  sufficient
          permissions  to  files,  folders, and metadata, see the User setting
          for SMB locations.

       --domain (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user who can mount the share,  has  the  permis-
          sions to access files and folders in the SMB share.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Mes-
          sage Block (SMB) location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --mount-options (structure)
          The mount options used by DataSync to access the SMB server.

          Version -> (string)
              Specifies the SMB version that you want  DataSync  to  use  when
              mounting  your  SMB share. If you don't specify a version, Data-
              Sync defaults to AUTOMATIC and chooses a version based on  nego-
              tiation with the SMB server.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"
          }

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair that represents the tag that you want to add to
          the location. The value can be an empty string. We  recommend  using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source SMB file  system  loca-
          tion that is created.
