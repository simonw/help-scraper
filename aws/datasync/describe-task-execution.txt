DESCRIBE-TASK-EXECUTION()                            DESCRIBE-TASK-EXECUTION()



NAME
       describe-task-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed metadata about a task that is being executed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-task-execution
          --task-execution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --task-execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task that is being executed.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TaskExecutionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the task execution  that  was  de-
          scribed.  TaskExecutionArn  is hierarchical and includes TaskArn for
          the task that was executed.

          For example,  a  TaskExecution  value  with  the  ARN  arn:aws:data-
          sync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2/execu-
          tion/exec-08ef1e88ec491019b  executed  the   task   with   the   ARN
          arn:aws:datasync:us-east-1:111222333444:task/task-0208075f79cedf4a2
          .

       Status -> (string)
          The status of the task execution.

          For detailed information about task execution statuses,  see  Under-
          standing Task Statuses in the DataSync User Guide.

       Options -> (structure)
          Represents the options that are available to control the behavior of
          a StartTaskExecution operation. Behavior includes  preserving  meta-
          data  such  as  user ID (UID), group ID (GID), and file permissions,
          and also overwriting files in the destination, data integrity  veri-
          fication, and so on.

          A task has a set of default options associated with it. If you don't
          specify an option in StartTaskExecution , the default value is used.
          You  can  override  the  defaults  options on each task execution by
          specifying an overriding Options value to StartTaskExecution .

          VerifyMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether a  data  integrity  verification
              should  be  performed  at  the end of a task execution after all
              data and metadata have been transferred. For  more  information,
              see Configure task settings .

              Default value: POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT.

              ONLY_FILES_TRANSFERRED  (recommended): Perform verification only
              on files that were transferred.

              POINT_IN_TIME_CONSISTENT: Scan the entire source and entire des-
              tination  at  the  end of the transfer to verify that source and
              destination are fully synchronized. This option isn't  supported
              when transferring to S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive stor-
              age classes.

              NONE: No additional verification is  done  at  the  end  of  the
              transfer,  but all data transmissions are integrity-checked with
              checksum verification during the transfer.

          OverwriteMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether files at the destination  should
              be  overwritten or preserved when copying files. If set to NEVER
              a destination file will not be replaced by a source  file,  even
              if  the  destination  file  differs from the source file. If you
              modify files in the destination and you sync the files, you  can
              use this value to protect against overwriting those changes.

              Some  storage  classes  have  specific behaviors that can affect
              your  S3   storage   cost.   For   detailed   information,   see
              Considerations  when  working  with Amazon S3 storage classes in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

          Atime -> (string)
              A file metadata value that shows the last time a  file  was  ac-
              cessed  (that  is, when the file was read or written to). If you
              set Atime to BEST_EFFORT,  DataSync  attempts  to  preserve  the
              original  Atime attribute on all source files (that is, the ver-
              sion before the PREPARING phase). However, Atime 's behavior  is
              not  fully  standard  across  platforms, so DataSync can only do
              this on a best-effort basis.

              Default value: BEST_EFFORT.

              BEST_EFFORT: Attempt to preserve the per-file Atime value  (rec-
              ommended).

              NONE: Ignore Atime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Atime  is  set  to BEST_EFFORT, Mtime must be set to PRE-
                 SERVE.

                 If Atime is set to NONE, Mtime must also be NONE.

          Mtime -> (string)
              A value that indicates the last time that a  file  was  modified
              (that  is,  a  file  was written to) before the PREPARING phase.
              This option is required for cases when you need to run the  same
              task more than one time.

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve original Mtime (recommended)

              NONE: Ignore Mtime .

              NOTE:
                 If  Mtime  is  set to PRESERVE, Atime must be set to BEST_EF-
                 FORT.

                 If Mtime is set to NONE, Atime must also be set to NONE.

          Uid -> (string)
              The POSIX user ID (UID) of the file's owner. This option  should
              only  be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. To learn more about
              what metadata is copied by  DataSync,  see  Metadata  Copied  by
              DataSync .

              Default  value:  INT_VALUE.  This preserves the integer value of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE: Preserve the integer value of UID and group ID  (GID)
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          Gid -> (string)
              The  POSIX  group  ID  (GID)  of  the file's owners. This option
              should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more  in-
              formation  about  what  metadata  is  copied  by  DataSync,  see
              Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default value: INT_VALUE. This preserves the  integer  value  of
              the ID.

              INT_VALUE:  Preserve  the integer value of user ID (UID) and GID
              (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore UID and GID.

          PreserveDeletedFiles -> (string)
              A value that specifies whether files  in  the  destination  that
              don't  exist in the source file system should be preserved. This
              option can affect your storage cost. If your  task  deletes  ob-
              jects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for cer-
              tain   storage   classes.   For   detailed   information,    see
              Considerations  when  working  with Amazon S3 storage classes in
              DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).

              REMOVE: Delete destination  files  that  arent  present  in  the
              source.

          PreserveDevices -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines  whether DataSync should preserve the
              metadata of block and character devices in the source file  sys-
              tem,  and re-create the files with that device name and metadata
              on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of  such
              devices, only the name and metadata.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync  can't sync the actual contents of such devices, be-
                 cause they are nonterminal and don't  return  an  end-of-file
                 (EOF) marker.

              Default value: NONE.

              NONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).

              PRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This op-
              tion isn't currently supported for Amazon EFS.

          PosixPermissions -> (string)
              A value that determines which users or groups can access a  file
              for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of
              the file. This option should only be set for NFS,  EFS,  and  S3
              locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by
              DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync .

              Default value: PRESERVE.

              PRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).

              NONE: Ignore permissions.

              NOTE:
                 DataSync can preserve extant permissions of  a  source  loca-
                 tion.

          BytesPerSecond -> (long)
              A value that limits the bandwidth used by DataSync. For example,
              if you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to
              1048576 (=1024*1024 ).

          TaskQueueing -> (string)
              A  value  that  determines whether tasks should be queued before
              executing the tasks. If set to  ENABLED  ,  the  tasks  will  be
              queued. The default is ENABLED .

              If  you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable
              the tasks to run in series. For more information,  see  Queueing
              task executions .

          LogLevel -> (string)
              A value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes
              to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you pro-
              vide. For more information about providing a log group for Data-
              Sync, see CloudWatchLogGroupArn . If set to OFF ,  no  logs  are
              published.  BASIC  publishes logs on errors for individual files
              transferred, and TRANSFER publishes logs for every file  or  ob-
              ject that is transferred and integrity checked.

          TransferMode -> (string)
              A value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data
              and metadata that differ between the source and the  destination
              location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the
              source, without comparing to the destination location.

              CHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that  is  new  or
              different  content  from  the source location to the destination
              location.

              ALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destina-
              tion, without comparing to existing content on the destination.

          SecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)
              A value that determines which components of the SMB security de-
              scriptor are copied from source to destination objects.

              This value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx
              for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for
              Windows File Server locations. For more  information  about  how
              DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and
              Special Files .

              Default value: OWNER_DACL.
                 OWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the fol-
                 lowing metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              When choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS  sys-
              tem  access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administra-
              tors to log attempts to access a secured object.
                 OWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the
                 following metadata:

              o Object owner.

              o NTFS  discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which deter-
                mine whether to grant access to an object.

              o NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which  are  used  by
                administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.

              Copying  SACLs  requires  granting additional permissions to the
              Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For
              information  about  choosing a user that ensures sufficient per-
              missions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .
                 NONE : None of the SMB  security  descriptor  components  are
                 copied.  Destination  objects  are owned by the user that was
                 provided for accessing the destination  location.  DACLs  and
                 SACLs are set based on the destination servers configuration.

       Excludes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that determines which files to exclude from a
          task. The list should contain a single filter string  that  consists
          of  the patterns to exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that
          is, a pipe), for example: "/folder1|/folder2"

          (structure)
              Specifies which files, folders, and objects to  include  or  ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The  type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A single filter string that consists of the patterns  to  in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       Includes -> (list)
          A list of filter rules that determines which files to  include  when
          running  a task. The list should contain a single filter string that
          consists of the patterns to include. The patterns are  delimited  by
          "|" (that is, a pipe), for example: "/folder1|/folder2"

          (structure)
              Specifies  which  files,  folders, and objects to include or ex-
              clude when transferring files from source to destination.

              FilterType -> (string)
                 The type of filter rule to apply. DataSync only supports  the
                 SIMPLE_PATTERN rule type.

              Value -> (string)
                 A  single  filter string that consists of the patterns to in-
                 clude or exclude. The patterns are delimited by "|" (that is,
                 a pipe), for example: /folder1|/folder2

       StartTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the task execution was started.

       EstimatedFilesToTransfer -> (long)
          The expected number of files that is to be transferred over the net-
          work. This value is calculated during the  PREPARING  phase,  before
          the  TRANSFERRING  phase. This value is the expected number of files
          to be transferred. It's calculated based on comparing the content of
          the  source  and  destination  locations  and finding the delta that
          needs to be transferred.

       EstimatedBytesToTransfer -> (long)
          The estimated physical number of bytes that  is  to  be  transferred
          over the network.

       FilesTransferred -> (long)
          The  actual  number  of files that was transferred over the network.
          This value is calculated and updated on an ongoing basis during  the
          TRANSFERRING phase. It's updated periodically when each file is read
          from the source and sent over the network.

          If failures occur during a transfer, this value can be less than Es-
          timatedFilesToTransfer  .  This value can also be greater than Esti-
          matedFilesTransferred in some cases.  This  element  is  implementa-
          tion-specific for some location types, so don't use it as an indica-
          tor for a correct file number or to monitor your task execution.

       BytesWritten -> (long)
          The number of logical bytes written to the  destination  Amazon  Web
          Services storage resource.

       BytesTransferred -> (long)
          The physical number of bytes transferred over the network.

       Result -> (structure)
          The result of the task execution.

          PrepareDuration -> (long)
              The  total  time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in the PRE-
              PARING phase.

          PrepareStatus -> (string)
              The status of the PREPARING phase.

          TotalDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync  took  to  transfer
              the file from the source to the destination location.

          TransferDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in the TRANS-
              FERRING phase.

          TransferStatus -> (string)
              The status of the TRANSFERRING phase.

          VerifyDuration -> (long)
              The total time in milliseconds that DataSync spent in the  VERI-
              FYING phase.

          VerifyStatus -> (string)
              The status of the VERIFYING phase.

          ErrorCode -> (string)
              Errors  that  DataSync encountered during execution of the task.
              You can use this error code to help troubleshoot issues.

          ErrorDetail -> (string)
              Detailed description of an error that was encountered during the
              task  execution.  You  can  use  this  information to help trou-
              bleshoot issues.
