DESCRIBE-LOCATION-HDFS()                              DESCRIBE-LOCATION-HDFS()



NAME
       describe-location-hdfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata,  such  as  the  authentication information about the
       Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-hdfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the HDFS cluster location  to  de-
          scribe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the HDFS cluster location.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URI of the HDFS cluster location.

       NameNodes -> (list)
          The NameNode that manage the HDFS namespace.

          (structure)
              The  NameNode  of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The
              NameNode manages the file system's namespace. The NameNode  per-
              forms  operations  such  as opening, closing, and renaming files
              and directories. The NameNode contains the  information  to  map
              blocks of data to the DataNodes.

              Hostname -> (string)
                 The  hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS cluster. This value
                 is the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS)  name  of  the
                 NameNode.  An  agent  that's  installed on-premises uses this
                 hostname to communicate with the NameNode in the network.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the NameNode uses to listen to client requests.

       BlockSize -> (integer)
          The size of the data blocks to write into the HDFS cluster.

       ReplicationFactor -> (integer)
          The number of DataNodes to replicate the data to when writing to the
          HDFS cluster.

       KmsKeyProviderUri -> (string)
          The URI of the HDFS cluster's Key Management Server (KMS).

       QopConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  Quality  of Protection (QOP) configuration specifies the Remote
          Procedure Call (RPC) and data transfer protection  settings  config-
          ured on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster.

          RpcProtection -> (string)
              The  RPC protection setting configured on the HDFS cluster. This
              setting corresponds to  your  hadoop.rpc.protection  setting  in
              your core-site.xml file on your Hadoop cluster.

          DataTransferProtection -> (string)
              The  data  transfer  protection  setting  configured on the HDFS
              cluster. This setting corresponds to your dfs.data.transfer.pro-
              tection  setting  in the hdfs-site.xml file on your Hadoop clus-
              ter.

       AuthenticationType -> (string)
          The type of authentication used to determine  the  identity  of  the
          user.

       SimpleUser -> (string)
          The user name used to identify the client on the host operating sys-
          tem. This parameter is used if the AuthenticationType is defined  as
          SIMPLE .

       KerberosPrincipal -> (string)
          The  Kerberos  principal with access to the files and folders on the
          HDFS cluster. This parameter is used if  the  AuthenticationType  is
          defined as KERBEROS .

       AgentArns -> (list)
          The ARNs of the agents that are used to connect to the HDFS cluster.

          (string)

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the HDFS location was created.
