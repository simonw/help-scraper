OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source HDFS cluster location.

       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the HDFS cluster. This  subdirectory  is  used  to
          read data from or write data to the HDFS cluster.

       --name-nodes (list)
          The  NameNode that manages the HDFS namespace. The NameNode performs
          operations such as opening, closing, and renaming files and directo-
          ries. The NameNode contains the information to map blocks of data to
          the DataNodes. You can use only one NameNode.

          (structure)
              The NameNode of the Hadoop Distributed File System  (HDFS).  The
              NameNode  manages the file system's namespace. The NameNode per-
              forms operations such as opening, closing,  and  renaming  files
              and  directories.  The  NameNode contains the information to map
              blocks of data to the DataNodes.

              Hostname -> (string)
                 The hostname of the NameNode in the HDFS cluster. This  value
                 is  the  IP  address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the
                 NameNode. An agent that's  installed  on-premises  uses  this
                 hostname to communicate with the NameNode in the network.

              Port -> (integer)
                 The port that the NameNode uses to listen to client requests.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Hostname=string,Port=integer ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Hostname": "string",
              "Port": integer
            }
            ...
          ]

       --block-size (integer)
          The size of the data blocks to write into the HDFS cluster.

       --replication-factor (integer)
          The number of DataNodes to replicate the data to when writing to the
          HDFS cluster.

       --kms-key-provider-uri (string)
          The URI of the HDFS cluster's Key Management Server (KMS).

       --qop-configuration (structure)
          The Quality of Protection (QOP) configuration specifies  the  Remote
          Procedure  Call  (RPC) and data transfer privacy settings configured
          on the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) cluster.

          RpcProtection -> (string)
              The RPC protection setting configured on the HDFS cluster.  This
              setting  corresponds  to  your  hadoop.rpc.protection setting in
              your core-site.xml file on your Hadoop cluster.

          DataTransferProtection -> (string)
              The data transfer protection  setting  configured  on  the  HDFS
              cluster. This setting corresponds to your dfs.data.transfer.pro-
              tection setting in the hdfs-site.xml file on your  Hadoop  clus-
              ter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RpcProtection=string,DataTransferProtection=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RpcProtection": "DISABLED"|"AUTHENTICATION"|"INTEGRITY"|"PRIVACY",
            "DataTransferProtection": "DISABLED"|"AUTHENTICATION"|"INTEGRITY"|"PRIVACY"
          }

       --authentication-type (string)
          The  type  of  authentication  used to determine the identity of the
          user.

          Possible values:

          o SIMPLE

          o KERBEROS

       --simple-user (string)
          The user name used to identify the client on the host operating sys-
          tem.

       --kerberos-principal (string)
          The  Kerberos  principal with access to the files and folders on the
          HDFS cluster.

       --kerberos-keytab (blob)
          The Kerberos key table (keytab) that contains mappings  between  the
          defined  Kerberos principal and the encrypted keys. You can load the
          keytab from a file by providing the file's address. If you  use  the
          AWS CLI, it performs base64 encoding for you. Otherwise, provide the
          base64-encoded text.

       --kerberos-krb5-conf (blob)
          The krb5.conf file that contains the Kerberos configuration informa-
          tion.  You  can  load the krb5.conf file by providing the file's ad-
          dress. If you're using the AWS CLI, it performs the base64  encoding
          for you. Otherwise, provide the base64-encoded text.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the agents that are used to connect to the HDFS cluster.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
