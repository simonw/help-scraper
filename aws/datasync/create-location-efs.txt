NAME
       create-location-efs -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates an endpoint for an Amazon EFS file system.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-location-efs
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          --efs-filesystem-arn <value>
          --ec2-config <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          A  subdirectory  in the locations path. This subdirectory in the EFS
          file system is used to read data from the  EFS  source  location  or
          write  data  to  the  EFS destination. By default, DataSync uses the
          root directory.

          NOTE:
              Subdirectory must be specified with forward slashes.  For  exam-
              ple, /path/to/folder .

       --efs-filesystem-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the Amazon EFS file system.

       --ec2-config (structure)
          The  subnet and security group that the Amazon EFS file system uses.
          The security group that you provide needs to be able to  communicate
          with the security group on the mount target in the subnet specified.

          The  exact  relationship between security group M (of the mount tar-
          get) and security group S (which you provide for DataSync to use  at
          this stage) is as follows:

          o Security  group M (which you associate with the mount target) must
            allow inbound access for the Transmission Control  Protocol  (TCP)
            on  the  NFS port (2049) from security group S. You can enable in-
            bound connections either by IP address (CIDR  range)  or  security
            group.

          o Security  group S (provided to DataSync to access EFS) should have
            a rule that enables outbound connections to the NFS port on one of
            the  file  systems  mount targets. You can enable outbound connec-
            tions either by IP address (CIDR range) or security group. For in-
            formation  about  security  groups and mount targets, see Security
            Groups for Amazon EC2 Instances and Mount Targets  in  the  Amazon
            EFS User Guide.

          SubnetArn -> (string)
              The  ARN of the subnet and the security group that DataSync uses
              to access the target EFS file system.

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups that are
              configured for the Amazon EC2 resource.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubnetArn=string,SecurityGroupArns=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubnetArn": "string",
            "SecurityGroupArns": ["string", ...]
          }

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource. The value can be an empty string.  This  value  helps  you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in a list of Amazon Web  Services  re-
              source  tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EFS file  system  loca-
          tion that is created.
