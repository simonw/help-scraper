DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()                                DESCRIBE-LOCATION-NFS()



NAME
       describe-location-nfs -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata, such as the path information, about an NFS location.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-location-nfs
          --location-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the NFS location to describe.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the NFS location that was de-
          scribed.

       LocationUri -> (string)
          The URL of the source NFS location that was described.

       OnPremConfig -> (structure)
          A list of Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for  a  Net-
          work File System (NFS) location.

          AgentArns -> (list)
              ARNs of the agents to use for an NFS location.

              (string)

       MountOptions -> (structure)
          The NFS mount options that DataSync used to mount your NFS share.

          Version -> (string)
              The  specific NFS version that you want DataSync to use to mount
              your NFS share. If the server refuses to use the version  speci-
              fied,  the sync will fail. If you don't specify a version, Data-
              Sync defaults to AUTOMATIC . That is, DataSync automatically se-
              lects a version based on negotiation with the NFS server.

              You can specify the following NFS versions:

              o

                **
                NFSv3  **  -  stateless protocol version that allows for asyn-
                chronous writes on the server.

              o

                **
                NFSv4.0 ** - stateful, firewall-friendly protocol version that
                supports delegations and pseudo file systems.

              o

                **
                NFSv4.1 ** - stateful protocol version that supports sessions,
                directory delegations, and parallel data  processing.  Version
                4.1 also includes all features available in version 4.0.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the NFS location was created.
