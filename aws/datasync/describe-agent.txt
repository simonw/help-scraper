DESCRIBE-AGENT()                                              DESCRIBE-AGENT()



NAME
       describe-agent -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns metadata such as the name, the network interfaces, and the sta-
       tus (that is, whether the agent is running or not)  for  an  agent.  To
       specify  which agent to describe, use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
       the agent in your request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-agent
          --agent-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --agent-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent to describe.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AgentArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the agent.

       Name -> (string)
          The name of the agent.

       Status -> (string)
          The  status of the agent. If the status is ONLINE, then the agent is
          configured properly and is available to use. The Running  status  is
          the  normal  running  status for an agent. If the status is OFFLINE,
          the agent's VM is turned off or the agent is in an unhealthy  state.
          When  the  issue  that  caused  the unhealthy state is resolved, the
          agent returns to ONLINE status.

       LastConnectionTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the agent last connected to DataSync.

       CreationTime -> (timestamp)
          The time that the agent was activated (that is, created in your  ac-
          count).

       EndpointType -> (string)
          The  type  of  endpoint that your agent is connected to. If the end-
          point is a VPC endpoint, the agent is not accessible over the public
          internet.

       PrivateLinkConfig -> (structure)
          The subnet and the security group that DataSync used to access a VPC
          endpoint.

          VpcEndpointId -> (string)
              The ID of the VPC endpoint that is configured for an  agent.  An
              agent  that is configured with a VPC endpoint will not be acces-
              sible over the public internet.

          PrivateLinkEndpoint -> (string)
              The private endpoint that is configured for an  agent  that  has
              access  to IP addresses in a PrivateLink . An agent that is con-
              figured with this endpoint will not be accessible over the  pub-
              lic internet.

          SubnetArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the subnets that are config-
              ured for an agent activated in a VPC or an agent that has access
              to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)

          SecurityGroupArns -> (list)
              The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the security groups that are
              configured for the EC2 resource that hosts an agent activated in
              a VPC or an agent that has access to a VPC endpoint.

              (string)
