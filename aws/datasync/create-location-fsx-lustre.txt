          --security-group-arns <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]

OPTIONS
       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the FSx for Lustre file system.

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Names  (ARNs) of the security groups that are
          used to configure the FSx for Lustre file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the location's path. This subdirectory in the  FSx
          for  Lustre file system is used to read data from the FSx for Lustre
          source location or write data to the FSx for Lustre destination.

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource.  The  value  can  be an empty string. This value helps you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for Lustre file system lo-
          cation that's created.
