SYNOPSIS
            create-location-s3
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          --s3-bucket-arn <value>
          [--s3-storage-class <value>]
          --s3-config <value>
          [--agent-arns <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the Amazon S3 bucket. This subdirectory in  Amazon
          S3 is used to read data from the S3 source location or write data to
          the S3 destination.

       --s3-bucket-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Amazon S3 bucket. If the bucket is on an  Amazon  Web
          Services Outpost, this must be an access point ARN.

       --s3-storage-class (string)
          The  Amazon  S3  storage  class that you want to store your files in
          when this location is used as a task  destination.  For  buckets  in
          Amazon Web Services Regions, the storage class defaults to Standard.
          For buckets on Outposts, the storage class defaults  to  Amazon  Web
          Services S3 Outposts.

          For more information about S3 storage classes, see Amazon S3 Storage
          Classes . Some storage classes have behaviors that can  affect  your
          S3  storage  cost. For detailed information, see Considerations when
          working with S3 storage classes in DataSync .

          Possible values:

          o STANDARD

          o STANDARD_IA

          o ONEZONE_IA

          o INTELLIGENT_TIERING

          o GLACIER

          o DEEP_ARCHIVE

          o OUTPOSTS

       --s3-config (structure)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that is used to access an Amazon S3 bucket.

          For detailed information about using such a role, see Creating a Lo-
          cation for Amazon S3 in the DataSync User Guide .

          BucketAccessRoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon S3 bucket to access. This bucket is used as a parame-
              ter in the CreateLocationS3 operation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          BucketAccessRoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "BucketAccessRoleArn": "string"
          }

       --agent-arns (list)
          If you are using DataSync on an Amazon Web Services Outpost, specify
          the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the DataSync agents deployed  on
          your  Outpost. For more information about launching a DataSync agent
          on an Amazon Web Services Outpost, see Deploy your DataSync agent on
          Outposts .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair that represents the tag that you want to add to
          the location. The value can be an empty string. We  recommend  using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the source Amazon S3 bucket loca-
          tion that is created.
