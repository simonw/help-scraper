OPTIONS
       --subdirectory (string)
          A subdirectory in the location's path. This subdirectory in the Ama-
          zon  FSx  for  Windows  File Server file system is used to read data
          from the Amazon FSx for Windows File Server source location or write
          data to the FSx for Windows File Server destination.

       --fsx-filesystem-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) for the FSx for Windows File Server
          file system.

       --security-group-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the  security  groups  that  are
          used to configure the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents a tag that you want to add to the
          resource. The value can be an empty string.  This  value  helps  you
          manage, filter, and search for your resources. We recommend that you
          create a name tag for your location.

          (structure)
              Represents a single entry in a list of Amazon Web  Services  re-
              source  tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --user (string)
          The user who has the permissions to access files and folders in  the
          FSx for Windows File Server file system.

          For  information  about choosing a user name that ensures sufficient
          permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .

       --domain (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the FSx for Windows File  Server
          belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user who has the permissions to access files and
          folders in the FSx for Windows File Server file system.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the FSx for  Windows  File  Server
          file system location that is created.
