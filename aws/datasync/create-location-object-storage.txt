OPTIONS
       --server-hostname (string)
          The  name  of  the self-managed object storage server. This value is
          the IP address or Domain Name Service (DNS) name of the object stor-
          age  server. An agent uses this hostname to mount the object storage
          server in a network.

       --server-port (integer)
          The port that your self-managed object storage  server  accepts  in-
          bound  network  traffic on. The server port is set by default to TCP
          80 (HTTP) or TCP 443 (HTTPS). You can specify a custom port if  your
          self-managed object storage server requires one.

       --server-protocol (string)
          The  protocol  that  the  object storage server uses to communicate.
          Valid values are HTTP or HTTPS.

          Possible values:

          o HTTPS

          o HTTP

       --subdirectory (string)
          The subdirectory in the self-managed object storage server  that  is
          used to read data from.

       --bucket-name (string)
          The bucket on the self-managed object storage server that is used to
          read data from.

       --access-key (string)
          Optional. The access key is used if credentials are required to  ac-
          cess  the self-managed object storage server. If your object storage
          requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey and
          SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --secret-key (string)
          Optional.  The secret key is used if credentials are required to ac-
          cess the self-managed object storage server. If your object  storage
          requires a user name and password to authenticate, use AccessKey and
          SecretKey to provide the user name and password, respectively.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  agents  associated  with  the
          self-managed object storage server location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value  pair that represents the tag that you want to add to
          the location. The value can be an empty string. We  recommend  using
          tags to name your resources.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single entry in a list of Amazon Web Services re-
              source tags. TagListEntry returns an array that contains a  list
              of tasks when the ListTagsForResource operation is called.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for an Amazon Web Services resource tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       LocationArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  agents  associated  with  the
          self-managed object storage server location.
