NAME
       update-location-smb -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  some  of  the  parameters of a previously created location for
       Server Message Block (SMB) file system access.  For  information  about
       creating an SMB location, see Creating a location for SMB .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-location-smb
          --location-arn <value>
          [--subdirectory <value>]
          [--user <value>]
          [--domain <value>]
          [--password <value>]
          [--agent-arns <value>]
          [--mount-options <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --location-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the SMB location to update.

       --subdirectory (string)
          The  subdirectory  in  the SMB file system that is used to read data
          from the SMB source location or write data to the  SMB  destination.
          The  SMB path should be a path that's exported by the SMB server, or
          a subdirectory of that path. The path should be such that it can  be
          mounted by other SMB clients in your network.

          NOTE:
              Subdirectory  must  be specified with forward slashes. For exam-
              ple, /path/to/folder .

          To transfer all the data in the folder that you specified,  DataSync
          must  have  permissions to mount the SMB share and to access all the
          data in that share. To ensure this, do either of the following:

          o Ensure that the user/password specified belongs to  the  user  who
            can  mount  the  share and who has the appropriate permissions for
            all of the files and directories that you want DataSync to access.

          o Use credentials of a member of the Backup Operators group to mount
            the share.

          Doing  either of these options enables the agent to access the data.
          For the agent to access directories, you must also enable  all  exe-
          cute access.

       --user (string)
          The user who can mount the share has the permissions to access files
          and folders in the SMB share.

       --domain (string)
          The name of the Windows domain that the SMB server belongs to.

       --password (string)
          The password of the user who can mount the share has the permissions
          to access files and folders in the SMB share.

       --agent-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of agents to use for a Simple Mes-
          sage Block (SMB) location.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --mount-options (structure)
          Represents the mount options that are available for DataSync to  ac-
          cess an SMB location.

          Version -> (string)
              The  specific SMB version that you want DataSync to use to mount
              your SMB share. If you don't specify  a  version,  DataSync  de-
              faults  to AUTOMATIC . That is, DataSync automatically selects a
              version based on negotiation with the SMB server.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Version": "AUTOMATIC"|"SMB2"|"SMB3"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
