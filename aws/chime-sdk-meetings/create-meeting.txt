       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
