              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-

              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires
              when  the meeting ends, or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the

                 cation.

          a list of the attendees is returned, along with error codes and  er-
          ror messages.

              the BatchCreateAttendee and  CreateAttendee  actions.  This  in-
              cludes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.
