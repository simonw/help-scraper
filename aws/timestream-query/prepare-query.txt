PREPARE-QUERY()                                                PREPARE-QUERY()



NAME
       prepare-query -

DESCRIPTION
       A  synchronous operation that allows you to submit a query with parame-
       ters to be stored by Timestream for later running. Timestream only sup-
       ports  using  this  operation with the PrepareQueryRequest$ValidateOnly
       set to true .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            prepare-query
          --query-string <value>
          [--validate-only | --no-validate-only]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The Timestream query string that you  want  to  use  as  a  prepared
          statement.  Parameter  names  can be specified in the query string @
          character followed by an identifier.

       --validate-only | --no-validate-only (boolean)
          By setting this value to true , Timestream will only  validate  that
          the query string is a valid Timestream query, and not store the pre-
          pared query for later use.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
