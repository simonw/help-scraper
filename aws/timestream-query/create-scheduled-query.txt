CREATE-SCHEDULED-QUERY()                              CREATE-SCHEDULED-QUERY()



NAME
       create-scheduled-query -

DESCRIPTION
       Create a scheduled query that will be run on your behalf at the config-
       ured schedule. Timestream assumes the execution role provided  as  part
       of  the  ScheduledQueryExecutionRoleArn parameter to run the query. You
       can use the NotificationConfiguration parameter to configure  notifica-
       tion for your scheduled query operations.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-scheduled-query
          --name <value>
          --query-string <value>
          --schedule-configuration <value>
          --notification-configuration <value>
          [--target-configuration <value>]
          [--client-token <value>]
          --scheduled-query-execution-role-arn <value>
          [--tags <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          --error-report-configuration <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Name of the scheduled query.

       --query-string (string)
          The  query  string  to  run. Parameter names can be specified in the
          query string @ character followed by an identifier. The named Param-
          eter  @scheduled_runtime is reserved and can be used in the query to
          get the time at which the query is scheduled to run.

          The timestamp calculated according to the ScheduleConfiguration  pa-
          rameter,  will be the value of @scheduled_runtime paramater for each
          query run. For example, consider an instance of  a  scheduled  query
          executing  on  2021-12-01  00:00:00.  For this instance, the @sched-
          uled_runtime parameter is initialized to  the  timestamp  2021-12-01
          00:00:00 when invoking the query.

       --schedule-configuration (structure)
          The schedule configuration for the query.

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)

       --notification-configuration (structure)
          Notification configuration for the scheduled query.  A  notification
          is  sent  by Timestream when a query run finishes, when the state is
          updated or when you delete it.

          SnsConfiguration -> (structure)

       --client-token (string)
          Using a ClientToken makes the call to  CreateScheduledQuery  idempo-
          tent,  in  other words, making the same request repeatedly will pro-
          duce the same result. Making multiple identical CreateScheduledQuery
          requests has the same effect as making a single request.

          o If  CreateScheduledQuery  is  called  without  a ClientToken , the
            Query SDK generates a ClientToken on your behalf.

          o After 8 hours, any request with the same ClientToken is treated as
            a new request.

       --scheduled-query-execution-role-arn (string)
          The  ARN  for  the IAM role that Timestream will assume when running
          the scheduled query.

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to label the scheduled query.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. Tags enable you to categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the tag. Tag values are case sensitive and can
                 be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The Amazon KMS key used to encrypt  the  scheduled  query  resource,
          at-rest. If the Amazon KMS key is not specified, the scheduled query
          resource will be encrypted with a Timestream owned Amazon  KMS  key.
          To  specify a KMS key, use the key ID, key ARN, alias name, or alias
          ARN. When using an alias name, prefix the name with alias/

          If ErrorReportConfiguration uses SSE_KMS  as  encryption  type,  the
          same KmsKeyId is used to encrypt the error report at rest.

       --error-report-configuration (structure)
          Configuration  for  error reporting. Error reports will be generated
          when a problem is encountered when writing the query results.

          S3Configuration -> (structure)
              The S3 configuration for the error reports.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 Name of the S3 bucket under which error reports will be  cre-
                 ated.

              ObjectKeyPrefix -> (string)
                 Prefix  for  the error report key. Timestream by default adds
                 the following prefix to the error report path.

              EncryptionOption -> (string)
                 Encryption at rest options for the error reports. If  no  en-
                 cryption  option  is specified, Timestream will choose SSE_S3
                 as default.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Configuration={BucketName=string,ObjectKeyPrefix=string,EncryptionOption=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Configuration": {
              "BucketName": "string",
              "ObjectKeyPrefix": "string",
              "EncryptionOption": "SSE_S3"|"SSE_KMS"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Arn -> (string)
          ARN for the created scheduled query.
