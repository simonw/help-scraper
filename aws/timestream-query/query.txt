QUERY()                                                                QUERY()



NAME
       query -

DESCRIPTION
          Query  is  a  synchronous  operation that enables you to run a query
          against your Amazon Timestream data. Query will time  out  after  60
          seconds. You must update the default timeout in the SDK to support a
          timeout of 60 seconds. See the code sample for details.

       Your query request will fail in the following cases:

       o If you submit a Query request with the same client token  outside  of
         the 5-minute idempotency window.

       o If  you submit a Query request with the same client token, but change
         other parameters, within the 5-minute idempotency window.

       o If the size of the row (including the query metadata) exceeds  1  MB,
         then  the  query  will fail with the following error message:   Query
         aborted as max page response size has been exceeded by the output re-
         sult row

       o If the IAM principal of the query initiator and the result reader are
         not the same and/or the query initiator and the result reader do  not
         have the same query string in the query requests, the query will fail
         with an Invalid pagination token error.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       query is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in or-
       der to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagina-
       tion by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text
       and  the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query argument
       must extract data from the results of the following query  expressions:
       Rows

SYNOPSIS
            query
          --query-string <value>
          [--client-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --query-string (string)
          The query to be run by Timestream.

       --client-token (string)
          Unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters specified
          when a Query request is made. Providing a ClientToken makes the call
          to  Query   idempotent  . This means that running the same query re-
          peatedly will produce the same result. In other words, making multi-
          ple  identical Query requests has the same effect as making a single
          request. When using ClientToken in a query, note the following:

          o If the Query API is instantiated without a ClientToken , the Query
            SDK generates a ClientToken on your behalf.

          o If the Query invocation only contains the ClientToken but does not
            include a NextToken , that invocation of Query is assumed to be  a
            new query run.

          o If  the invocation contains NextToken , that particular invocation
            is assumed to be a subsequent invocation of a prior  call  to  the
            Query API, and a result set is returned.

          o After 4 hours, any request with the same ClientToken is treated as
            a new request.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        can  be a scalar or complex. Scalar data types are in-
                        tegers, strings, doubles, Booleans, and  others.  Com-
                        plex  data  types  are types such as arrays, rows, and
                        others.

                        ScalarType -> (string)
                            Indicates if the column is of type  string,  inte-
                            ger, Boolean, double, timestamp, date, time.

                        (  ...  recursive ... )( ... recursive ... )RowColumn-
                        Info -> (list)
                            Indicates if the column is a row.

                            ( ... recursive ... )

                 RowColumnInfo -> (list)
                     Indicates if the column is a row.

                     (structure)
                        Contains the metadata for query results  such  as  the
                        column names, data types, and other attributes.

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the result set column. The name of the
                            result set is available for columns  of  all  data
                            types except for arrays.

                        Type -> (structure)
                            The  data  type of the result set column. The data
                            type can be a scalar or complex. Scalar data types
                            are integers, strings, doubles, Booleans, and oth-
                            ers. Complex data types are types such as  arrays,
                            rows, and others.

                            ScalarType -> (string)
                               Indicates  if the column is of type string, in-
                               teger, Boolean, double, timestamp, date, time.

                            ( ... recursive ... )( ... recursive ... )

       QueryStatus -> (structure)
          Information about the status of the query,  including  progress  and
          bytes scanned.

          ProgressPercentage -> (double)
              The progress of the query, expressed as a percentage.

          CumulativeBytesScanned -> (long)
              The  amount of data scanned by the query in bytes. This is a cu-
              mulative sum and represents the total amount  of  bytes  scanned
              since the query was started.

          CumulativeBytesMetered -> (long)
              The  amount  of data scanned by the query in bytes that you will
              be charged for. This is a cumulative sum and represents the  to-
              tal  amount of data that you will be charged for since the query
              was started. The charge is applied only once and is  either  ap-
              plied when the query completes running or when the query is can-
              celled.
