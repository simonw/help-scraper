SYNOPSIS
            set-platform-application-attributes
          --platform-application-arn <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn for SetPlatformApplicationAttributes action.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of the platform application attributes. Attributes in this map
          include the following:

          o PlatformCredential   The credential received from the notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformCredential is client secret.

            o For Apple Services using certificate  credentials,  PlatformCre-
              dential is private key.

            o For  Apple  Services using token credentials, PlatformCredential
              is signing key.

            o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging),  PlatformCredential  is  API
              key.

          o PlatformPrincipal   The  principal  received from the notification
            service.

            o For ADM, PlatformPrincipal is client id.

            o For Apple Services using certificate credentials,  PlatformPrin-
              cipal is SSL certificate.

            o For Apple Services using token credentials, PlatformPrincipal is
              signing key ID.

            o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no  PlatformPrinci-
              pal .

          o EventEndpointCreated  Topic ARN to which EndpointCreated event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointDeleted  Topic ARN to which EndpointDeleted event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventEndpointUpdated   Topic ARN to which EndpointUpdate event no-
            tifications are sent.

          o EventDeliveryFailure  Topic ARN to which DeliveryFailure event no-
            tifications  are sent upon Direct Publish delivery failure (perma-
            nent) to one of the application's endpoints.

          o SuccessFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o FailureFeedbackRoleArn  IAM role ARN used to give Amazon SNS write
            access to use CloudWatch Logs on your behalf.

          o SuccessFeedbackSampleRate  Sample rate percentage (0-100) of  suc-
            cessfully delivered messages.

          The  following attributes only apply to APNs token-based authentica-
          tion:

          o ApplePlatformTeamID  The identifier that's assigned to your  Apple
            developer account team.

          o ApplePlatformBundleID   The  bundle  identifier that's assigned to
            your iOS app.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To set platform application attributes

       The  following  set-platform-application-attributes  example  sets  the
       EventDeliveryFailure  attribute  for the specified platform application
       to the ARN of the specified Amazon SNS topic.

          aws sns set-platform-application-attributes \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication \
              --attributes EventDeliveryFailure=arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:AnotherTopic

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
