CREATE-TOPIC()                                                  CREATE-TOPIC()



NAME
       create-topic -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a topic to which notifications can be published. Users can cre-
       ate at most 100,000 standard topics (at most 1,000  FIFO  topics).  For
       more  information,  see  Creating an Amazon SNS topic in the Amazon SNS
       Developer Guide . This action is idempotent, so if  the  requester  al-
       ready  owns  a  topic  with the specified name, that topic's ARN is re-
       turned without creating a new topic.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-topic
          --name <value>
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the topic you want to create.

          Constraints: Topic names must be made up of only uppercase and  low-
          ercase ASCII letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and must be
          between 1 and 256 characters long.

          For a FIFO (first-in-first-out) topic, the name must  end  with  the
          .fifo suffix.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the CreateTopic action uses:

          o DeliveryPolicy  The policy that defines  how  Amazon  SNS  retries
            failed deliveries to HTTP/S endpoints.

          o DisplayName   The  display  name  to use for a topic with SMS sub-
            scriptions.

          o FifoTopic  Set to true to create a FIFO topic.

          o Policy  The policy that defines who can access your topic. By  de-
            fault, only the topic owner can publish or subscribe to the topic.

          The following attribute applies only to server-side encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SNS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion, see Key Terms . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Man-
            agement Service API Reference .

          The following attributes apply only to FIFO topics :

          o FifoTopic  When this is set to true , a FIFO topic is created.

          o ContentBasedDeduplication  Enables content-based deduplication for
            FIFO topics.

            o By  default,  ContentBasedDeduplication is set to false . If you
              create a FIFO topic and this attribute is false , you must spec-
              ify  a  value  for  the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for the
              Publish action.

            o When you set ContentBasedDeduplication to true , Amazon SNS uses
              a  SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId using the
              body of the message (but not the  attributes  of  the  message).
              (Optional)  To  override  the generated value, you can specify a
              value for the MessageDeduplicationId parameter for  the  Publish
              action.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --tags (list)
          The list of tags to add to a new topic.

          NOTE:
              To  be  able  to  tag  a  topic  on  creation, you must have the
              sns:CreateTopic and sns:TagResource permissions.

          (structure)
              The list of tags to be added to the specified topic.

              Key -> (string)
                 The required key portion of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The optional value portion of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an SNS topic

       The following create-topic example creates an SNS topic named my-topic.

          aws sns create-topic \
              --name my-topic

              "ResponseMetadata": {

              },
              "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic"
          }

       Amazon SQS and Amazon SNS in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TopicArn -> (string)
