LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-OPTED-OUT()                  LIST-PHONE-NUMBERS-OPTED-OUT()



NAME
       list-phone-numbers-opted-out -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of phone numbers that are opted out, meaning you cannot
       send SMS messages to them.

       The results for ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut are paginated, and  each  page
       returns up to 100 phone numbers. If additional phone numbers are avail-
       able after the first page of results, then a NextToken string  will  be
       returned.  To  receive the next page, you call ListPhoneNumbersOptedOut
       again using the NextToken string received from the previous call.  When
       there are no more records to return, NextToken will be null.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-phone-numbers-opted-out  is  a  paginated  operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: phoneNumbers

SYNOPSIS
            list-phone-numbers-opted-out
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
