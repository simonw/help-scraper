NAME
       list-endpoints-by-platform-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the endpoints and endpoint attributes for devices in a supported
       push notification service, such as GCM (Firebase Cloud  Messaging)  and
       APNS.  The results for ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication are paginated
       and return a limited list  of  endpoints,  up  to  100.  If  additional
       records  are  available  after the first page results, then a NextToken
       string will be returned. To receive the next page,  you  call  ListEnd-
       pointsByPlatformApplication  again  using the NextToken string received
       from the previous call. When there are no more records to return, Next-
       Token  will  be null. For more information, see Using Amazon SNS Mobile
       Push Notifications .

       This action is throttled at 30 transactions per second (TPS).

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-endpoints-by-platform-application is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  ar-
       gument.   When  using --output text and the --query argument on a pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Endpoints

SYNOPSIS
            list-endpoints-by-platform-application
          --platform-application-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --platform-application-arn (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn  for  ListEndpointsByPlatformApplicationInput
          action.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list the endpoints for a platform application

       The following list-endpoints-by-platform-application example lists  the
       endpoints  and  endpoint attributes for the specified platform applica-
       tion.

          aws sns list-endpoints-by-platform-application \
              --platform-application-arn arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication

       Output:

          {
              "Endpoints": [
                  {
                      "Attributes": {
                          "Token": "EXAMPLE12345...,
                          "Enabled": "true"
                      },
                      "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:endpoint/GCM/MyApplication/12345678-abcd-9012-efgh-345678901234"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Endpoints -> (list)
          Endpoints returned for ListEndpointsByPlatformApplication action.

          (structure)
              The endpoint for mobile app and device.

              EndpointArn -> (string)
                 The EndpointArn for mobile app and device.

              Attributes -> (map)

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          NextToken string is returned when calling ListEndpointsByPlatformAp-
          plication action if additional records are available after the first
          page results.
