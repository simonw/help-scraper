LIST-PLATFORM-APPLICATIONS()                      LIST-PLATFORM-APPLICATIONS()



NAME
       list-platform-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the platform application objects for the supported push notifica-
       tion services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging). The re-
       sults  for  ListPlatformApplications are paginated and return a limited
       list of applications, up to 100. If additional  records  are  available
       after the first page results, then a NextToken string will be returned.
       To receive the next page, you call ListPlatformApplications  using  the
       NextToken  string  received  from  the previous call. When there are no
       more records to return, NextToken will be null. For  more  information,
       see Using Amazon SNS Mobile Push Notifications .

       This action is throttled at 15 transactions per second (TPS).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-platform-applications is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: PlatformApplications

SYNOPSIS
            list-platform-applications
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
