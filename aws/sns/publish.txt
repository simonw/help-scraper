PUBLISH()                                                            PUBLISH()



NAME
       publish -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends  a  message  to an Amazon SNS topic, a text message (SMS message)
       directly to a phone number, or a message to a mobile platform  endpoint
       (when you specify the TargetArn ).

       If  you  send  a message to a topic, Amazon SNS delivers the message to
       each endpoint that is subscribed to the topic. The format of  the  mes-
       sage depends on the notification protocol for each subscribed endpoint.

       When a messageId is returned, the message is saved and Amazon SNS imme-
       diately delivers it to subscribers.

       To use the Publish action for publishing a message  to  a  mobile  end-
       point,  such  as  an  app  on a Kindle device or mobile phone, you must
       specify the EndpointArn for the TargetArn parameter. The EndpointArn is
       returned when making a call with the CreatePlatformEndpoint action.

       For  more  information about formatting messages, see Send Custom Plat-
       form-Specific Payloads in Messages to Mobile Devices .

       WARNING:
          You can publish messages only to topics and endpoints  in  the  same
          Amazon Web Services Region.

OPTIONS
       --topic-arn (string)
          The topic you want to publish to.

          If  you  don't  specify a value for the TopicArn parameter, you must
          specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TargetArn parameters.

       --target-arn (string)
          If you don't specify a value for the TargetArn parameter,  you  must
          specify a value for the PhoneNumber or TopicArn parameters.

       --phone-number (string)
          The  phone  number  to which you want to deliver an SMS message. Use
          E.164 format.

          If you don't specify a value for the PhoneNumber parameter, you must
          specify a value for the TargetArn or TopicArn parameters.

       --message (string)
          The message you want to send.

          If  you are publishing to a topic and you want to send the same mes-
          sage to all transport protocols, include the text of the message  as
          a  String  value.  If  you  want to send different messages for each
          transport protocol, set the value of the MessageStructure  parameter
          to json and use a JSON object for the Message parameter.

          Constraints:

          o With  the exception of SMS, messages must be UTF-8 encoded strings
            and at most 256 KB in size (262,144  bytes,  not  262,144  charac-
            ters).

          o For SMS, each message can contain up to 140 characters. This char-
            acter limit depends on the encoding schema. For  example,  an  SMS
            message  can  contain 160 GSM characters, 140 ASCII characters, or
            70 UCS-2 characters. If you publish a message  that  exceeds  this
            size  limit,  Amazon  SNS  sends the message as multiple messages,
            each fitting within the  size  limit.  Messages  aren't  truncated
            mid-word  but are cut off at whole-word boundaries. The total size
            limit for a single SMS Publish action is 1,600 characters.

          JSON-specific constraints:

          o Keys in the JSON object that  correspond  to  supported  transport
            protocols must have simple JSON string values.

          o The values will be parsed (unescaped) before they are used in out-
            going messages.

          o Outbound notifications are JSON encoded (meaning that the  charac-
            ters will be reescaped for sending).

          o Values  have  a  minimum length of 0 (the empty string, "", is al-
            lowed).

          o Values have a maximum length bounded by the overall  message  size
            (so, including multiple protocols may limit message sizes).

          o Non-string values will cause the key to be ignored.

          o Keys  that  do not correspond to supported transport protocols are
            ignored.

          o Duplicate keys are not allowed.

          o Failure to parse or validate any key or value in the message  will
            cause the Publish call to return an error (no partial delivery).

       --subject (string)
          Optional parameter to be used as the "Subject" line when the message
          is delivered to email endpoints. This field will also  be  included,
          if  present,  in  the standard JSON messages delivered to other end-
          points.

          Constraints: Subjects must be ASCII text that begins with a  letter,
          number, or punctuation mark; must not include line breaks or control
          characters; and must be less than 100 characters long.

       --message-structure (string)
          Set MessageStructure to json if you want to send a different message
          for  each  protocol.  For example, using one publish action, you can
          send a short message to your SMS subscribers and a longer message to
          your  email  subscribers.  If you set MessageStructure to json , the
          value of the Message parameter must:

          o be a syntactically valid JSON object; and

          o contain at least a top-level JSON key of "default"  with  a  value
            that is a string.

          You can define other top-level keys that define the message you want
          to send to a specific transport protocol (e.g., "http").

          Valid value: json

       --message-attributes (map)
          Message attributes for Publish action.

          Name -> (string)

          Value -> (structure)
              The user-specified message  attribute  value.  For  string  data
              types, the value attribute has the same restrictions on the con-
              tent as the message body. For more information, see Publish .

              Name, type, and value must not be empty or  null.  In  addition,
              the  message  body should not be empty or null. All parts of the
              message attribute, including name, type, and value, are included
              in  the  message  size  restriction,  which  is currently 256 KB
              (262,144 bytes). For more information, see  Amazon  SNS  message
              attributes  and  Publishing  to a mobile phone in the Amazon SNS
              Developer Guide.

              DataType -> (string)
                 Amazon SNS supports the following logical data types: String,
                 String.Array,  Number,  and Binary. For more information, see
                 Message Attribute Data Types .

              StringValue -> (string)
                 Strings are Unicode with UTF8 binary encoding. For a list  of
                 code values, see ASCII Printable Characters .

              BinaryValue -> (blob)
                 Binary  type  attributes can store any binary data, for exam-
                 ple, compressed data, encrypted data, or images.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=DataType=string,StringValue=string,BinaryValue=blob,KeyName2=DataType=string,StringValue=string,BinaryValue=blob

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": {
                "DataType": "string",
                "StringValue": "string",
                "BinaryValue": blob
              }
            ...}

       --message-deduplication-id (string)
          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The
          MessageDeduplicationId can contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters
          (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~) .

          Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId , which is a
          token  used  for deduplication of sent messages. If a message with a
          particular MessageDeduplicationId is sent successfully, any  message
          sent  with the same MessageDeduplicationId during the 5-minute dedu-
          plication interval is treated as a duplicate.

          If the topic has ContentBasedDeduplication set, the system generates
          a  MessageDeduplicationId based on the contents of the message. Your
          MessageDeduplicationId overrides the generated one.

       --message-group-id (string)
          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) topics. The
          MessageGroupId  can  contain up to 128 alphanumeric characters (a-z,
          A-Z, 0-9) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~) .

          The MessageGroupId is a tag that specifies that a message belongs to
          a  specific  message group. Messages that belong to the same message
          group are processed in a FIFO manner (however, messages in different
          message  groups might be processed out of order). Every message must
          include a MessageGroupId .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To publish a message to a topic

       The following publish example publishes the specified  message  to  the
       specified  SNS topic. The message comes from a text file, which enables
       you to include line breaks.

          aws sns publish \
              --topic-arn "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:my-topic" \
              --message file://message.txt

       Contents of message.txt:

          Hello World
          Second Line

       Output:

          {
              "MessageId": "123a45b6-7890-12c3-45d6-111122223333"
          }

       Example 2: To publish an SMS message to a phone number

       The following publish example publishes the message Hello world! to the
       phone number +1-555-555-0100.

          aws sns publish \
              --message "Hello world!" \
              --phone-number +1-555-555-0100

       Output:

          {
              "MessageId": "123a45b6-7890-12c3-45d6-333322221111"
          }

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          Unique identifier assigned to the published message.

          Length Constraint: Maximum 100 characters

       SequenceNumber -> (string)
          This response element applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) top-
          ics.

          The sequence number is a large, non-consecutive number  that  Amazon
          SNS  assigns  to  each  message. The length of SequenceNumber is 128
          bits. SequenceNumber continues to increase for each MessageGroupId .
