CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()                    CREATE-PLATFORM-APPLICATION()



NAME
       create-platform-application -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a platform application object for one of the supported push no-
       tification services, such as APNS and GCM (Firebase  Cloud  Messaging),
       to  which  devices and mobile apps may register. You must specify Plat-
       formPrincipal and PlatformCredential attributes  when  using  the  Cre-
       atePlatformApplication action.
          PlatformPrincipal and PlatformCredential are received from the noti-
          fication service.

       o For ADM , PlatformPrincipal is client id  and  PlatformCredential  is
         client secret .

       o For  Baidu  ,  PlatformPrincipal is API key and PlatformCredential is
         secret key .

       o For APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using  certificate  credentials,  Platform-
         Principal is SSL certificate and PlatformCredential is private key .

       o For  APNS and APNS_SANDBOX using token credentials, PlatformPrincipal
         is signing key ID and PlatformCredential is signing key .

       o For GCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging), there is no PlatformPrincipal and
         the PlatformCredential is API key .

       o For  MPNS  , PlatformPrincipal is TLS certificate and PlatformCreden-
         tial is private key .

       o For WNS , PlatformPrincipal is Package Security Identifier and  Plat-
         formCredential is secret key .

       You can use the returned PlatformApplicationArn as an attribute for the
       CreatePlatformEndpoint action.

SYNOPSIS
            create-platform-application
          --name <value>
          --platform <value>
          --attributes <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          Application names must be made up of only  uppercase  and  lowercase
          ASCII  letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods, and must
          be between 1 and 256 characters long.

       --platform (string)
          The following platforms are supported: ADM  (Amazon  Device  Messag-
          ing),  APNS (Apple Push Notification Service), APNS_SANDBOX, and GCM
          (Firebase Cloud Messaging).

       --attributes (map)
          For a list of attributes, see SetPlatformApplicationAttributes .

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a platform application

       The following  create-platform-application  example  creates  a  Google
       Firebase platform application using the specified platform credential.

          aws sns create-platform-application \
              --name MyApplication \
              --platform GCM \
              --attributes PlatformCredential=EXAMPLEabcd12345jklm67890stuv12345bcdef

       Output:

          {
              "PlatformApplicationArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:app/GCM/MyApplication"
          }

OUTPUT
       PlatformApplicationArn -> (string)
          PlatformApplicationArn is returned.
