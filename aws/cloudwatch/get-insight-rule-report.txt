NAME
       get-insight-rule-report -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation returns the time series data collected by a Contributor
       Insights rule. The data includes the identity and number  of  contribu-
       tors to the log group.

       You  can  also optionally return one or more statistics about each data
       point in the time series. These statistics can include the following:

       o UniqueContributors -- the number of unique contributors for each data
         point.

       o MaxContributorValue -- the value of the top contributor for each data
         point. The identity of the contributor might  change  for  each  data
         point  in  the  graph. If this rule aggregates by COUNT, the top con-
         tributor for each data point is the contributor with the most  occur-
         rences  in  that  period. If the rule aggregates by SUM, the top con-
         tributor is the contributor with the highest sum  in  the  log  field
         specified by the rule's Value , during that period.

       o SampleCount -- the number of data points matched by the rule.

       o Sum  --  the  sum of the values from all contributors during the time
         period represented by that data point.

       o Minimum -- the minimum value from a  single  observation  during  the
         time period represented by that data point.

       o Maximum  --  the  maximum  value from a single observation during the
         time period represented by that data point.

       o Average -- the average value from all contributors  during  the  time
         period represented by that data point.

OPTIONS
       --rule-name (string)
          The name of the rule that you want to see data from.

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The  start time of the data to use in the report. When used in a raw
          HTTP Query API, it is formatted as yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss . For exam-
          ple, 2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The  end  time  of the data to use in the report. When used in a raw
          HTTP Query API, it is formatted as yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss . For exam-
          ple, 2019-07-01T23:59:59 .

       --period (integer)
          The  period,  in  seconds,  to  use  for  the  statistics in the In-
          sightRuleMetricDatapoint results.

       --max-contributor-count (integer)
          The maximum number of contributors to include  in  the  report.  The
          range is 1 to 100. If you omit this, the default of 10 is used.

       --metrics (list)
          Specifies which metrics to use for aggregation of contributor values
          for the report. You can specify one or more of  the  following  met-
          rics:

          o UniqueContributors  --  the number of unique contributors for each
            data point.

          o MaxContributorValue -- the value of the top contributor  for  each
            data  point. The identity of the contributor might change for each
            data point in the graph. If this rule aggregates by COUNT, the top
            contributor  for  each data point is the contributor with the most
            occurrences in that period. If the rule aggregates by SUM, the top
            contributor  is  the  contributor  with the highest sum in the log
            field specified by the rule's Value , during that period.

          o SampleCount -- the number of data points matched by the rule.

          o Sum -- the sum of the values from all contributors during the time
            period represented by that data point.

          o Minimum  -- the minimum value from a single observation during the
            time period represented by that data point.

          o Maximum -- the maximum value from a single observation during  the
            time period represented by that data point.

          o Average -- the average value from all contributors during the time
            period represented by that data point.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --order-by (string)
          Determines what statistic to use to  rank  the  contributors.  Valid
          values are SUM and MAXIMUM.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       KeyLabels -> (list)
          An array of the strings used as the keys for this rule. The keys are
          the dimensions used to classify contributors. If the  rule  contains
          more  than  one  key, then each unique combination of values for the
          keys is counted as a unique contributor.

          (string)

       AggregationStatistic -> (string)
          Specifies whether this rule aggregates contributor data by COUNT  or
          SUM.

       AggregateValue -> (double)
          The  sum  of  the values from all individual contributors that match
          the rule.

       ApproximateUniqueCount -> (long)
          An approximate count of the unique contributors found by  this  rule
          in this time period.

       Contributors -> (list)
          An  array of the unique contributors found by this rule in this time
          period. If the rule contains multiple keys, each combination of val-
          ues for the keys counts as a unique contributor.

          (structure)
              One  of  the unique contributors found by a Contributor Insights
              rule. If the rule contains multiple keys, then a unique contrib-
              utor  is a unique combination of values from all the keys in the
              rule.

              If the rule contains a single key, then each unique  contributor
              is each unique value for this key.

              For more information, see GetInsightRuleReport .

              Keys -> (list)
                 One  of  the  log entry field keywords that is used to define
                 contributors for this rule.

                 (string)

              ApproximateAggregateValue -> (double)
                 An approximation of the aggregate value that comes from  this
                 contributor.

              Datapoints -> (list)
                 An  array  of  the  data  points  where  this  contributor is
                 present. Only the data points when this contributor  appeared
                 are included in the array.

                 (structure)
                     One data point related to one contributor.

                     For   more   information,  see  GetInsightRuleReport  and
                     InsightRuleContributor .

                     Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                        The timestamp of the data point.

                     ApproximateValue -> (double)

                 The  maximum  value  provided  by one contributor during this
                 timestamp. Each timestamp is  evaluated  separately,  so  the
                 identity  of  the max contributor could be different for each
                 timestamp.
