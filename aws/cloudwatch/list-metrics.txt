LIST-METRICS()                                                  LIST-METRICS()



NAME
       list-metrics -

DESCRIPTION
       List  the  specified  metrics.  You  can  use the returned metrics with
       GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics to obtain statistical data.

       Up to 500 results are returned for any one call. To retrieve additional
       results, use the returned token with subsequent calls.

       After you create a metric, allow up to 15 minutes before the metric ap-
       pears. You  can  see  statistics  about  the  metric  sooner  by  using
       GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics .
          ListMetrics  doesn't  return information about metrics if those met-
          rics haven't reported data in the past two weeks. To retrieve  those
          metrics, use GetMetricData or GetMetricStatistics .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-metrics is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Metrics

SYNOPSIS
            list-metrics
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--metric-name <value>]
          [--dimensions <value>]
          [--recently-active <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --namespace (string)
          The metric namespace to filter  against.  Only  the  namespace  that
          matches exactly will be returned.

       --metric-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  metric  to filter against. Only the metrics with
          names that match exactly will be returned.

       --dimensions (list)
          The dimensions to filter against. Only the dimensions that match ex-
          actly will be returned.

          (structure)
              Represents filters for a dimension.

              Name -> (string)
                 The dimension name to be matched.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the dimension to be matched.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --recently-active (string)
          To filter the results to show only metrics that have had data points
          published in the past three hours, specify  this  parameter  with  a
          value of PT3H . This is the only valid value for this parameter.

          The  results that are returned are an approximation of the value you
          specify. There is a low probability that the  returned  results  in-
          clude  metrics  with  last published data as much as 40 minutes more
          than the specified time interval.

          Possible values:

          o PT3H

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Metrics -> (list)
          The metrics that match your request.

          (structure)
              Represents a specific metric.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric. This is a required field.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions for the metric.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions
                     to a metric. Because dimensions are part  of  the  unique
                     identifier  for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add  a unique
                     name/value pair to one of your metrics, you are  creating
                     a new variation of that metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name  of the dimension. Dimension names must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  marks  the start of the next batch of returned re-
          sults.



                                                                LIST-METRICS()
