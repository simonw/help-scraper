DESCRIBE-ALARMS()                                            DESCRIBE-ALARMS()



NAME
       describe-alarms -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the specified alarms. You can filter the results by specify-
       ing a prefix for the alarm name, the alarm state, or a prefix  for  any
       action.

       To  use  this  operation and return information about composite alarms,
       you must be signed on  with  the  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms  permission
       that  is  scoped  to  *  . You can't return information about composite
       alarms if your  cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms  permission  has  a  narrower
       scope.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-alarms is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: MetricAlarms, CompositeAlarms

OPTIONS
       --alarm-names (list)
          The names of the alarms to retrieve information about.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --alarm-name-prefix (string)
          An alarm name prefix. If you specify this parameter, you receive in-
          formation about all alarms that have names that start with this pre-
          fix.

          If this parameter is specified, you cannot specify AlarmNames .

       --alarm-types (list)
          Use this parameter to specify whether you want the operation to  re-
          turn  metric alarms or composite alarms. If you omit this parameter,
          only metric alarms are returned, even if composite alarms  exist  in
          the account.

          For  example,  if  you omit this parameter or specify MetricAlarms ,
          the operation returns only a list of metric alarms. It does not  re-
          turn any composite alarms, even if composite alarms exist in the ac-
          count.

          If you specify CompositeAlarms , the operation returns only  a  list
          of composite alarms, and does not return any metric alarms.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CompositeAlarm
            MetricAlarm

       --children-of-alarm-name (string)
          If you use this parameter and specify the name of a composite alarm,
          the operation returns information about the "children" alarms of the
          alarm  you specify. These are the metric alarms and composite alarms
          referenced in the AlarmRule field of the composite  alarm  that  you
          specify  in  ChildrenOfAlarmName  .  Information about the composite
          alarm that you name in ChildrenOfAlarmName is not returned.

          If you specify ChildrenOfAlarmName , you cannot  specify  any  other
          parameters  in  the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken . If
          you do so, you receive a validation error.

          NOTE:
              Only the  Alarm  Name  ,  ARN  ,  StateValue  (OK/ALARM/INSUFFI-
              CIENT_DATA),  and StateUpdatedTimestamp information are returned
              by this operation when you use this parameter. To  get  complete
              information  about  these alarms, perform another DescribeAlarms
              operation and specify the parent alarm names in  the  AlarmNames
              parameter.

       --parents-of-alarm-name (string)
          If  you  use this parameter and specify the name of a metric or com-
          posite alarm, the operation returns information about  the  "parent"
          alarms of the alarm you specify. These are the composite alarms that
          have AlarmRule parameters that reference the  alarm  named  in  Par-
          entsOfAlarmName  .  Information  about the alarm that you specify in
          ParentsOfAlarmName is not returned.

          If you specify ParentsOfAlarmName , you cannot specify any other pa-
          rameters in the request except for MaxRecords and NextToken . If you
          do so, you receive a validation error.

          NOTE:
              Only the Alarm Name and ARN are returned by this operation  when
              you  use this parameter. To get complete information about these
              alarms, perform another DescribeAlarms operation and specify the
              parent alarm names in the AlarmNames parameter.

       --state-value (string)
          Specify this parameter to receive information only about alarms that
          are currently in the state that you specify.

          Possible values:

          o OK

          o ALARM

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA

       --action-prefix (string)
          Use this parameter to filter the results of the  operation  to  only
          those alarms that use a certain alarm action. For example, you could
          specify the ARN of an SNS topic to find all alarms that send notifi-
          cations to that topic.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              ActionsSuppressedBy -> (string)
                 When the value is ALARM , it means that the actions are  sup-
                 pressed  because  the  suppressor  alarm is in ALARM When the
                 value is WaitPeriod , it means  that  the  actions  are  sup-
                 pressed  because  the composite alarm is waiting for the sup-
                 pressor alarm to go into into the ALARM  state.  The  maximum
                 waiting time is as specified in ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod .
                 After this time, the composite alarm  performs  its  actions.
                 When the value is ExtensionPeriod , it means that the actions
                 are suppressed because the composite alarm is  waiting  after
                 the suppressor alarm went out of the ALARM state. The maximum
                 waiting time is as specified in ActionsSuppressorExtensionPe-
                 riod  . After this time, the composite alarm performs its ac-
                 tions.

                 Captures the reason for action suppression.

              ActionsSuppressor -> (string)
                 Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in  the
                 ALARM state. ActionsSuppressor can be an AlarmName or an Ama-
                 zon Resource Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.

              ActionsSuppressorWaitPeriod -> (integer)
                 The maximum time in seconds that the  composite  alarm  waits
                 for  the  suppressor  alarm to go into the ALARM state. After
                 this time, the composite alarm performs its actions.

                 WARNING:
                     WaitPeriod is required  only  when  ActionsSuppressor  is
                     specified.

              ActionsSuppressorExtensionPeriod -> (integer)
                 The  maximum  time  in seconds that the composite alarm waits
                 after suppressor alarm goes out of  the  ALARM  state.  After
                 this time, the composite alarm performs its actions.

                 WARNING:
                     ExtensionPeriod  is  required only when ActionsSuppressor
                     is specified.

                 An explanation for the alarm state, in text format.

              StateReasonData -> (string)
                 An explanation for the alarm state, in JSON format.

              StateUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time stamp of the last update to the value of either the
                 StateValue or EvaluationState parameters.

              MetricName -> (string)
                 The name of the metric associated with the alarm, if this  is
                 an alarm based on a single metric.

              Namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the metric associated with the alarm.

              Statistic -> (string)
                 The statistic for the metric associated with the alarm, other
                 than percentile. For  percentile  statistics,  use  Extended-
                 Statistic .

              ExtendedStatistic -> (string)
                 The  percentile  statistic for the metric associated with the
                 alarm. Specify a value between p0.0 and p100.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the
                     unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
                     name/value  pair to one of your metrics, you are creating
                     a new variation of that metric. For example, many  Amazon
                     EC2  metrics  publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and
                     the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension. Dimension names  must  con-
                        tain  only ASCII characters, must include at least one
                        non-whitespace character,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                        colon (: ). ASCII control characters are not supported
                        as part of dimension names.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain  only  ASCII characters and must include at least
                        one non-whitespace character. ASCII control characters
                        are not supported as part of dimension values.

              Period -> (integer)
                 The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  periods  over  which data is compared to the
                 specified threshold.

              DatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                 The number of data points that must be breaching  to  trigger
                 the alarm.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The  arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified
                 statistic and threshold. The  specified  statistic  value  is
                 used as the first operand.

              TreatMissingData -> (string)
                 Sets  how  this  alarm  is to handle missing data points. The
                 valid values are breaching ,  notBreaching  ,  ignore  ,  and
                 missing  .  For  more information, see Configuring how Cloud-
                 Watch alarms treat missing data .

                 If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior of missing
                 is used.

              EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile -> (string)
                 Used  only  for  alarms based on percentiles. If ignore , the
                 alarm state does not change during periods with too few  data
                 points  to  be statistically significant. If evaluate or this
                 parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and pos-
                 sibly changes state no matter how many data points are avail-
                 able.

              Metrics -> (list)
                 An array of MetricDataQuery  structures,  used  in  an  alarm
                 based  on a metric math expression. Each structure either re-
                 trieves a metric or performs a math expression. One  item  in
                 the  Metrics  array  is  the  math  expression that the alarm
                 watches. This expression by designated by  having  ReturnData
                 set to true.

                 (structure)
                     This  structure is used in both GetMetricData and PutMet-
                     ricAlarm . The supported use of this structure is differ-
                     ent for those two operations.

                     When used in GetMetricData , it indicates the metric data
                     to return, and whether this call  is  just  retrieving  a
                     batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Met-
                     rics Insights query or a math expression. A  single  Get-
                     MetricData  call  can  include  up to 500 MetricDataQuery
                     structures.

                     When used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create an
                     alarm based on a metric math expression. Each MetricData-
                     Query in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve,
                     or  a  math  expression to be performed on retrieved met-
                     rics. A single PutMetricAlarm call can include up  to  20
                     MetricDataQuery  structures  in  the array. The 20 struc-
                     tures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a
                     MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as
                     10 structures that contain the  Expression  parameter  to
                     perform  a  math  expression.  Of those Expression struc-
                     tures, one must have true as the value for  ReturnData  .
                     The  result  of  this  expression  is the value the alarm
                     watches.

                     Any expression used in a  PutMetricAlarm  operation  must
                     return  a  single  time series. For more information, see
                     Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch
                     User Guide .

                     Some  of  the parameters of this structure also have dif-
                     ferent uses whether you are using  this  structure  in  a
                     GetMetricData  operation  or  a PutMetricAlarm operation.
                     These differences are explained in the following  parame-
                     ter list.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A short name used to tie this object to the results in
                        the response. This name must be unique within a single
                        call to GetMetricData . If you are performing math ex-
                        pressions on this set of data,  this  name  represents
                        that data and can serve as a variable in the mathemat-
                        ical expression. The  valid  characters  are  letters,
                        numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a
                        lowercase letter.

                     MetricStat -> (structure)
                        The metric to be returned, along with statistics,  pe-
                        riod,  and  units. Use this parameter only if this ob-
                        ject is retrieving a metric and not performing a  math
                        expression on returned data.

                        Within  one  MetricDataQuery  object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Metric -> (structure)
                            The metric to return, including the  metric  name,
                            namespace, and dimensions.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric.

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  metric.  This is a required
                               field.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               The dimensions for the metric.

                               (structure)
                                   A dimension is a name/value  pair  that  is
                                   part  of  the identity of a metric. Because
                                   dimensions are part of the  unique  identi-
                                   fier  for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add a
                                   unique name/value pair to one of your  met-
                                   rics,  you  are creating a new variation of
                                   that metric. For example, many  Amazon  EC2
                                   metrics  publish  InstanceId as a dimension
                                   name, and the actual  instance  ID  as  the
                                   value for that dimension.

                                   You  can  assign  up  to 30 dimensions to a
                                   metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name  of  the  dimension.  Dimension
                                      names  must  contain  only ASCII charac-
                                      ters,  must   include   at   least   one
                                      non-whitespace   character,  and  cannot
                                      start with a colon (: ).  ASCII  control
                                      characters  are not supported as part of
                                      dimension names.

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of  the  dimension.  Dimension
                                      values  must  contain only ASCII charac-
                                      ters  and  must  include  at  least  one
                                      non-whitespace  character. ASCII control
                                      characters are not supported as part  of
                                      dimension values.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  granularity, in seconds, of the returned data
                            points. For metrics with regular resolution, a pe-
                            riod  can  be  as short as one minute (60 seconds)
                            and must be a multiple of 60. For  high-resolution
                            metrics  that  are  collected at intervals of less
                            than one minute, the period can be 1, 5,  10,  30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are those metrics stored by a  PutMetricData  call
                            that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            If  the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the  period  as  follows or no data points in that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start  time  between  15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        Stat -> (string)
                            The statistic to return. It can include any Cloud-
                            Watch statistic or extended statistic.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            When you are using a Put operation,  this  defines
                            what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                            In a Get operation, if you omit Unit then all data
                            that was collected  with  any  unit  is  returned,
                            along with the corresponding units that were spec-
                            ified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If
                            you  specify  a  unit,  the operation returns only
                            data that was collected with that unit  specified.
                            If you specify a unit that does not match the data
                            collected, the results of the operation are  null.
                            CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        This  field  can  contain  either  a  Metrics Insights
                        query, or a metric math expression to be performed  on
                        the  returned data. For more information about Metrics
                        Insights queries, see Metrics  Insights  query  compo-
                        nents and syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        A  math expression can use the Id of the other metrics
                        or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use
                        the Id of other expressions to use the result of those
                        expressions. For more information  about  metric  math
                        expressions,  see  Metric Math Syntax and Functions in
                        the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Label -> (string)
                        A  human-readable label for this metric or expression.
                        This is especially useful if this is an expression, so
                        that you know what the value represents. If the metric
                        or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard  wid-
                        get,  the  label is shown. If Label is omitted, Cloud-
                        Watch generates a default.

                        You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so  that
                        it  is  more  descriptive.  For  more information, see
                        Using Dynamic Labels .

                     ReturnData -> (boolean)
                        When used in GetMetricData  ,  this  option  indicates
                        whether  to  return the timestamps and raw data values
                        of this metric. If you are performing this  call  just
                        to  do  math  expressions and do not also need the raw
                        data returned, you can specify false  .  If  you  omit
                        this, the default of true is used.

                        When used in PutMetricAlarm , specify true for the one
                        expression result to use as the alarm. For  all  other
                        metrics and expressions in the same PutMetricAlarm op-
                        eration, specify ReturnData as False.

                     Period -> (integer)
                        The granularity, in  seconds,  of  the  returned  data
                        points.  For metrics with regular resolution, a period
                        can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be
                        a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are
                        collected at intervals of less than  one  minute,  the
                        period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                        High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by  a
                        PutMetricData operation that includes a StorageResolu-
                        tion of 1 second .

                     AccountId -> (string)
                        The ID of the account where the metrics are located.

                        If you are performing a GetMetricData operation  in  a
                        monitoring  account, use this to specify which account
                        to retrieve this metric from.

                        If you are performing a PutMetricAlarm operation,  use
                        this to specify which account contains the metric that
                        the alarm is watching.

              ThresholdMetricId -> (string)
                 In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is  the
                 ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the thresh-
                 old for the alarm.

              EvaluationState -> (string)
                 If the value of this field is PARTIAL_DATA , the alarm is be-
                 ing evaluated based on only partial data. This happens if the
                 query used for the alarm returns more  than  10,000  metrics.
                 For  more  information, see Create alarms on Metrics Insights
                 queries .

              StateTransitionedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time that the alarm's StateValue  most  recently
                 changed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The  token  that  marks  the start of the next batch of returned re-
          sults.
