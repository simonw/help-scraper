NAME
       describe-alarms-for-metric -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  alarms for the specified metric. To filter the results,
       specify a statistic, period, or unit.

       This operation retrieves only standard alarms that  are  based  on  the
       specified  metric.  It does not return alarms based on math expressions
       that use the specified metric, or composite alarms that use the  speci-
       fied metric.

OPTIONS
       --metric-name (string)
          The name of the metric.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the metric.

       --statistic (string)
          The statistic for the metric, other than percentiles. For percentile
          statistics, use ExtendedStatistics .

          Possible values:

          o SampleCount

          o Average

          o Sum

          o Minimum

          o Maximum

       --extended-statistic (string)
          The percentile statistic for the metric.  Specify  a  value  between
          p0.0 and p100.

       --dimensions (list)
          The dimensions associated with the metric. If the metric has any as-
          sociated dimensions, you must specify them in order for the call  to
          succeed.

          (structure)
              A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of
              a metric. Because dimensions are part of the  unique  identifier
              for  a  metric, whenever you add a unique name/value pair to one
              of your metrics, you are creating a new variation of  that  met-
              ric.  For example, many Amazon EC2 metrics publish InstanceId as
              a dimension name, and the actual instance ID as  the  value  for
              that dimension.

              You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name of the dimension. Dimension names must contain only
                 ASCII characters, must include at  least  one  non-whitespace
                 character, and cannot start with a colon (: ).

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of  the  dimension. Dimension values must contain
                 only  ASCII  characters  and  must  include  at   least   one
                 non-whitespace character.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

            }
            ...
          ]

       --period (integer)
          The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

       --unit (string)
          The unit for the metric.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To display information about alarms associated with a metric

       The  following  example  uses the describe-alarms-for-metric command to
       display information about any alarms associated  with  the  Amazon  EC2
       CPUUtilization metric and the instance with the ID i-0c986c72.:

          aws cloudwatch describe-alarms-for-metric --metric-name CPUUtilization --namespace AWS/EC2 --dimensions Name=InstanceId,Value=i-0c986c72

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 The dimensions for the metric associated with the alarm.

                 (structure)
                     A dimension is a name/value pair  that  is  part  of  the
                     identity  of a metric. Because dimensions are part of the
                     unique identifier for a metric, whenever you add a unique
                     name/value  pair to one of your metrics, you are creating
                     a new variation of that metric. For example, many  Amazon
                     EC2  metrics  publish InstanceId as a dimension name, and
                     the actual instance ID as the value for that dimension.

                     You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The name of the dimension. Dimension names  must  con-
                        tain  only ASCII characters, must include at least one
                        non-whitespace character,  and  cannot  start  with  a
                        colon (: ).

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension. Dimension values must con-
                        tain only ASCII characters and must include  at  least
                        one non-whitespace character.

              Period -> (integer)
                 The period, in seconds, over which the statistic is applied.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of the metric associated with the alarm.

              EvaluationPeriods -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  periods  over  which data is compared to the
                 specified threshold.

              DatapointsToAlarm -> (integer)
                 The number of data points that must be breaching  to  trigger
                 the alarm.

              Threshold -> (double)
                 The value to compare with the specified statistic.

              ComparisonOperator -> (string)
                 The  arithmetic operation to use when comparing the specified
                 statistic and threshold. The  specified  statistic  value  is
                 used as the first operand.

              TreatMissingData -> (string)
                 Sets  how  this  alarm  is to handle missing data points. The
                 valid values are breaching ,  notBreaching  ,  ignore  ,  and
                 missing  .  For  more information, see Configuring how Cloud-
                 Watch alarms treat missing data .

                 If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior of missing
                 is used.

              EvaluateLowSampleCountPercentile -> (string)
                 Used  only  for  alarms based on percentiles. If ignore , the
                 alarm state does not change during periods with too few  data
                 points  to  be statistically significant. If evaluate or this
                 parameter is not used, the alarm is always evaluated and pos-
                 sibly changes state no matter how many data points are avail-
                 able.

              Metrics -> (list)
                 An array of MetricDataQuery  structures,  used  in  an  alarm
                 based  on a metric math expression. Each structure either re-
                 trieves a metric or performs a math expression. One  item  in
                 the  Metrics  array  is  the  math  expression that the alarm
                 watches. This expression by designated by  having  ReturnData
                 set to true.

                 (structure)
                     This  structure is used in both GetMetricData and PutMet-
                     ricAlarm . The supported use of this structure is differ-
                     ent for those two operations.

                     When used in GetMetricData , it indicates the metric data
                     to return, and whether this call  is  just  retrieving  a
                     batch set of data for one metric, or is performing a Met-
                     rics Insights query or a math expression. A  single  Get-
                     MetricData  call  can  include  up to 500 MetricDataQuery
                     structures.

                     When used in PutMetricAlarm , it enables you to create an
                     alarm based on a metric math expression. Each MetricData-
                     Query in the array specifies either a metric to retrieve,
                     or  a  math  expression to be performed on retrieved met-
                     rics. A single PutMetricAlarm call can include up  to  20
                     MetricDataQuery  structures  in  the array. The 20 struc-
                     tures can include as many as 10 structures that contain a
                     MetricStat parameter to retrieve a metric, and as many as
                     10 structures that contain the  Expression  parameter  to
                     perform  a  math  expression.  Of those Expression struc-
                     tures, one must have True as the value for  ReturnData  .
                     The  result  of  this  expression  is the value the alarm
                     watches.

                     Any expression used in a  PutMetricAlarm  operation  must
                     return  a  single  time series. For more information, see
                     Metric Math Syntax and Functions in the Amazon CloudWatch
                     User Guide .

                     Some  of  the parameters of this structure also have dif-
                     ferent uses whether you are using  this  structure  in  a
                     GetMetricData  operation  or  a PutMetricAlarm operation.
                     These differences are explained in the following  parame-
                     ter list.

                     Id -> (string)
                        A short name used to tie this object to the results in
                        the response. This name must be unique within a single
                        call to GetMetricData . If you are performing math ex-
                        pressions on this set of data,  this  name  represents
                        that data and can serve as a variable in the mathemat-
                        ical expression. The  valid  characters  are  letters,
                        numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a
                        lowercase letter.

                     MetricStat -> (structure)
                        The metric to be returned, along with statistics,  pe-
                        riod,  and  units. Use this parameter only if this ob-
                        ject is retrieving a metric and not performing a  math
                        expression on returned data.

                        Within  one  MetricDataQuery  object, you must specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                        Metric -> (structure)
                            The metric to return, including the  metric  name,
                            namespace, and dimensions.

                            Namespace -> (string)
                               The namespace of the metric.

                            MetricName -> (string)
                               The  name  of  the  metric.  This is a required
                               field.

                            Dimensions -> (list)
                               The dimensions for the metric.

                               (structure)
                                   A dimension is a name/value  pair  that  is
                                   part  of  the identity of a metric. Because
                                   dimensions are part of the  unique  identi-
                                   fier  for  a  metric,  whenever  you  add a
                                   unique name/value pair to one of your  met-
                                   rics,  you  are creating a new variation of
                                   that metric. For example, many  Amazon  EC2
                                   metrics  publish  InstanceId as a dimension
                                   name, and the actual  instance  ID  as  the
                                   value for that dimension.

                                   You  can  assign  up  to 30 dimensions to a
                                   metric.

                                   Name -> (string)
                                      The name  of  the  dimension.  Dimension
                                      names  must  contain  only ASCII charac-
                                      ters,  must   include   at   least   one
                                      non-whitespace   character,  and  cannot
                                      start with a colon (: ).

                                   Value -> (string)
                                      The value of  the  dimension.  Dimension
                                      values  must  contain only ASCII charac-
                                      ters  and  must  include  at  least  one
                                      non-whitespace character.

                        Period -> (integer)
                            The  granularity, in seconds, of the returned data
                            points. For metrics with regular resolution, a pe-
                            riod  can  be  as short as one minute (60 seconds)
                            and must be a multiple of 60. For  high-resolution
                            metrics  that  are  collected at intervals of less
                            than one minute, the period can be 1, 5,  10,  30,
                            60, or any multiple of 60. High-resolution metrics
                            are those metrics stored by a  PutMetricData  call
                            that includes a StorageResolution of 1 second.

                            If  the StartTime parameter specifies a time stamp
                            that is greater than 3 hours ago, you must specify
                            the  period  as  follows or no data points in that
                            time range is returned:

                            o Start time between 3 hours and 15 days ago - Use
                              a multiple of 60 seconds (1 minute).

                            o Start  time  between  15 and 63 days ago - Use a
                              multiple of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

                            o Start time greater than 63 days ago - Use a mul-
                              tiple of 3600 seconds (1 hour).

                        Stat -> (string)
                            The statistic to return. It can include any Cloud-
                            Watch statistic or extended statistic.

                        Unit -> (string)
                            When you are using a Put operation,  this  defines
                            what unit you want to use when storing the metric.

                            In a Get operation, if you omit Unit then all data
                            that was collected  with  any  unit  is  returned,
                            along with the corresponding units that were spec-
                            ified when the data was reported to CloudWatch. If
                            you  specify  a  unit,  the operation returns only
                            data that was collected with that unit  specified.
                            If you specify a unit that does not match the data
                            collected, the results of the operation are  null.
                            CloudWatch does not perform unit conversions.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        This  field  can  contain  either  a  Metrics Insights
                        query, or a metric math expression to be performed  on
                        the  returned data. For more information about Metrics
                        Insights queries, see Metrics  Insights  query  compo-
                        nents and syntax in the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        A  math expression can use the Id of the other metrics
                        or queries to refer to those metrics, and can also use
                        the Id of other expressions to use the result of those
                        expressions. For more information  about  metric  math
                        expressions,  see  Metric Math Syntax and Functions in
                        the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide .

                        Within each MetricDataQuery object, you  must  specify
                        either Expression or MetricStat but not both.

                     Label -> (string)
                        A  human-readable label for this metric or expression.
                        This is especially useful if this is an expression, so
                        that you know what the value represents. If the metric
                        or expression is shown in a CloudWatch dashboard  wid-
                        get,  the  label is shown. If Label is omitted, Cloud-
                        Watch generates a default.

                        You can put dynamic expressions into a label, so  that
                        it  is  more  descriptive.  For  more information, see
                        Using Dynamic Labels .

                     ReturnData -> (boolean)
                        When used in GetMetricData  ,  this  option  indicates
                        whether  to  return the timestamps and raw data values
                        of this metric. If you are performing this  call  just
                        to  do  math  expressions and do not also need the raw
                        data returned, you can specify False  .  If  you  omit
                        this, the default of True is used.

                        When used in PutMetricAlarm , specify True for the one
                        expression result to use as the alarm. For  all  other
                        metrics and expressions in the same PutMetricAlarm op-
                        eration, specify ReturnData as False.

                     Period -> (integer)
                        The granularity, in  seconds,  of  the  returned  data
                        points.  For metrics with regular resolution, a period
                        can be as short as one minute (60 seconds) and must be
                        a multiple of 60. For high-resolution metrics that are
                        collected at intervals of less than  one  minute,  the
                        period can be 1, 5, 10, 30, 60, or any multiple of 60.
                        High-resolution metrics are those metrics stored by  a
                        PutMetricData operation that includes a StorageResolu-
                        tion of 1 second .

                     AccountId -> (string)
                        The ID of the account where the metrics  are  located,
                        if this is a cross-account alarm.

                        Use  this field only for PutMetricAlarm operations. It
                        is not used in GetMetricData operations.

              ThresholdMetricId -> (string)
                 In an alarm based on an anomaly detection model, this is  the
                 ID of the ANOMALY_DETECTION_BAND function used as the thresh-
                 old for the alarm.
