SYNOPSIS
            describe-insight-rules
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Include this value, if it was returned by the previous operation, to
          get the next set of rules.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results to return in one operation. If you
          omit this parameter, the default of 500 is used.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          If  this parameter is present, it is a token that marks the start of
          the next batch of returned results.

       InsightRules -> (list)
          The rules returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              This structure contains the definition  for  a  Contributor  In-
              sights  rule.  For  more  information about this rule, see`Using
              Constributor  Insights  to  analyze  high-cardinality  data   <-
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitor-
              ing/ContributorInsights.html>`__ in the Amazon  CloudWatch  User
              Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the rule.

              State -> (string)
                 Indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled.

              Schema -> (string)
                 For  rules  that  you create, this is always {"Name": "Cloud-
                 WatchLogRule", "Version": 1} . For  managed  rules,  this  is
                 {"Name": "ServiceLogRule", "Version": 1}

              Definition -> (string)
                 The  definition of the rule, as a JSON object. The definition
                 contains the keywords used to define contributors, the  value
                 to  aggregate  on  if  this  rule  returns a sum instead of a
                 count, and the filters. For details on the valid syntax,  see
                 Contributor Insights Rule Syntax .
