PUT-COMPOSITE-ALARM()                                    PUT-COMPOSITE-ALARM()



NAME
       put-composite-alarm -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  or  updates  a  composite  alarm . When you create a composite
       alarm, you specify a rule expression for the alarm that takes into  ac-
       count  the alarm states of other alarms that you have created. The com-
       posite alarm goes into ALARM state only if all conditions of  the  rule
       are met.

       The alarms specified in a composite alarm's rule expression can include
       metric alarms and other composite alarms. The rule expression of a com-
       posite  alarm  can include as many as 100 underlying alarms. Any single
       alarm can be included in the rule expressions of as many as 150 compos-
       ite alarms.

       Using  composite alarms can reduce alarm noise. You can create multiple
       metric alarms, and also create a composite alarm and set up alerts only
       for  the  composite  alarm.  For  example, you could create a composite
       alarm that goes into ALARM state only when more than one of the  under-
       lying metric alarms are in ALARM state.

       Currently, the only alarm actions that can be taken by composite alarms
       are notifying SNS topics.

       NOTE:
          It is possible to create a loop or cycle of composite alarms,  where
          composite  alarm A depends on composite alarm B, and composite alarm
          B also depends on composite alarm A. In  this  scenario,  you  can't
          delete  any  composite alarm that is part of the cycle because there
          is always still a composite alarm that depends on  that  alarm  that
          you want to delete.

          To get out of such a situation, you must break the cycle by changing
          the rule of one of the composite alarms in the cycle to remove a de-
          pendency  that  creates  the  cycle.  The simplest change to make to
          break a cycle is to change the AlarmRule of one  of  the  alarms  to
          False .

          Additionally, the evaluation of composite alarms stops if CloudWatch
          detects a cycle in the evaluation path.

       When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm  state  is  immediately
       set to INSUFFICIENT_DATA . The alarm is then evaluated and its state is
       set appropriately. Any actions associated with the new state  are  then
       executed.  For  a  composite alarm, this initial time after creation is
       the only time that the alarm can be in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

       When you update an existing alarm, its state is left unchanged, but the
       update completely overwrites the previous configuration of the alarm.

       To  use  this operation, you must be signed on with the cloudwatch:Put-
       CompositeAlarm permission that is scoped to * . You can't create a com-
       posite  alarms  if  your  cloudwatch:PutCompositeAlarm permission has a
       narrower scope.

       If you are an IAM user, you must  have  iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole  to
       create a composite alarm that has Systems Manager OpsItem actions.

OPTIONS
       --actions-enabled | --no-actions-enabled (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  actions should be executed during any changes to
          the alarm state of the composite alarm. The default is TRUE .

       --alarm-actions (list)
          The actions to execute when this  alarm  transitions  to  the  ALARM
          state  from  any  other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon
          Resource Name (ARN).

          Valid Values:
          ``
          arn:aws:sns:region :account-id :sns-topic-name `` |
          ``
          arn:aws:ssm:region :account-id :opsitem:severity ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 115)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 115)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --alarm-description (string)
          The description for the composite alarm.

       --alarm-name (string)
          The name for the composite alarm. This name must  be  unique  within
          the Region.

       --alarm-rule (string)
          An  expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated
          to determine this composite alarm's state. For each alarm  that  you
          reference,  you  designate  a  function  that specifies whether that
          alarm needs to be in ALARM state,  OK  state,  or  INSUFFICIENT_DATA
          state.  You  can use operators (AND, OR and NOT) to combine multiple
          functions in a single expression. You can use parenthesis  to  logi-
          cally group the functions in your expression.

          You can use either alarm names or ARNs to reference the other alarms
          that are to be evaluated.

          Functions can include the following:

          o ALARM("*alarm-name* or *alarm-ARN* ") is TRUE if the  named  alarm
            is in ALARM state.

          o OK("*alarm-name*  or  *alarm-ARN* ") is TRUE if the named alarm is
            in OK state.

          o INSUFFICIENT_DATA("*alarm-name* or *alarm-ARN* ") is TRUE  if  the
            named alarm is in INSUFFICIENT_DATA state.

          o TRUE always evaluates to TRUE.

          o FALSE always evaluates to FALSE.

          TRUE and FALSE are useful for testing a complex AlarmRule structure,
          and for testing your alarm actions.

          Alarm names specified in  AlarmRule  can  be  surrounded  with  dou-
          ble-quotes ("), but do not have to be.

          The following are some examples of AlarmRule :

          o ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh)  AND ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh) speci-
            fies that the composite alarm goes into ALARM state only  if  both
            CPUUtilizationTooHigh  and  DiskReadOpsTooHigh alarms are in ALARM
            state.

          o ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh) AND  NOT  ALARM(DeploymentInProgress)
            specifies  that  the  alarm goes to ALARM state if CPUUtilization-
            TooHigh is in ALARM state and DeploymentInProgress is not in ALARM
            state.  This example reduces alarm noise during a known deployment
            window.

          o (ALARM(CPUUtilizationTooHigh)  OR  ALARM(DiskReadOpsTooHigh))  AND
            OK(NetworkOutTooHigh)  goes  into  ALARM  state if CPUUtilization-
            TooHigh OR DiskReadOpsTooHigh is in ALARM state, and  if  Network-
            OutTooHigh  is in OK state. This provides another example of using
            a composite alarm to prevent noise. This rule ensures that you are
            not  notified  with an alarm action on high CPU or disk usage if a
            known network problem is also occurring.

          The AlarmRule can specify as many  as  100  "children"  alarms.  The
          AlarmRule  expression can have as many as 500 elements. Elements are
          child alarms, TRUE or FALSE statements, and parentheses.

       --insufficient-data-actions (list)
          The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to  the  INSUFFI-
          CIENT_DATA  state  from any other state. Each action is specified as
          an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

          Valid Values:
          ``
          arn:aws:sns:region :account-id :sns-topic-name ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 209)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --ok-actions (list)
          The actions to execute when this alarm transitions to  an  OK  state
          from any other state. Each action is specified as an Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN).

          Valid Values:
          ``
          arn:aws:sns:region :account-id :sns-topic-name ``

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 234)
                 Inline literal start-string without end-string.

                 (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A list of key-value pairs to associate with the composite alarm. You
          can associate as many as 50 tags with an alarm.

          Tags  can  help  you organize and categorize your resources. You can
          also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user  permis-
          sion to access or change only resources with certain tag values.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair associated with a CloudWatch resource.

              Key -> (string)
                 A  string that you can use to assign a value. The combination
                 of tag keys and values can help you organize  and  categorize
                 your resources.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value for the specified tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --actions-suppressor (string)
          Actions  will  be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the ALARM
          state. ActionsSuppressor can be an AlarmName or an  Amazon  Resource
          Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.

       --actions-suppressor-wait-period (integer)
          The  maximum  time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the
          suppressor alarm to go into the ALARM state. After  this  time,  the
          composite alarm performs its actions.

          WARNING:
              WaitPeriod is required only when ActionsSuppressor is specified.

       --actions-suppressor-extension-period (integer)
          The  maximum  time  in  seconds that the composite alarm waits after
          suppressor alarm goes out of the ALARM state. After this  time,  the
          composite alarm performs its actions.

          WARNING:
              ExtensionPeriod is required only when ActionsSuppressor is spec-
              ified.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
