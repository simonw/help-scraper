GET-METRIC-WIDGET-IMAGE()                            GET-METRIC-WIDGET-IMAGE()



NAME
       get-metric-widget-image -

DESCRIPTION
       You  can  use the GetMetricWidgetImage API to retrieve a snapshot graph
       of one or more Amazon CloudWatch metrics as a  bitmap  image.  You  can
       then  embed  this  image  into your services and products, such as wiki
       pages, reports, and documents. You could  also  retrieve  images  regu-
       larly, such as every minute, and create your own custom live dashboard.

       The  graph  you  retrieve  can include all CloudWatch metric graph fea-
       tures, including metric math and horizontal and vertical annotations.

       There is a limit of 20 transactions per second for this API. Each  Get-
       MetricWidgetImage action has the following limits:

       o As many as 100 metrics in the graph.

       o Up to 100 KB uncompressed payload.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-metric-widget-image
          --metric-widget <value>
          [--output-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --metric-widget (string)
          A  JSON  string  that  defines the bitmap graph to be retrieved. The
          string includes the metrics to include in the graph, statistics, an-
          notations,  title,  axis limits, and so on. You can include only one
          MetricWidget parameter in each GetMetricWidgetImage call.

          For  more  information  about  the  syntax   of   MetricWidget   see
          GetMetricWidgetImage: Metric Widget Structure and Syntax .

          If  any  metric  on  the graph could not load all the requested data
          points, an orange triangle with an exclamation point appears next to
          the graph legend.

       --output-format (string)
          The format of the resulting image. Only PNG images are supported.

          The  default  is  png . If you specify png , the API returns an HTTP
          response with the content-type set to text/xml . The image  data  is
          in a MetricWidgetImage field. For example:
              <GetMetricWidgetImageResponse xmlns=<URLstring>>

              <GetMetricWidgetImageResult>

              <MetricWidgetImage>

              iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAlgAAAGQEAYAAAAip...

              </MetricWidgetImage>

              </GetMetricWidgetImageResult>

              <ResponseMetadata>

              <RequestId>6f0d4192-4d42-11e8-82c1-f539a07e0e3b</RequestId>

              </ResponseMetadata>

              </GetMetricWidgetImageResponse>

          The image/png setting is intended only for custom HTTP requests. For
          most use cases, and all actions using an Amazon  Web  Services  SDK,
          you  should  use  png . If you specify image/png , the HTTP response
          has a content-type set to image/png , and the body of  the  response
          is a PNG image.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MetricWidgetImage -> (blob)
          The image of the graph, in the output format specified.  The  output
          is base64-encoded.
