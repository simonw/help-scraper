REGISTER-INSTANCE()                                        REGISTER-INSTANCE()



NAME
       register-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  instances  that  were created outside of AWS OpsWorks Stacks
       with a specified stack.

       NOTE:
          We do not recommend using this action  to  register  instances.  The
          complete  registration  operation includes two tasks: installing the
          AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent on the instance, and registering  the  in-
          stance  with  the  stack.  RegisterInstance  handles only the second
          step. You should instead use the AWS  CLI  register  command,  which
          performs  the  entire  registration operation. For more information,
          see Registering an Instance with an AWS OpsWorks Stacks Stack .

       Registered instances have the same requirements as instances  that  are
       created  by  using the  CreateInstance API. For example, registered in-
       stances must be running a supported Linux-based operating  system,  and
       they  must  have  a supported instance type. For more information about
       requirements for instances that you want to register, see Preparing the
       Instance .
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Manage permissions level for the stack or an  attached  policy  that
          explicitly  grants permissions. For more information on user permis-
          sions, see Managing User Permissions .

SYNOPSIS
            register-instance
          --stack-id <value>
          [--hostname <value>]
          [--public-ip <value>]
          [--private-ip <value>]
          [--rsa-public-key <value>]
          [--rsa-public-key-fingerprint <value>]
          [--instance-identity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The ID of the stack that the instance is to be registered with.

       --hostname (string)
          The instance's hostname.

       --public-ip (string)
          The instance's public IP address.

       --private-ip (string)
          The instance's private IP address.

       --rsa-public-key (string)
          The instances public RSA key. This key is used to encrypt communica-
          tion between the instance and the service.

       --rsa-public-key-fingerprint (string)
          The instances public RSA key fingerprint.

       --instance-identity (structure)
          An InstanceIdentity object that contains the instance's identity.

          Document -> (string)
              A JSON document that contains the metadata.

          Signature -> (string)
              A  signature  that can be used to verify the document's accuracy
              and authenticity.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Document=string,Signature=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Document": "string",
            "Signature": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstanceId -> (string)
          The registered instance's AWS OpsWorks Stacks ID.
