OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The stack name.

       --vpc-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  VPC that the stack is to be launched into. The VPC
          must be in the stack's region. All instances are launched into  this
          VPC. You cannot change the ID later.

          o If  your account supports EC2-Classic, the default value is no VPC
            .

          o If your account does not support EC2-Classic, the default value is
            the default VPC for the specified region.

          If  the  VPC  ID corresponds to a default VPC and you have specified
          either the DefaultAvailabilityZone or the DefaultSubnetId  parameter
          only,  AWS  OpsWorks Stacks infers the value of the other parameter.
          If you specify neither parameter, AWS OpsWorks Stacks sets these pa-
          rameters  to the first valid Availability Zone for the specified re-
          gion and the corresponding default VPC subnet ID, respectively.

          If you specify a nondefault VPC ID, note the following:

          o It must belong to a VPC in your account that is in  the  specified
            region.

          o You must specify a value for DefaultSubnetId .

          For  more  information  about  how to use AWS OpsWorks Stacks with a
          VPC, see Running a Stack in a VPC . For more information  about  de-
          fault VPC and EC2-Classic, see Supported Platforms .

       --attributes (map)
          One  or  more  user-defined key-value pairs to be added to the stack
          attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

            KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

          Where valid key names are:
            Color

       JSON Syntax:

          {"Color": "string"
            ...}

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The stack's AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role, which al-
          lows  AWS OpsWorks Stacks to work with AWS resources on your behalf.
          You must set this parameter to the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an
          existing  IAM  role.  For more information about IAM ARNs, see Using
          Identifiers .

       --default-instance-profile-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM profile that is the default
          profile  for  all of the stack's EC2 instances. For more information
          about IAM ARNs, see Using Identifiers .

       --default-os (string)
          The stack's default operating system, which is  installed  on  every
          instance  unless  you  specify a different operating system when you
          create the instance. You can specify one of the following.

          o A supported Linux operating system: An Amazon Linux version,  such
            as  Amazon  Linux  2018.03  ,  Amazon Linux 2017.09 , Amazon Linux
            2017.03 , Amazon Linux 2016.09 , Amazon  Linux  2016.03  ,  Amazon
            Linux 2015.09 , or Amazon Linux 2015.03 .

          o A  supported  Ubuntu  operating system, such as Ubuntu 16.04 LTS ,
            Ubuntu 14.04 LTS , or Ubuntu 12.04 LTS .

          o CentOS Linux 7

          o Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

          o A supported Windows operating system, such  as  Microsoft  Windows
            Server  2012  R2  Base , Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL
            Server Express , Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL  Server
            Standard , or Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 with SQL Server Web
            .

          o A custom AMI: Custom . You specify the custom AMI you want to  use
            when  you create instances. For more information, see Using Custom
            AMIs .

          The default option is the current Amazon Linux version. For more in-
          formation about supported operating systems, see AWS OpsWorks Stacks
          Operating Systems .

       --hostname-theme (string)
          The stack's host name theme, with spaces  replaced  by  underscores.
          The  theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances.
          By default, HostnameTheme is set to Layer_Dependent , which  creates
          host  names  by  appending  integers  to the layer's short name. The
          other themes are:

          o Baked_Goods

          o Clouds

          o Europe_Cities

          o Fruits

          o Greek_Deities_and_Titans

          o Legendary_creatures_from_Japan

          o Planets_and_Moons

          o Roman_Deities

          o Scottish_Islands

          o US_Cities

          o Wild_Cats

          To obtain a generated host name, call GetHostNameSuggestion ,  which
          returns a host name based on the current theme.

       --default-availability-zone (string)
          The  stack's  default Availability Zone, which must be in the speci-
          fied region. For more information, see Regions and  Endpoints  .  If
          you also specify a value for DefaultSubnetId , the subnet must be in
          the same zone. For more information, see  the  VpcId  parameter  de-
          scription.

       --default-subnet-id (string)
          The stack's default VPC subnet ID. This parameter is required if you
          specify a value for the VpcId parameter. All instances are  launched
          into  this  subnet  unless you specify otherwise when you create the
          instance. If you also specify a value for DefaultAvailabilityZone  ,
          the  subnet  must be in that zone. For information on default values
          and when this parameter is required, see  the  VpcId  parameter  de-
          scription.

       --custom-json (string)
          A  string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. It can be used to
          override the corresponding  default  stack  configuration  attribute
          values  or to pass data to recipes. The string should be in the fol-
          lowing format:
              "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"

          For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to  Mod-
          ify the Stack Configuration Attributes .

       --configuration-manager (structure)
          The configuration manager. When you create a stack we recommend that
          you use the configuration manager to specify the Chef  version:  12,
          11.10, or 11.4 for Linux stacks, or 12.2 for Windows stacks. The de-
          fault value for Linux stacks is currently 12.

          Name -> (string)
              The name. This parameter must be set to "Chef".

          Version -> (string)
              The Chef version. This parameter must be set to  12,  11.10,  or
              11.4  for  Linux stacks, and to 12.2 for Windows stacks. The de-
              fault value for Linux stacks is 11.4.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Version=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "string",
            "Version": "string"
          }

       --chef-configuration (structure)
          A ChefConfiguration object that specifies whether  to  enable  Berk-
          shelf  and  the Berkshelf version on Chef 11.10 stacks. For more in-
          formation, see Create a New Stack .

          ManageBerkshelf -> (boolean)
              Whether to enable Berkshelf.

          BerkshelfVersion -> (string)
              The Berkshelf version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ManageBerkshelf=boolean,BerkshelfVersion=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ManageBerkshelf": true|false,
            "BerkshelfVersion": "string"
          }

       --use-custom-cookbooks | --no-use-custom-cookbooks (boolean)
          Whether the stack uses custom cookbooks.

       --use-opsworks-security-groups   |    --no-use-opsworks-security-groups
       (boolean)
          Whether  to  associate  the  AWS  OpsWorks  Stacks built-in security
          groups with the stack's layers.

          AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a standard  set  of  built-in  security
          groups,  one for each layer, which are associated with layers by de-
          fault. With UseOpsworksSecurityGroups you can instead  provide  your
          own  custom  security groups. UseOpsworksSecurityGroups has the fol-
          lowing settings:

          o True - AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates the  appropri-
            ate built-in security group with each layer (default setting). You
            can associate additional security groups with a  layer  after  you
            create it, but you cannot delete the built-in security group.

          o False  -  AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate built-in security
            groups with layers.  You  must  create  appropriate  EC2  security
            groups  and  associate  a  security group with each layer that you
            create. However, you can still manually associate a built-in secu-
            rity  group  with  a layer on creation; custom security groups are
            required only for those layers that need custom settings.

          For more information, see Create a New Stack .

       --custom-cookbooks-source (structure)
          Contains the information required to retrieve  an  app  or  cookbook
          from  a  repository.  For  more  information,  see  Adding  Apps  or
          Cookbooks and Recipes .

          Type -> (string)
              The repository type.

          Url -> (string)
              The source URL. The following is an  example  of  an  Amazon  S3
              source                  URL:                  https://s3.amazon-
              aws.com/opsworks-demo-bucket/opsworks_cookbook_demo.tar.gz .

          Username -> (string)
              This parameter depends on the repository type.

              o For Amazon S3 bundles, set Username to the appropriate IAM ac-
                cess key ID.

              o For  HTTP  bundles, Git repositories, and Subversion reposito-
                ries, set Username to the user name.

          Password -> (string)
              When included in a request, the parameter depends on the reposi-
              tory type.

              o For Amazon S3 bundles, set Password to the appropriate IAM se-
                cret access key.

              o For HTTP bundles and Subversion repositories, set Password  to
                the password.

              For  more  information  on how to safely handle IAM credentials,
              see
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html
              .

              In responses, AWS OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** in-
              stead of the actual value.

          SshKey -> (string)
              In requests, the repository's SSH key.

              In responses, AWS OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** in-
              stead of the actual value.

          Revision -> (string)
              The application's version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks  enables  you  to
              easily  deploy  new  versions of an application. One of the sim-
              plest approaches is to have branches or revisions in your repos-
              itory  that represent different versions that can potentially be
              deployed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Url=string,Username=string,Password=string,SshKey=string,Revision=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Type": "git"|"svn"|"archive"|"s3",
            "Url": "string",
            "Username": "string",
            "Password": "string",
            "SshKey": "string",
            "Revision": "string"
          }

       --default-ssh-key-name (string)
          A default Amazon EC2 key pair name. The default value  is  none.  If
          you specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on
          the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH  client  to
          log  in to the instance. For more information, see Using SSH to Com-
          municate with an Instance and Managing SSH Access . You can override
          this  setting  by  specifying  a different key pair, or no key pair,
          when you create an instance .

       --default-root-device-type (string)
          The default root device type. This value is the default for all  in-
          stances in the stack, but you can override it when you create an in-
          stance. The default option is instance-store . For more information,
          see Storage for the Root Device .

          Possible values:

          o ebs

          o instance-store

       --agent-version (string)
          The  default AWS OpsWorks Stacks agent version. You have the follow-
          ing options:

          o Auto-update - Set this parameter to LATEST . AWS  OpsWorks  Stacks
            automatically installs new agent versions on the stack's instances
            as soon as they are available.

          o Fixed version - Set this parameter to your  preferred  agent  ver-
            sion. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack config-
            uration and specify a new version. AWS OpsWorks Stacks then  auto-
            matically installs that version on the stack's instances.

          The  default  setting  is  the  most recent release of the agent. To
          specify an agent version, you must use the complete version  number,
          not  the  abbreviated  number  shown  on  the console. For a list of
          available  agent  version  numbers,  call   DescribeAgentVersions  .
          AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12.2.

          NOTE:
              You  can also specify an agent version when you create or update
              an instance, which overrides the stack's default setting.

       --stack-region (string)
          The stack's AWS region, such as ap-south-1 .  For  more  information
          about Amazon regions, see Regions and Endpoints .

          NOTE:
              In  the  AWS CLI, this API maps to the --stack-region parameter.
              If the --stack-region parameter and the AWS CLI common parameter
              --region  are  set  to the same value, the stack uses a regional
              endpoint. If the --stack-region parameter is not  set,  but  the
              AWS CLI --region parameter is, this also results in a stack with
              a regional endpoint. However, if the --region parameter  is  set
              to us-east-1 , and the --stack-region parameter is set to one of
              the following, then the stack uses a legacy or  classic  region:
              us-west-1,   us-west-2,   sa-east-1,   eu-central-1,  eu-west-1,
              ap-northeast-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2 . In  this  case,
              the  actual API endpoint of the stack is in us-east-1 . Only the
              preceding regions  are  supported  as  classic  regions  in  the
              us-east-1  API endpoint. Because it is a best practice to choose
              the regional endpoint that is closest to where you  manage  AWS,
              we recommend that you use regional endpoints for new stacks. The
              AWS CLI common --region parameter always  specifies  a  regional
              API  endpoint;  it  cannot  be  used  to  specify  a classic AWS
              OpsWorks Stacks region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a stack

       The following create-stack command creates a stack named CLI Stack.

          aws opsworks create-stack --name "CLI Stack" --stack-region "us-east-1" --service-role-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/aws-opsworks-service-role --default-instance-profile-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/aws-opsworks-ec2-role --region us-east-1

       The service-role-arn and  default-instance-profile-arn  parameters  are
       required.  You typically use the ones that AWS OpsWorks creates for you
       when you create your first stack. To  get  the  Amazon  Resource  Names
       (ARNs)  for  your  account,  go to the IAM console, choose Roles in the
       navigation panel, choose the role or profile, and  choose  the  Summary
       tab.

       Output:

          {
            "StackId": "f6673d70-32e6-4425-8999-265dd002fec7"
          }

       More Information

       For  more  information, see Create a New Stack in the AWS OpsWorks User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       StackId -> (string)
          The stack ID, which is an opaque string that you use to identify the
          stack when performing actions such as DescribeStacks .



                                                                CREATE-STACK()
