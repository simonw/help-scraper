DESCRIBE-LAYERS()                                            DESCRIBE-LAYERS()



NAME
       describe-layers -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of one or more layers in a specified stack.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-layers
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--layer-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --layer-ids (list)
          An array of layer IDs that specify the layers to  be  described.  If
          you omit this parameter, DescribeLayers returns a description of ev-
          ery layer in the specified stack.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a stack's layers

       The following describe-layers commmand describes the layers in a speci-
       fied stack:

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-layers --stack-id 38ee91e2-abdc-4208-a107-0b7168b3cc7a

              CloudWatchLogsConfiguration -> (structure)
                 The  Amazon  CloudWatch  Logs  configuration settings for the
                 layer.

                     (structure)
                        Describes the Amazon CloudWatch logs configuration for
                        a  layer.  For  detailed  information about members of
                        this data type, see the CloudWatch Logs  Agent  Refer-
                        ence .

                        LogGroupName -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  destination log group. A log group
                            is created automatically if it doesn't already ex-
                            ist.  Log  group  names  can  be between 1 and 512
                            characters long. Allowed characters  include  a-z,
                            A-Z,  0-9,  '_'  (underscore),  '-'  (hyphen), '/'
                            (forward slash), and '.' (period).

                        DatetimeFormat -> (string)
                            Specifies how the time  stamp  is  extracted  from
                            logs.  For  more  information,  see the CloudWatch
                            Logs Agent Reference .

                        TimeZone -> (string)
                            Specifies the time zone of log event time stamps.

                        File -> (string)
                            Specifies log files  that  you  want  to  push  to
                            CloudWatch Logs.
                               File  can  point to a specific file or multiple
                               files (by using wild card  characters  such  as
                               /var/log/system.log* ). Only the latest file is
                               pushed to CloudWatch Logs, based on file  modi-
                               fication  time.  We recommend that you use wild
                               card characters to specify a series of files of
                               the same type, such as access_log.2014-06-01-01
                               , access_log.2014-06-01-02 , and so on by using
                               a pattern like access_log.* . Don't use a wild-
                               card to match multiple file types, such as  ac-
                               cess_log_80  and  access_log_443  .  To specify
                               multiple, different file types, add another log
                               stream entry to the configuration file, so that
                               each log file type is stored in a different log
                               group.

                            Zipped files are not supported.

                        FileFingerprintLines -> (string)
                            Specifies  the  range  of  lines for identifying a
                            file. The valid values  are  one  number,  or  two
                            dash-delimited  numbers,  such  as '1', '2-5'. The
                            default value is '1', meaning the  first  line  is
                            used  to  calculate  the  fingerprint. Fingerprint
                            lines are not sent to CloudWatch Logs  unless  all

                            start_of_file. This setting is only used if  there
                            is no state persisted for that log stream.

                            up to 10000. The default value is 1000.

                        BatchSize -> (integer)
                            Specifies  the  maximum  size  of  log events in a

                            the sum of all event messages in  UTF-8,  plus  26
                            bytes for each log event.

              DefaultRecipes -> (structure)
                 AWS  OpsWorks  Stacks supports five lifecycle events: setup ,
                 configuration , deploy , undeploy , and shutdown .  For  each
                 layer, AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs a set of standard recipes for
                 each event. You can also provide custom recipes  for  any  or
                 all  layers and events. AWS OpsWorks Stacks runs custom event
                 recipes after the standard recipes. LayerCustomRecipes speci-
                 fies  the  custom recipes for a particular layer to be run in
                 response to each of the five events.

                 To specify a recipe, use the cookbook's directory name in the
                 repository  followed by two colons and the recipe name, which
                 is the recipe's file name without the .rb extension. For  ex-
                 ample:  phpapp2::dbsetup  specifies  the dbsetup.rb recipe in
                 the repository's phpapp2 folder.

                 the instance boots. The default value is true . If this value
                 is  set  to false , you must then update your instances manu-
                 ally by using  CreateDeployment to run  the  update_dependen-
                 cies  stack command or manually running yum (Amazon Linux) or
                 apt-get (Ubuntu) on the instances.

                 NOTE:
                     We strongly recommend using the default value of  true  ,
