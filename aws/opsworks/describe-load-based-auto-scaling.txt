NAME
       describe-load-based-auto-scaling -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes load-based auto scaling configurations for specified layers.

       NOTE:
              You must specify at least one of the parameters.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-load-based-auto-scaling
          --layer-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --layer-ids (list)
          An array of layer IDs.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a layer's load-based scaling configuration

       The following example describes a specified layer's load-based  scaling
       configuration.   The layer is identified by its layer ID, which you can
       find on the layer's details page or by running describe-layers.

          aws opsworks describe-load-based-auto-scaling --region us-east-1 --layer-ids 6bec29c9-c866-41a0-aba5-fa3e374ce2a1

       Output: The example layer has a single load-based instance.

          {
            "LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations": [
              {
                "DownScaling": {
                  "IgnoreMetricsTime": 10,
                  "ThresholdsWaitTime": 10,
                  "InstanceCount": 1,
                  "CpuThreshold": 30.0
                },
                "Enable": true,
                "UpScaling": {
                  "IgnoreMetricsTime": 5,
                  "ThresholdsWaitTime": 5,
                  "InstanceCount": 1,
                  "CpuThreshold": 80.0
                },
                "LayerId": "6bec29c9-c866-41a0-aba5-fa3e374ce2a1"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       LoadBasedAutoScalingConfigurations -> (list)
          An  array of LoadBasedAutoScalingConfiguration objects that describe
          each layer's configuration.

          (structure)
              Describes a layer's load-based auto scaling configuration.

              LayerId -> (string)
                 The layer ID.

              Enable -> (boolean)
                 Whether load-based auto scaling is enabled for the layer.

              UpScaling -> (structure)
                 An AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the  upscaling
                 configuration, which defines how and when AWS OpsWorks Stacks
                 increases the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of instances to add or remove  when  the  load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed
                     a threshold before more instances are added or removed.

                 IgnoreMetricsTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time (in minutes) after a scaling event oc-
                     curs  that  AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and
                     suppress additional  scaling  events.  For  example,  AWS
                     OpsWorks Stacks adds new instances following an upscaling
                     event but the instances won't start reducing the load un-
                     til  they  have  been  booted and configured. There is no
                     point in raising additional scaling  events  during  that
                     operation, which typically takes several minutes. Ignore-
                     MetricsTime allows you to direct AWS OpsWorks  Stacks  to
                     suppress  scaling  events  long enough to get the new in-
                     stances online.

                 CpuThreshold -> (double)
                     The CPU utilization threshold, as a percent of the avail-
                     able CPU. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 MemoryThreshold -> (double)
                     The  memory  utilization  threshold,  as a percent of the
                     available memory. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                 LoadThreshold -> (double)
                     The load threshold. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

                     (computing) .

                 Alarms -> (list)
                     Custom Cloudwatch auto scaling  alarms,  to  be  used  as
                     thresholds.  This  parameter  takes  a list of up to five
                     alarm names, which are case sensitive and must be in  the
                     same region as the stack.

                     NOTE:
                        To  use  custom  alarms,  you must update your service
                        role to allow cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms . You can  ei-
                        ther  have AWS OpsWorks Stacks update the role for you
                        when you first use this feature or you  can  edit  the
                        role  manually. For more information, see Allowing AWS
                        OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your Behalf .

                     (string)

              DownScaling -> (structure)
                 An AutoScalingThresholds object that describes the  downscal-
                 ing  configuration,  which  defines how and when AWS OpsWorks
                 Stacks reduces the number of instances.

                 InstanceCount -> (integer)
                     The number of instances to add or remove  when  the  load
                     exceeds a threshold.

                 ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
                     The amount of time, in minutes, that the load must exceed
                     a threshold before more instances are added or removed.
