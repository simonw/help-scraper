OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --app-id (string)
          The  app ID. This parameter is required for app deployments, but not
          for other deployment commands.

       --instance-ids (list)
          The instance IDs for the deployment targets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --layer-ids (list)
          The layer IDs for the deployment targets.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --command (structure)
          A DeploymentCommand object that specifies the deployment command and
          any associated arguments.

          Name -> (string)
              Specifies the operation. You can specify only one command.

              For stacks, the following commands are available:

              o execute_recipes  : Execute one or more recipes. To specify the
                recipes, set an Args parameter named recipes to  the  list  of
                recipes   to   be   executed.  For  example,  to  execute  ph-
                papp::appsetup , set Args to  {"recipes":["phpapp::appsetup"]}
                .

              o install_dependencies : Install the stack's dependencies.

              o update_custom_cookbooks : Update the stack's custom cookbooks.

              o update_dependencies : Update the stack's dependencies.

              NOTE:
                 The update_dependencies and install_dependencies commands are
                 supported only for Linux instances. You can run the  commands
                 successfully on Windows instances, but they do nothing.

              For apps, the following commands are available:

              o deploy  :  Deploy  an app. Ruby on Rails apps have an optional
                Args  parameter  named   migrate   .   Set   Args   to   {"mi-
                grate":["true"]}  to migrate the database. The default setting
                is {"migrate":["false"]}.

              o rollback Roll the app back to the previous version.  When  you
                update  an  app,  AWS OpsWorks Stacks stores the previous ver-
                sion, up to a maximum of five versions. You can use this  com-
                mand to roll an app back as many as four versions.

              o start : Start the app's web or application server.

              o stop : Stop the app's web or application server.

              o restart : Restart the app's web or application server.

              o undeploy : Undeploy the app.

          Args -> (map)
              The  arguments  of those commands that take arguments. It should
              be set to a JSON object with the following format:
                 {"arg_name1"  :  ["value1",  "value2",  ...],  "arg_name2"  :
                 ["value1", "value2", ...], ...}

              The update_dependencies command takes two arguments:

              o upgrade_os_to - Specifies the desired Amazon Linux version for
                instances whose OS you want to upgrade, such as  Amazon  Linux
                2016.09 . You must also set the allow_reboot argument to true.

              o allow_reboot  - Specifies whether to allow AWS OpsWorks Stacks
                to reboot the instances if necessary, after installing the up-
                dates.  This argument can be set to either true or false . The
                default value is false .

              For example, to upgrade an instance to Amazon Linux 2016.09, set
              Args to the following.
                 {   "upgrade_os_to":["Amazon   Linux   2016.09"],  "allow_re-
                 boot":["true"] }

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Args={KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Name": "install_dependencies"|"update_dependencies"|"update_custom_cookbooks"|"execute_recipes"|"configure"|"setup"|"deploy"|"rollback"|"start"|"stop"|"restart"|"undeploy",
            "Args": {"string": ["string", ...]
              ...}
          }

       --comment (string)
          A user-defined comment.

       --custom-json (string)
          A string that contains user-defined, custom JSON. You can  use  this
          parameter to override some corresponding default stack configuration
          JSON values. The string should be in the following format:
              "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"

          For more information about custom JSON, see Use Custom JSON to  Mod-
          ify  the  Stack  Configuration  Attributes and Overriding Attributes
          With Custom JSON .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To deploy apps and run stack commands

       The following examples show how to use the create-deployment command to
       deploy  apps and run stack commands.  Notice that the quote (") charac-
       ters in the JSON object that specifies the command are all preceded  by
       escape characters (\). Without the escape characters, the command might
       return an invalid JSON error.

       The following create-deployment example deploys an app to  a  specified
       stack.

          aws opsworks create-deployment \
              --stack-id cfb7e082-ad1d-4599-8e81-de1c39ab45bf \
              --app-id 307be5c8-d55d-47b5-bd6e-7bd417c6c7eb
              --command "{\"Name\":\"deploy\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentId": "5746c781-df7f-4c87-84a7-65a119880560"
          }

       Example 2: To deploy a Rails App and Migrate the Database

       The  following create-deployment command deploys a Ruby on Rails app to
       a specified stack and migrates the database.

          aws opsworks create-deployment \
              --stack-id cfb7e082-ad1d-4599-8e81-de1c39ab45bf \
              --app-id 307be5c8-d55d-47b5-bd6e-7bd417c6c7eb \
              --command "{\"Name\":\"deploy\", \"Args\":{\"migrate\":[\"true\"]}}"

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentId": "5746c781-df7f-4c87-84a7-65a119880560"
          }

       For more information on deployment,  see  Deploying  Apps  in  the  AWS
       OpsWorks User Guide.

       Example 3: Run a Recipe

       The  following  create-deployment  command  runs  a  custom recipe, ph-
       papp::appsetup, on the instances in a specified stack.

          aws opsworks create-deployment \
              --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb \
              --command "{\"Name\":\"execute_recipes\", \"Args\":{\"recipes\":[\"phpapp::appsetup\"]}}"

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentId": "5cbaa7b9-4e09-4e53-aa1b-314fbd106038"
          }

       For more information, see Run Stack Commands in the AWS  OpsWorks  User
       Guide.

       Example 4: Install Dependencies

       The  following create-deployment command installs dependencies, such as
       packages or Ruby gems, on the instances in a specified stack.

          aws opsworks create-deployment \
              --stack-id 935450cc-61e0-4b03-a3e0-160ac817d2bb \
              --command "{\"Name\":\"install_dependencies\"}"

       Output:

          {
              "DeploymentId": "aef5b255-8604-4928-81b3-9b0187f962ff"
          }

       For more information, see Run Stack Commands in the AWS  OpsWorks  User
       Guide.

OUTPUT
       DeploymentId -> (string)
          The deployment ID, which can be used with other requests to identify
          the deployment.
