NAME
       create-user-profile -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a new user profile.
          Required  Permissions : To use this action, an IAM user must have an
          attached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more  infor-
          mation about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-user-profile
          --iam-user-arn <value>
          [--ssh-username <value>]
          [--ssh-public-key <value>]
          [--allow-self-management | --no-allow-self-management]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --iam-user-arn (string)
          The user's IAM ARN; this can also be a federated user's ARN.

       --ssh-username (string)
          The user's SSH user name. The allowable characters are [a-z], [A-Z],
          [0-9], '-', and '_'. If the specified name includes  other  punctua-
          tion  marks,  AWS OpsWorks Stacks removes them. For example, my.name
          will be changed to myname . If you do not specify an SSH user  name,
          AWS OpsWorks Stacks generates one from the IAM user name.

       --ssh-public-key (string)
          The user's public SSH key.

       --allow-self-management | --no-allow-self-management (boolean)
          Whether  users  can  specify their own SSH public key through the My
          Settings page. For more information, see Setting an IAM User's  Pub-
          lic SSH Key .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a user profile

       You import an AWS Identity and  Access  Manager  (IAM)  user  into  AWS
       OpsWorks  by calling create-user-profile to create a user profile.  The
       following example creates a user  profile  for  the  cli-user-test  IAM
       user,  who is identified by Amazon Resource Name (ARN). The example as-
       signs the user an SSH username of myusername and enables  self  manage-
       ment, which allows the user to specify an SSH public key.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 create-user-profile --iam-user-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789102:user/cli-user-test --ssh-username myusername --allow-self-management

       Output:

          {
            "IamUserArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789102:user/cli-user-test"
          }

       Tip:  This command imports an IAM user into AWS OpsWorks, but only with
       the permissions that are granted by  the  attached  policies.  You  can
       grant  per-stack  AWS OpsWorks permissions by using the set-permissions
       command.

       More Information

       For more information, see Importing Users into AWS OpsWorks in the  AWS
       OpsWorks User Guide.

OUTPUT
       IamUserArn -> (string)
          The user's IAM ARN.
