NAME
       describe-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of a set of instances.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          A stack ID. If you use this parameter, DescribeInstances returns de-
          scriptions of the instances associated with the specified stack.

       --layer-id (string)
          A layer ID. If you use this parameter, DescribeInstances returns de-
          scriptions of the instances associated with the specified layer.

       --instance-ids (list)
          An array of instance IDs to be described. If you use this parameter,
          DescribeInstances  returns a description of the specified instances.
          Otherwise, it returns a description of every instance.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe instances

       The following describe-instances command describes the instances  in  a
       specified stack:

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-instances --stack-id 8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8

       Output: The following output example is for a stack with two instances.
       The first is a registered EC2 instance, and the second was  created  by
       AWS OpsWorks.

                            If  you specify the io1 volume type, you must also
                            specify a value for the Iops attribute. The  maxi-
                            mum  ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volume
                            size (in GiB) is 50:1. Amazon  Web  Services  uses
                            the  default volume size (in GiB) specified in the
                            AMI attributes to set IOPS to 50 x (volume size).

                        DeleteOnTermination -> (boolean)

                 The ID of the associated Amazon EC2 instance.

              EcsClusterArn -> (string)
                 For container instances, the Amazon ECS cluster's ARN.

              EcsContainerInstanceArn -> (string)
                 For container instances, the instance's ARN.

                 Whether  to install operating system and package updates when
                 the instance boots. The default value is true . If this value
                 is set to false , you must update instances manually by using
                 CreateDeployment to run the update_dependencies stack command
                 or by manually running yum (Amazon Linux) or apt-get (Ubuntu)
                 on the instances.

                 NOTE:
                     We strongly recommend using the default value of true  to
                     ensure  that  your instances have the latest security up-
                     dates.
