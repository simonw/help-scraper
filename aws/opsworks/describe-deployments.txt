NAME
       describe-deployments -

DESCRIPTION
       Requests a description of a specified set of deployments.

       NOTE:
              This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-deployments
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--app-id <value>]
          [--deployment-ids <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID. If you include this parameter, the command  returns  a
          description of the commands associated with the specified stack.

       --app-id (string)
          The app ID. If you include this parameter, the command returns a de-
          scription of the commands associated with the specified app.

       --deployment-ids (list)
          An array of deployment IDs to be described. If you include this  pa-
          rameter,  the command returns a description of the specified deploy-
          ments. Otherwise, it returns a description of every deployment.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe deployments

       The following describe-deployments commmand describes  the  deployments
       in a specified stack.

              Command -> (structure)
                 Used to specify a stack or deployment command.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Specifies the operation. You can specify  only  one  com-
                     mand.

                     For stacks, the following commands are available:

                     o execute_recipes : Execute one or more recipes. To spec-
                       ify the recipes, set an Args parameter named recipes to
                       the list of recipes to be executed. For example, to ex-
                       ecute phpapp::appsetup , set Args  to  {"recipes":["ph-
                       papp::appsetup"]} .

                     o install_dependencies  :  Install  the stack's dependen-
                       cies.

                     o update_custom_cookbooks :  Update  the  stack's  custom
                       cookbooks.

                     o update_dependencies : Update the stack's dependencies.

                     NOTE:
                        The  update_dependencies and install_dependencies com-
                        mands are supported only for Linux instances. You  can
                        run  the  commands  successfully on Windows instances,
                        but they do nothing.

                     For apps, the following commands are available:

                     o deploy : Deploy an app. Ruby on Rails apps have an  op-
                       tional Args parameter named migrate . Set Args to {"mi-
                       grate":["true"]} to migrate the database.  The  default
                       setting is {"migrate":["false"]}.

                     o rollback  Roll  the  app  back to the previous version.
                       When you update an app, AWS OpsWorks Stacks stores  the
                       previous version, up to a maximum of five versions. You
                       can use this command to roll an app  back  as  many  as
                       four versions.

                     o start : Start the app's web or application server.

                     o stop : Stop the app's web or application server.

                     o restart : Restart the app's web or application server.

                     o undeploy : Undeploy the app.

                 Args -> (map)
                     The  arguments  of those commands that take arguments. It
                     should be set to a JSON object with the following format:
                        {"arg_name1" : ["value1", "value2", ...],  "arg_name2"
                        : ["value1", "value2", ...], ...}

                     The update_dependencies command takes two arguments:

                     o upgrade_os_to - Specifies the desired Amazon Linux ver-
                       sion for instances whose OS you want to  upgrade,  such
                       as  Amazon  Linux  2016.09  . You must also set the al-
                       low_reboot argument to true.

                     o allow_reboot - Specifies whether to allow AWS  OpsWorks
                       Stacks  to reboot the instances if necessary, after in-
                       stalling the updates. This argument can be set  to  ei-
                       ther true or false . The default value is false .

                     For  example,  to  upgrade  an  instance  to Amazon Linux
                     2016.09, set Args to the following.
                        { "upgrade_os_to":["Amazon Linux 2016.09"], "allow_re-
                        boot":["true"] }

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)
                        (string)

              Status -> (string)
                 The deployment status:

                 o running

                 o successful

                 o failed

              CustomJson -> (string)
                 A  string  that  contains user-defined custom JSON. It can be
                 used to override the corresponding default  stack  configura-
                 tion  attribute  values for stack or to pass data to recipes.
                 The string should be in the following format:
                     "{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\",...}"

                 For more information on custom JSON, see Use Custom  JSON  to
                 Modify the Stack Configuration Attributes .

              InstanceIds -> (list)
                 The IDs of the target instances.

                 (string)
