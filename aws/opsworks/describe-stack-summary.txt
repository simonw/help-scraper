DESCRIBE-STACK-SUMMARY()                              DESCRIBE-STACK-SUMMARY()



NAME
       describe-stack-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  number of layers and apps in a specified stack, and the
       number of instances in each state, such as running_setup or online .
          Required Permissions : To use this action, an IAM user must  have  a
          Show,  Deploy,  or Manage permissions level for the stack, or an at-
          tached policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more  informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-summary
          --stack-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The stack ID.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a stack's configuration

       The  following  describe-stack-summary command returns a summary of the
       specified stack's configuration.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-stack-summary --stack-id 8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8

       Output:

          {
            "StackSummary": {
              "StackId": "8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8",
              "InstancesCount": {
                "Booting": 1
              },
              "Name": "CLITest",
              "AppsCount": 1,
              "LayersCount": 1,
              "Arn": "arn:aws:opsworks:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/8c428b08-a1a1-46ce-a5f8-feddc43771b8/"
