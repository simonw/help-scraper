DESCRIBE-RDS-DB-INSTANCES()                        DESCRIBE-RDS-DB-INSTANCES()



NAME
       describe-rds-db-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes Amazon RDS instances.
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack, or  an  at-
          tached  policy that explicitly grants permissions. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-rds-db-instances
          --stack-id <value>
          [--rds-db-instance-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-id (string)
          The ID of the stack with which the instances are registered. The op-
          eration returns descriptions of all registered Amazon RDS instances.

       --rds-db-instance-arns (list)
          An array containing the ARNs of the instances to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a stack's registered Amazon RDS instances

       The following example describes the  Amazon  RDS  instances  registered
       with a specified stack.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 describe-rds-db-instances --stack-id d72553d4-8727-448c-9b00-f024f0ba1b06

       Output: The following is the output for a stack with one registered RDS
       instance.

          {
            "RdsDbInstances": [
              {
                "Engine": "mysql",
                "StackId": "d72553d4-8727-448c-9b00-f024f0ba1b06",
                "MissingOnRds": false,
                "Region": "us-west-2",
                "RdsDbInstanceArn": "arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:db:clitestdb",
                "DbPassword": "*****FILTERED*****",
                "Address": "clitestdb.cdlqlk5uwd0k.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
                "DbUser": "cliuser",
                "DbInstanceIdentifier": "clitestdb"
              }
            ]
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       RdsDbInstances -> (list)
          An a array of RdsDbInstance objects that describe the instances.

          (structure)
              Describes an Amazon RDS instance.

              RdsDbInstanceArn -> (string)
                 The instance's ARN.

              DbInstanceIdentifier -> (string)
                 The DB instance identifier.

              DbUser -> (string)
                 The master user name.

              DbPassword -> (string)
                 AWS OpsWorks Stacks returns *****FILTERED***** instead of the
                 actual value.

              Region -> (string)
                 The instance's AWS region.

              Address -> (string)
                 The instance's address.

              Engine -> (string)
                 The instance's database engine.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack with which the instance is registered.

              MissingOnRds -> (boolean)
                 Set to true if AWS OpsWorks Stacks is unable to discover  the
                 Amazon RDS instance. AWS OpsWorks Stacks attempts to discover
                 the instance only once. If this value is set to  true  ,  you
                 must deregister the instance, and then register it again.
