SET-LOAD-BASED-AUTO-SCALING()                    SET-LOAD-BASED-AUTO-SCALING()



NAME
       set-load-based-auto-scaling -

DESCRIPTION
       Specify  the  load-based  auto  scaling  configuration  for a specified
       layer. For more information, see  Managing  Load  with  Time-based  and
       Load-based Instances .

       NOTE:
              To  use  load-based  auto  scaling,  you  must  create  a set of
              load-based auto scaling instances. Load-based auto scaling oper-
              ates  only  on  the  instances from that set, so you must ensure
              that you have created enough instances to handle the maximum an-
              ticipated load.

          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Manage permissions level for the stack, or an attached  policy  that
          explicitly  grants permissions. For more information on user permis-
          sions, see Managing User Permissions .

SYNOPSIS
            set-load-based-auto-scaling
          --layer-id <value>
          [--enable | --no-enable]
          [--up-scaling <value>]
          [--down-scaling <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --layer-id (string)
          The layer ID.

       --enable | --no-enable (boolean)
          Enables load-based auto scaling for the layer.

       --up-scaling (structure)
          An AutoScalingThresholds object with the upscaling threshold config-
          uration. If the load exceeds these thresholds for a specified amount
          of time, AWS OpsWorks Stacks starts a specified number of instances.

          InstanceCount -> (integer)
              The number of instances to add or remove when the load exceeds a
              threshold.

          ThresholdsWaitTime -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time,  in  minutes, that the load must exceed a
              threshold before more instances are added or removed.

          IgnoreMetricsTime -> (integer)
              The amount of time (in minutes) after  a  scaling  event  occurs
              that  AWS OpsWorks Stacks should ignore metrics and suppress ad-
              ditional scaling events. For example, AWS OpsWorks  Stacks  adds
              new  instances  following  an  upscaling event but the instances
              won't start reducing the load until they have  been  booted  and
              configured.  There  is  no  point  in raising additional scaling
              events during that operation, which typically takes several min-
              utes. IgnoreMetricsTime allows you to direct AWS OpsWorks Stacks
              to suppress scaling events long enough to get the new  instances
              online.

          CpuThreshold -> (double)
              The  CPU  utilization  threshold,  as a percent of the available
              CPU. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

          MemoryThreshold -> (double)
              The memory utilization threshold, as a percent of the  available
              memory. A value of -1 disables the threshold.

          LoadThreshold -> (double)
              The  load  threshold.  A value of -1 disables the threshold. For
              more information about how load is computed, see  Load  (comput-
              ing) .

          Alarms -> (list)
              Custom Cloudwatch auto scaling alarms, to be used as thresholds.
              This parameter takes a list of up to five alarm names, which are
              case sensitive and must be in the same region as the stack.

              NOTE:
                 To  use  custom  alarms, you must update your service role to
                 allow cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms . You  can  either  have  AWS
                 OpsWorks  Stacks  update  the role for you when you first use
                 this feature or you can edit the role manually. For more  in-
                 formation,  see  Allowing  AWS OpsWorks Stacks to Act on Your
                 Behalf .

          }

       --down-scaling (structure)
          An AutoScalingThresholds object with the downscaling threshold  con-
          figuration. If the load falls below these thresholds for a specified
          amount of time, AWS OpsWorks Stacks stops a specified number of  in-

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To set the load-based scaling configuration for a layer

       The following example enables load-based scaling for a specified  layer
       and  sets  the  configuration  for that layer.  You must use create-in-
       stance to add load-based instances to the layer.

          aws opsworks --region us-east-1 set-load-based-auto-scaling --layer-id 523569ae-2faf-47ac-b39e-f4c4b381f36d --enable --up-scaling file://upscale.json --down-scaling file://downscale.json

       The example puts the upscaling threshold settings in a separate file in
       the working directory named upscale.json, which contains the following.

          {
            "InstanceCount": 2,
            "ThresholdsWaitTime": 3,
            "IgnoreMetricsTime": 3,
            "CpuThreshold": 85,
            "MemoryThreshold": 85,
            "LoadThreshold": 85
          }

       The  example puts the downscaling threshold settings in a separate file
       in the working directory named downscale.json, which contains the  fol-
       lowing.

          {
          "InstanceCount": 2,
          "ThresholdsWaitTime": 3,
          "IgnoreMetricsTime": 3,
          "CpuThreshold": 35,
          "MemoryThreshold": 30,
          "LoadThreshold": 30
          }

       Output: None.

OUTPUT
       None
