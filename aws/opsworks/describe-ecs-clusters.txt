DESCRIBE-ECS-CLUSTERS()                                DESCRIBE-ECS-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-ecs-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  Amazon ECS clusters that are registered with a stack. If you
       specify only a stack ID, you can use the MaxResults and  NextToken  pa-
       rameters  to  paginate  the response. However, AWS OpsWorks Stacks cur-
       rently supports only one cluster per layer, so the  result  set  has  a
       maximum of one element.
          Required  Permissions  : To use this action, an IAM user must have a
          Show, Deploy, or Manage permissions level for the stack  or  an  at-
          tached  policy  that explicitly grants permission. For more informa-
          tion about user permissions, see Managing User Permissions .

       This call accepts only one resource-identifying parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-ecs-clusters is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: EcsClusters

SYNOPSIS
            describe-ecs-clusters
          [--ecs-cluster-arns <value>]
          [--stack-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ecs-cluster-arns (list)
          A list of ARNs, one for each cluster to be described.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-id (string)
          A stack ID. DescribeEcsClusters returns a description of the cluster
          that is registered with the stack.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EcsClusters -> (list)
          A list of EcsCluster objects containing the cluster descriptions.

          (structure)
              Describes a registered Amazon ECS cluster.

              EcsClusterArn -> (string)
                 The cluster's ARN.

              EcsClusterName -> (string)
                 The cluster name.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The stack ID.

              RegisteredAt -> (string)
                 The time and date that the cluster was  registered  with  the
                 stack.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If a paginated request does not return all of the remaining results,
          this parameter is set to a token that you can assign to the  request
          object's NextToken parameter to retrieve the next set of results. If
          the previous paginated request returned all  of  the  remaining  re-
          sults, this parameter is set to null .
