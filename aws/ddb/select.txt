SELECT()                                                              SELECT()



NAME
       select -

DESCRIPTION
       select searches a table or index.

       Under  the  hood,  this  operation will use query if --key-condition is
       specified, or scan otherwise.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            select
          <table-name>
          [--index-name <value>]
          [--projection <value> [<value>...]]
          [--filter <value> [<value>...]]
          [--key-condition <value> [<value>...]]
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--consistent-read | --no-consistent-read]
          [--return-consumed-capacity | --no-return-consumed-capacity]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]

OPTIONS
       table_name (string)
          The name of your DynamoDB table.

       --index-name (string)
          The name of a secondary index to scan. This index can be  any  local
          secondary index or global secondary index.

       --projection (string)
          A string that identifies one or more attributes to retrieve from the
          specified table or index.  These  attributes  can  include  scalars,
          sets,  or elements of a JSON document. The attributes in the expres-
          sion must be separated by commas. If any of the requested attributes
          are not found, they will not appear in the result.

          For  more  information,  see Accessing Item Attributes in the Amazon
          DynamoDB Developer Guide .

          For CLI specific syntax see aws help ddb-expressions

       --filter (string)
          A string that contains conditions that DynamoDB  applies  after  the
          operation, but before the data is returned to you. Items that do not
          satisfy the --filter criteria are not returned.

          NOTE:
              A --filter is applied after the items have  already  been  read;
              the  process  of  filtering does not consume any additional read
              capacity units.

          For more information, see Filter Expressions in the Amazon  DynamoDB
          Developer Guide .

          For CLI specific syntax see aws help ddb-expressions

       --key-condition (string)
          The  condition  that  specifies the key value(s) for items to be re-
          trieved. Must perform an equality test on  a  single  partition  key
          value.

          The condition can optionally perform one of several comparison tests
          on a single sort key value. This allows select to retrieve one  item
          with  a  given  partition  key  value and sort key value, or several
          items that have the same partition key value but different sort  key
          values.

          The  partition  key equality test must be specified in the following
          format:

          partitionKeyName = :partitionkeyval

          If you also want to provide a condition for the sort key, it must be
          combined using AND with the condition for the sort key.

          Valid comparisons for the sort key condition are as follows:

          o sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to
            :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName < :sortkeyval - true if the sort  key  value  is  less
            than :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName  <=  :sortkeyval  - true if the sort key value is less
            than or equal to :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName > :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is  greater
            than :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName >= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater
            than or equal to :sortkeyval .

          o sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1 AND :sortkeyval2 -  true  if  the
            sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1 , and less
            than or equal to :sortkeyval2 .

          o begins_with(sortKeyName, :sortkeyval) - true if the sort key value
            begins  with  a  particular operand. (You cannot use this function
            with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note  that  the  function
            name begins_with is case-sensitive.

          For CLI specific syntax see aws help ddb-expressions

       --attributes (string)
          The  attributes  to  be returned in the result. You can retrieve all
          item attributes, specific item attributes,  the  count  of  matching
          items,  or  in  the  case of an index, some or all of the attributes
          projected into the index.

          o ALL - Returns all of the item attributes from the specified  table
            or  index.  If  you  query  a local secondary index, then for each
            matching item in the index DynamoDB will  fetch  the  entire  item
            from  the  parent table. If the index is configured to project all
            item attributes, then all of the data can be obtained from the lo-
            cal secondary index, and no fetching is required.

          o ALL_PROJECTED - Allowed only when querying an index. Retrieves all
            attributes that have been projected into the index. If  the  index
            is  configured  to  project  all  attributes, this return value is
            equivalent to specifying ALL.

          o COUNT - Returns the number of  matching  items,  rather  than  the
            matching items themselves.

       --consistent-read | --no-consistent-read (boolean)
          Determines the read consistency model: If set to --consistent-read ,
          then the operation uses strongly consistent  reads;  otherwise,  the
          operation  uses  eventually  consistent  reads.  Strongly consistent
          reads are not supported on global secondary indexes. If you query  a
          global  secondary  index with --consistent-read , you will receive a
          ValidationException .

       --return-consumed-capacity | --no-return-consumed-capacity (boolean)
          Will include the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for  the  operation.  If
          --index-name  is  also specified, then the ConsumedCapacity for each
          table and secondary index that was accessed will be returned.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To scan an entire table

       This  example  scans the entire MusicCollection table, and then narrows
       the results to songs by the artist "No One You Know".  For  each  item,
       only the album title and song title are returned.

       Command:

          aws ddb select MusicCollection --projection 'SongTitle, AlbumTitle' \
              --filter 'Artist = "No One You Know"'

       Output:

          Count: 2
          Items:
          - SongTitle: "Call Me Today"
            AlbumTitle: "Somewhat Famous"
          - SongTitle: "Scared of My Shadow"
            AlbumTitle: "Blue Sky Blues"
          ScannedCount: 3

       To query for specific primary keys

       This  example queries items in the MusicCollection table. The table has
       a hash-and-range primary key (Artist and  SongTitle),  but  this  query
       only specifies the hash key value. It returns song titles by the artist
       named "No One You Know".

       Command:

          aws ddb select MusicCollection --projection SongTitle \
              --key-condition 'Artist = "No One You Know"'

       Output:

          Count: 2
          Items:
          - SongTitle: "Call Me Today"
          - SongTitle: "Scared of My Shadow"
          ScannedCount: 2
