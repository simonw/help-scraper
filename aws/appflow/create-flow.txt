CREATE-FLOW()                                                    CREATE-FLOW()



NAME
       create-flow -

DESCRIPTION
       Enables your application to create a new flow using Amazon AppFlow. You
       must create a connector profile before calling this  API.  Please  note
       that  the  Request Syntax below shows syntax for multiple destinations,
       however, you can only transfer data to one item in this list at a time.
       Amazon  AppFlow  does  not currently support flows to multiple destina-
       tions at once.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
