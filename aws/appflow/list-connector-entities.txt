NAME
       list-connector-entities -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  list  of available connector entities supported by Amazon
       AppFlow. For example, you can query Salesforce for Account and Opportu-
       nity entities, or query ServiceNow for the Incident entity.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-connector-entities
          [--connector-profile-name <value>]
          [--connector-type <value>]
          [--entities-path <value>]

OPTIONS
       --connector-profile-name (string)
          The  name of the connector profile. The name is unique for each Con-

          query the downstream connector.

       --connector-type (string)
          The type of connector, such as Salesforce, Amplitude, and so on.

       --entities-path (string)
          This  optional  parameter  is  specific to connector implementation.
          Some connectors support multiple levels or categories  of  entities.
          You  can  find out the list of roots for such providers by sending a
          request without the entitiesPath parameter. If  the  connector  sup-
          ports  entities at different roots, this initial request returns the
          list of roots. Otherwise, this request  returns  all  entities  sup-
          ported by the provider.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       connectorEntityMap -> (map)
          The response of ListConnectorEntities lists entities grouped by cat-
          egory.  This map's key represents the group name, and its value con-
          tains the list of entities belonging to that group.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (structure)
                 The high-level entity that can be queried in Amazon  AppFlow.
                 For  example,  a Salesforce entity might be an Account or Op-
                 portunity , whereas a ServiceNow entity might be an  Incident
                 .

                 name -> (string)
                     The name of the connector entity.

                 label -> (string)
                     The label applied to the connector entity.

                 hasNestedEntities -> (boolean)
                     Specifies  whether  the connector entity is a parent or a
                     category and has more entities nested underneath  it.  If
                     another call is made with entitiesPath = "the_current_en-
                     tity_name_with_hasNestedEntities_true" , then it  returns
                     the nested entities underneath it. This provides a way to
                     retrieve all supported entities in a recursive fashion.
