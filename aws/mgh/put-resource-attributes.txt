PUT-RESOURCE-ATTRIBUTES()                            PUT-RESOURCE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       put-resource-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides  identifying details of the resource being migrated so that it
       can be associated in the Application Discovery Service repository. This
       association occurs asynchronously after PutResourceAttributes returns.

       WARNING:

          o Keep  in  mind that subsequent calls to PutResourceAttributes will
            override previously stored attributes. For example, if it is first
            called  with  a MAC address, but later, it is desired to add an IP
            address, it will then be required to call it with both the IP  and
            MAC addresses to prevent overriding the MAC address.

          o Note  the instructions regarding the special use case of the ` Re-
            sourceAttributeList
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/migrationhub/latest/ug/API_PutResourceAttributes.html#migrationhub-PutResourceAttributes-request-ResourceAttributeList`__
            parameter when specifying any "VM" related value.

       NOTE:
          Because this is an asynchronous call, it  will  always  return  200,
          whether  an  association occurs or not. To confirm if an association
          was  found  based  on  the  provided  details,  call  ListDiscovere-
          dResources .

SYNOPSIS
            put-resource-attributes
          --progress-update-stream <value>
          --migration-task-name <value>
          --resource-attribute-list <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream (string)
          The name of the ProgressUpdateStream.

       --migration-task-name (string)
          Unique  identifier  that references the migration task. Do not store
          personal data in this field.

       --resource-attribute-list (list)
          Information about the resource that is  being  migrated.  This  data
          will  be  used to map the task to a resource in the Application Dis-
          covery Service repository.

          NOTE:
              Takes the object array of ResourceAttribute where the Type field
              is  reserved  for  the following values: IPV4_ADDRESS | IPV6_AD-
              DRESS | MAC_ADDRESS |  FQDN  |  VM_MANAGER_ID  |  VM_MANAGED_OB-
              JECT_REFERENCE  |  VM_NAME | VM_PATH | BIOS_ID | MOTHERBOARD_SE-
              RIAL_NUMBER where the identifying value can be a  string  up  to
              256 characters.

          WARNING:

              o If  any  "VM" related value is set for a ResourceAttribute ob-
                ject, it is required that VM_MANAGER_ID , as a minimum, is al-
                ways  set.  If  VM_MANAGER_ID is not set, then all "VM" fields
                will be discarded and "VM" fields will not be used for  match-
                ing  the  migration  task to a server in Application Discovery
                Service repository. See the Example section below  for  a  use
                case of specifying "VM" related values.

              o If a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC ad-
                dresses, you should provide as many as you  know  in  separate
                type/value pairs passed to the ResourceAttributeList parameter
                to maximize the chances of matching.

          (structure)
              Attribute associated with a resource.

              Note the corresponding format required per type listed below:
                     IPV4

                 x.x.x.x

                 where x is an integer in the range [0,255]
                     IPV6

                 y : y : y : y : y : y : y : y

                 where y is a hexadecimal between 0 and FFFF. [0, FFFF]
                     MAC_ADDRESS

                 ^([0-9A-Fa-f]{2}[:-]){5}([0-9A-Fa-f]{2})$
                     FQDN

                 ^[^<>{}\\\\/?,=\\p{Cntrl}]{1,256}$

              Type -> (string)
                 Type of resource.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the resource type.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Type=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Type": "IPV4_ADDRESS"|"IPV6_ADDRESS"|"MAC_ADDRESS"|"FQDN"|"VM_MANAGER_ID"|"VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE"|"VM_NAME"|"VM_PATH"|"BIOS_ID"|"MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional boolean flag to indicate whether  any  effect  should  take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
