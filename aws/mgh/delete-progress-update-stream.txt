DELETE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()                DELETE-PROGRESS-UPDATE-STREAM()



NAME
       delete-progress-update-stream -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes a progress update stream, including all of its tasks, which was
       previously created as an AWS resource used for access control. This API
       has the following traits:

       o The  only  parameter  needed  for  DeleteProgressUpdateStream  is the
         stream name (same as a CreateProgressUpdateStream call).

       o The call will return, and a background  process  will  asynchronously
         delete  the  stream  and  all of its resources (tasks, associated re-
         sources, resource attributes, created artifacts).

       o If the stream takes time to be deleted, it might still show up  on  a
         ListProgressUpdateStreams call.

       o CreateProgressUpdateStream   ,   ImportMigrationTask  ,  NotifyMigra-
         tionTaskState , and all Associate[*] APIs related to  the  tasks  be-
         longing  to  the  stream  will  throw  "InvalidInputException" if the
         stream of the same name is in the process of being deleted.

       o Once the stream and all of its resources are deleted,  CreateProgres-
         sUpdateStream  for  a  stream of the same name will succeed, and that
         stream will be an entirely new  logical  resource  (without  any  re-
         sources associated with the old stream).

SYNOPSIS
            delete-progress-update-stream
          --progress-update-stream-name <value>
          [--dry-run | --no-dry-run]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --progress-update-stream-name (string)
          The  name of the ProgressUpdateStream. Do not store personal data in
          this field.

       --dry-run | --no-dry-run (boolean)
          Optional boolean flag to indicate whether  any  effect  should  take
          place. Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
