SEARCH-TABLES-BY-LF-TAGS()                          SEARCH-TABLES-BY-LF-TAGS()



NAME
       search-tables-by-lf-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       This operation allows a search on TABLE resources by LFTag s. This will
       be used by admins  who  want  to  grant  user  permissions  on  certain
       LF-tags.  Before making a grant, the admin can use SearchTablesByLFTags
       to find all resources where the given  LFTag  s  are  valid  to  verify
       whether the returned resources can be shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-tables-by-lf-tags  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: TableList

SYNOPSIS
            search-tables-by-lf-tags
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --expression (list)
          A  list  of conditions (LFTag structures) to search for in table re-
          sources.

          (structure)
              A structure that allows an admin to grant  user  permissions  on
              certain  conditions.  For example, granting a role access to all
              columns that do not have the LF-tag 'PII' in  tables  that  have
              the LF-tag 'Prod'.

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key-name for the LF-tag.

              TagValues -> (list)
                 A list of possible values an attribute can take.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
