SEARCH-DATABASES-BY-LF-TAGS()                    SEARCH-DATABASES-BY-LF-TAGS()



NAME
       search-databases-by-lf-tags -

DESCRIPTION
       This  operation allows a search on DATABASE resources by TagCondition .
       This operation is used by admins who want to grant user permissions  on
       certain  TagConditions  .  Before  making  a  grant,  the admin can use
       SearchDatabasesByTags to find all resources where the  given  TagCondi-
       tions are valid to verify whether the returned resources can be shared.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-databases-by-lf-tags  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: DatabaseList

SYNOPSIS
            search-databases-by-lf-tags
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --expression <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --expression (list)
          A  list  of  conditions (LFTag structures) to search for in database
          resources.

          (structure)
              A structure that allows an admin to grant  user  permissions  on
              certain  conditions.  For example, granting a role access to all
              columns that do not have the LF-tag 'PII' in  tables  that  have
              the LF-tag 'Prod'.

              TagKey -> (string)
                 The key-name for the LF-tag.

              TagValues -> (list)
                 A list of possible values an attribute can take.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TagKey=string,TagValues=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "TagKey": "string",
              "TagValues": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token, present if the current list segment is not the
          last.

          (structure)

                 A database that has LF-tags attached to it.

                 CatalogId -> (string)
                     The identifier for the Data Catalog. By  default,  it  is
                     the account ID of the caller.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The  name  of  the  database resource. Unique to the Data
                     Catalog.

                     CatalogId -> (string)
                        The identifier for the Data Catalog. By  default,  the
                        account  ID.  The Data Catalog is the persistent meta-
                        data store. It contains  database  definitions,  table
                        definitions,  and  other control information to manage
                        your Lake Formation environment.

                        The key-name for the LF-tag.

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        A list of possible values an attribute can take.
