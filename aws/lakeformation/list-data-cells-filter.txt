LIST-DATA-CELLS-FILTER()                              LIST-DATA-CELLS-FILTER()



NAME
       list-data-cells-filter -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all the data cell filters on a table.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-data-cells-filter is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DataCellsFilters

SYNOPSIS
            list-data-cells-filter
          [--table <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --table (structure)
          A table in the Glue Data Catalog.

          CatalogId -> (string)
              The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, it is  the  ac-
              count ID of the caller.

          DatabaseName -> (string)
              The  name  of the database for the table. Unique to a Data Cata-
              log. A database is a set of associated table  definitions  orga-
              nized  into  a  logical group. You can Grant and Revoke database
              privileges to a principal.

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the table.

          TableWildcard -> (structure)
              A wildcard object representing every table under a database.

              At least one of TableResource$Name  or  TableResource$TableWild-
              card is required.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CatalogId=string,DatabaseName=string,Name=string,TableWildcard={}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CatalogId": "string",
            "DatabaseName": "string",
            "Name": "string",
            "TableWildcard": {

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 You must specify either a ColumnNames list or the ColumnWild-
                 Card .

                 ExcludedColumnNames -> (list)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  continuation  token,  if not all requested data cell filters have
          been returned.
