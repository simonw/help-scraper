LIST-PERMISSIONS()                                          LIST-PERMISSIONS()



NAME
       list-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the principal permissions on the resource, filtered
       by the permissions of the caller. For example, if you  are  granted  an
       ALTER  permission,  you  are able to see only the principal permissions
       for ALTER.

       This operation returns only those permissions that have been explicitly
       granted.

       For  information  about permissions, see Security and Access Control to
       Metadata and Data .

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

          Specifies a principal to filter the permissions returned.

          DataLakePrincipalIdentifier -> (string)
              An identifier for the Lake Formation principal.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          DataLakePrincipalIdentifier=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          This  operation  does not support getting privileges on a table with
