NAME
       get-temporary-glue-table-credentials -

DESCRIPTION
       Allows  a  caller in a secure environment to assume a role with permis-
       sion to access Amazon S3. In order to vend such credentials, Lake  For-
       mation  assumes the role associated with a registered location, for ex-
       ample an Amazon S3 bucket, with a scope down policy which restricts the
       access to a single prefix.

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AdditionalAuditContext": "string"
          }

       --supported-permission-types (list)
          A list of supported permission types for the table. Valid values are
          COLUMN_PERMISSION and CELL_FILTER_PERMISSION .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
