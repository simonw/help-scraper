GET-WORK-UNITS()                                              GET-WORK-UNITS()



NAME
       get-work-units -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the work units generated by the StartQueryPlanning operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-work-units  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: WorkUnitRanges

SYNOPSIS
            get-work-units
          [--page-size <value>]
          --query-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --query-id (string)
          The ID of the plan query operation.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          A continuation token for paginating the returned list of tokens, re-
          turned if the current segment of the list is not the last.

       QueryId -> (string)
          The ID of the plan query operation.

       WorkUnitRanges -> (list)
          A  WorkUnitRangeList  object  that specifies the valid range of work
          unit IDs for querying the execution service.

          (structure)
              Defines the valid range of work unit IDs for querying the execu-
              tion service.

              WorkUnitIdMax -> (long)
                 Defines  the  maximum  work unit ID in the range. The maximum
                 value is inclusive.

              WorkUnitIdMin -> (long)
                 Defines the minimum work unit ID in the range.

              WorkUnitToken -> (string)
                 A work token used to query the execution service.
