SYNOPSIS
            get-table-objects
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--transaction-id <value>]
          [--query-as-of-time <value>]
          [--partition-predicate <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  catalog  containing the governed table. Defaults to the callers
          account.

       --database-name (string)
          The database containing the governed table.

       --table-name (string)
          The governed table for which to retrieve objects.

       --transaction-id (string)
          The transaction ID at which to read the governed table contents.  If
          this  transaction has aborted, an error is returned. If not set, de-
          faults to the most recent committed transaction. Cannot be specified
          along with QueryAsOfTime .

       --query-as-of-time (timestamp)
          The time as of when to read the governed table contents. If not set,
          the most recent transaction commit time is used. Cannot be specified
          along with TransactionId .

       --partition-predicate (string)
          A  predicate  to  filter the objects returned based on the partition
          keys defined in the governed table.

          o The comparison operators supported are: =, >, <, >=, <=

          o The logical operators supported are: AND

          o The data types  supported  are  integer,  long,  date(yyyy-MM-dd),
            timestamp(yyyy-MM-dd  HH:mm:ssXXX or yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"), string
            and decimal.

       --max-results (integer)
          Specifies how many values to return in a page.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token if this is not the first call to retrieve these
          objects.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Objects -> (list)
          A list of objects organized by partition keys.

          (structure)
              A structure containing a list of partition values and table  ob-
              jects.
