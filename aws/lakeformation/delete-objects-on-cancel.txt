DELETE-OBJECTS-ON-CANCEL()                          DELETE-OBJECTS-ON-CANCEL()



NAME
       delete-objects-on-cancel -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  specific  governed  table, provides a list of Amazon S3 objects
       that will be written during the current transaction and that can be au-
       tomatically  deleted if the transaction is canceled. Without this call,
       no Amazon S3 objects are automatically deleted when a transaction  can-
       cels.

       The  Glue  ETL  library function write_dynamic_frame.from_catalog() in-
       cludes an option to  automatically  call  DeleteObjectsOnCancel  before
       writes. For more information, see Rolling Back Amazon S3 Writes .

SYNOPSIS
            delete-objects-on-cancel
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          --transaction-id <value>
          --objects <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The  Glue data catalog that contains the governed table. Defaults to
          the current account ID.

       --database-name (string)
          The database that contains the governed table.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the governed table.

       --transaction-id (string)
          ID of the transaction that the writes occur in.

       --objects (list)
          A list of VirtualObject structures, which indicates  the  Amazon  S3
          objects to be deleted if the transaction cancels.

          (structure)
              An  object  that  defines an Amazon S3 object to be deleted if a
              transaction cancels, provided that VirtualPut was called  before
              writing the object.

              Uri -> (string)
                 The path to the Amazon S3 object. Must start with s3://

              ETag -> (string)
                 The ETag of the Amazon S3 object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Uri=string,ETag=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Uri": "string",
              "ETag": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       None
