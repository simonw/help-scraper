NAME
       get-effective-permissions-for-path -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  Lake Formation permissions for a specified table or data-
       base resource located at a path in Amazon S3.  GetEffectivePermissions-
       ForPath  will  not  return  databases  and tables if the catalog is en-
       crypted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-effective-permissions-for-path
          [--catalog-id <value>]
          --resource-arn <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --catalog-id (string)
          The identifier for the Data Catalog. By default, the account ID. The
          Data  Catalog is the persistent metadata store. It contains database
          definitions, table definitions, and  other  control  information  to
          manage your Lake Formation environment.

       --resource-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource for which you want to
          get permissions.

       --next-token (string)
          A continuation token, if this is not the first call to retrieve this
          list.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to return.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
