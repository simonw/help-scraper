DELETE-CLUSTER()                                              DELETE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  specified  AWS  CloudHSM cluster. Before you can delete a
       cluster, you must delete all HSMs in the cluster. To see if the cluster
       contains  any  HSMs,  use   DescribeClusters  .  To  delete an HSM, use
       DeleteHsm .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-cluster
          --cluster-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-id (string)
          The identifier (ID) of the cluster that you are  deleting.  To  find
          the cluster ID, use  DescribeClusters .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
