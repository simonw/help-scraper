NAME
       modify-backup-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies attributes for AWS CloudHSM backup.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            modify-backup-attributes
          --backup-id <value>
          --never-expires | --no-never-expires
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --backup-id (string)
          The  identifier  (ID)  of  the backup to modify. To find the ID of a
          backup, use the  DescribeBackups operation.

       --never-expires | --no-never-expires (boolean)
          Specifies whether the service should exempt a backup from the reten-
          tion  policy  for the cluster. True exempts a backup from the reten-
          tion policy. False means the service applies  the  backup  retention
          policy defined at the cluster.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Backup -> (structure)
          Contains  information about a backup of an AWS CloudHSM cluster. All
          backup objects contain the BackupId , BackupState , ClusterId ,  and
          CreateTimestamp parameters. Backups that were copied into a destina-
          tion region additionally contain the CopyTimestamp , SourceBackup  ,
          SourceCluster  , and SourceRegion parameters. A backup that is pend-
          ing deletion will include the DeleteTimestamp parameter.

          BackupId -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the backup.

          BackupState -> (string)
              The state of the backup.

          ClusterId -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the cluster that was backed up.

          CreateTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the backup was created.

          CopyTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the  backup  was  copied  from  a  source
              backup.

          NeverExpires -> (boolean)
              Specifies  whether  the  service should exempt a backup from the
              retention policy for the cluster. True exempts a backup from the
              retention policy. False means the service applies the backup re-
              tention policy defined at the cluster.

          SourceRegion -> (string)
              The AWS Region that contains the source backup  from  which  the
              new backup was copied.

          SourceBackup -> (string)
              The  identifier  (ID)  of  the  source backup from which the new
              backup was copied.

          SourceCluster -> (string)
              The identifier (ID) of the cluster containing the source  backup
              from which the new backup was copied.

          DeleteTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The date and time when the backup will be permanently deleted.

          TagList -> (list)
              The list of tags for the backup.

              (structure)
                 Contains a tag. A tag is a key-value pair.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the tag.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the tag.
