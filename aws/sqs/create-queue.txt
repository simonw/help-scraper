CREATE-QUEUE()                                                  CREATE-QUEUE()



NAME
       create-queue -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  new  standard  or  FIFO queue. You can pass one or more at-
       tributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:

       o If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon  SQS  creates  a
         standard queue.

       NOTE:
          You  can't  change  the queue type after you create it and you can't
          convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You  must  ei-
          ther create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your ex-
          isting standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue. For more  in-
          formation,  see  Moving From a Standard Queue to a FIFO Queue in the
          Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       o If you don't provide a value for an attribute, the queue  is  created
         with the default value for the attribute.

       o If  you delete a queue, you must wait at least 60 seconds before cre-
         ating a queue with the same name.

       To successfully create a new queue, you must provide a queue name  that
       adheres  to the limits related to queues and is unique within the scope
       of your queues.

       NOTE:
          After you create a queue, you must wait at least  one  second  after
          the queue is created to be able to use the queue.

       To   get  the  queue  URL,  use  the  ``   GetQueueUrl  ``  action.  ``
       GetQueueUrl `` requires only the QueueName parameter. be aware  of  ex-
       isting queue names:

       o If  you  provide  the  name of an existing queue along with the exact
         names and values of all the queue's attributes,  CreateQueue  returns
         the queue URL for the existing queue.

       o If  the  queue name, attribute names, or attribute values don't match
         an existing queue, CreateQueue returns an error.

       Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified  using
       the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For ex-
       ample, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:
          &AttributeName.1=first

          &AttributeName.2=second

       NOTE:
          Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For  more  in-
          formation,  see Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a user
          name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            create-queue
          --queue-name <value>
          [--attributes <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-name (string)
          The name of the new queue. The following limits apply to this name:

          o A queue name can have up to 80 characters.

          o Valid values: alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-  ),  and  under-
            scores (_ ).

          o A FIFO queue name must end with the .fifo suffix.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes with their corresponding values.

          The  following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the spe-
          cial request parameters that the CreateQueue action uses:

          o DelaySeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for which the deliv-
            ery  of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An in-
            teger from 0 to 900 seconds (15 minutes). Default: 0.

          o MaximumMessageSize  The limit of how many bytes a message can con-
            tain  before  Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An integer from
            1,024 bytes (1 KiB) to 262,144 bytes (256 KiB).  Default:  262,144
            (256 KiB).

          o MessageRetentionPeriod   The length of time, in seconds, for which
            Amazon SQS retains a message. Valid values:  An  integer  from  60
            seconds  (1  minute)  to  1,209,600  seconds  (14  days). Default:
            345,600 (4 days).

          o Policy  The queue's policy. A valid Amazon  Web  Services  policy.
            For  more information about policy structure, see Overview of Ama-
            zon Web Services IAM Policies in the Amazon IAM User Guide .

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for
            which  a  ``   ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to ar-
            rive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.

          o RedrivePolicy  The string that includes  the  parameters  for  the
            dead-letter  queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON ob-
            ject. For more information about the redrive policy and  dead-let-
            ter  queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the Amazon
            SQS Developer Guide .

            o deadLetterTargetArn  The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
              dead-letter  queue  to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount  The number of times a message is  delivered  to
              the  source  queue  before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
              When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the  maxReceiveCount
              for  a  queue,  Amazon  SQS  moves  the message to the dead-let-
              ter-queue.

          NOTE:
              The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
              Similarly,  the  dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also
              be a standard queue.

          o VisibilityTimeout  The visibility timeout for the queue,  in  sec-
            onds.  Valid  values:  An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). De-
            fault: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout,  see
            Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion,  see  Key Terms . While the alias of the Amazon Web Services
            managed CMK for Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs , the alias  of
            a custom CMK can, for example, be
            ``
            alias/MyAlias `` . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Manage-
            ment Service API Reference .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 184)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds  The length of time, in seconds,  for
            which  Amazon  SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt mes-
            sages before calling KMS again. An integer  representing  seconds,
            between  60  seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). De-
            fault: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better  se-
            curity  but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges
            after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the  Data  Key
            Reuse Period Work? .

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled   Enables  server-side queue encryption using
            SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption  option
            is supported per queue (e.g. SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The  following  attributes  apply  only to FIFO (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o FifoQueue  Designates a queue as FIFO. Valid values are  true  and
            false  .  If you don't specify the FifoQueue attribute, Amazon SQS
            creates a standard queue. You can provide this attribute only dur-
            ing  queue  creation.  You  can't change it for an existing queue.
            When you set this attribute, you must also  provide  the  Message-
            GroupId  for  your  messages explicitly. For more information, see
            FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o ContentBasedDeduplication   Enables  content-based  deduplication.
            Valid  values  are  true  and  false  .  For more information, see
            Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide  .  Note
            the following:

            o Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId .

              o You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.

              o If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you
                enable ContentBasedDeduplication for your  queue,  Amazon  SQS
                uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId us-
                ing the body of the message (but not  the  attributes  of  the
                message).

              o If  you  don't  provide a MessageDeduplicationId and the queue
                doesn't have ContentBasedDeduplication set, the  action  fails
                with an error.

              o If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageD-
                eduplicationId overrides the generated one.

            o When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with iden-
              tical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated
              as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

            o If you send one message with  ContentBasedDeduplication  enabled
              and  then  another message with a MessageDeduplicationId that is
              the same as the one generated for  the  first  MessageDeduplica-
              tionId , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one
              copy of the message is delivered.

          The following attributes apply only  to  high  throughput  for  FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit   Specifies  whether the FIFO queue throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues  are  perQueue  and  perMessageGroupId . The perMessageGroupId
            value is allowed only when the  value  for  DeduplicationScope  is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If  you set these attributes to anything other than the values shown
          for enabling high throughput, normal throughput  is  in  effect  and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --tags (map)
          Add cost allocation tags to the specified Amazon SQS queue.  For  an
          overview,  see  Tagging Your Amazon SQS Queues in the Amazon SQS De-
          veloper Guide .

          When you use queue tags, keep the following guidelines in mind:

          o Adding more than 50 tags to a queue isn't recommended.

          o Tags don't have any semantic meaning. Amazon SQS  interprets  tags
            as character strings.

          o Tags are case-sensitive.

          o A  new  tag  with a key identical to that of an existing tag over-
            writes the existing tag.

          For a full list of tag restrictions, see Quotas related to queues in
          the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              To  be  able  to  tag  a  queue  on  creation, you must have the
              sqs:CreateQueue and sqs:TagQueue permissions.

              Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action.  For  more
              information, see Grant cross-account permissions to a role and a
              user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a queue

       This example creates a queue with the specified name, sets the  message
       retention  period  to  3 days (3 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 sec-
       onds), and sets the queue's dead letter queue to  the  specified  queue
       with a maximum receive count of 1,000 messages.

       Command:

          aws sqs create-queue --queue-name MyQueue --attributes file://create-queue.json

       Input file (create-queue.json):

          {
            "RedrivePolicy": "{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MyDeadLetterQueue\",\"maxReceiveCount\":\"1000\"}",
            "MessageRetentionPeriod": "259200"
          }

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrl": "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue"
          }

OUTPUT
       QueueUrl -> (string)
          The URL of the created Amazon SQS queue.
