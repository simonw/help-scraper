DELETE-MESSAGE-BATCH()                                  DELETE-MESSAGE-BATCH()



NAME
       delete-message-batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  up  to  ten messages from the specified queue. This is a batch
       version of ``  DeleteMessage .`` The result of the action on each  mes-
       sage is reported individually in the response.

       WARNING:
          Because  the batch request can result in a combination of successful
          and unsuccessful actions, you should check  for  batch  errors  even
          when the call returns an HTTP status code of 200 .

       Some  actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using
       the param.n notation. Values of n are integers starting from 1. For ex-
       ample, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:
          &AttributeName.1=first

          &AttributeName.2=second

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-message-batch
          --queue-url <value>
          --entries <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are deleted.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --entries (list)
          A list of receipt handles for the messages to be deleted.

          (structure)
              Encloses a receipt handle and an identifier for it.

              Id -> (string)
                 An  identifier  for  this  particular receipt handle. This is
                 used to communicate the result.

                 NOTE:
                     The Id s of a batch request need to be  unique  within  a
                     request.

                     This identifier can have up to 80 characters. The follow-
                     ing characters are accepted: alphanumeric characters, hy-
                     phens(-), and underscores (_).

              ReceiptHandle -> (string)
                 A receipt handle.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,ReceiptHandle=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Id": "string",
              "ReceiptHandle": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
