LIST-QUEUES()                                                    LIST-QUEUES()



NAME
       list-queues -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of your queues in the current region. The response in-
       cludes a maximum of 1,000 results. If you specify a value for  the  op-
       tional  QueueNamePrefix  parameter, only queues with a name that begins
       with the specified value are returned.

       The listQueues methods supports pagination. Set parameter MaxResults in
       the  request to specify the maximum number of results to be returned in
       the response. If you do not set MaxResults , the  response  includes  a
       maximum  of  1,000  results.  If you set MaxResults and there are addi-
       tional results to display, the response includes a value for  NextToken
       .  Use  NextToken  as a parameter in your next request to listQueues to
       receive the next page of results.

       list-queues is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: QueueUrls

SYNOPSIS
            list-queues
          [--queue-name-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-name-prefix (string)
          A  string  to  use for filtering the list results. Only those queues
          whose name begins with the specified string are returned.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list queues

       This example lists all queues.

       Command:

          aws sqs list-queues

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrls": [
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyDeadLetterQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyOtherQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/TestQueue1",
                  "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/TestQueue2"
            ]
          }

       This example lists only queues that start with "My".

       Command:

          aws sqs list-queues --queue-name-prefix My

       Output:

          {
            "QueueUrls": [
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyDeadLetterQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyQueue",
              "https://queue.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyOtherQueue"
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       QueueUrls -> (list)
          A list of queue URLs, up to 1,000 entries, or the  value  of  MaxRe-
          sults that you sent in the request.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          Pagination token to include in the next request. Token value is null
          if there are no additional results to request, or if you did not set
          MaxResults in the request.
