RECEIVE-MESSAGE()                                            RECEIVE-MESSAGE()



NAME
       receive-message -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  one  or  more messages (up to 10), from the specified queue.
       Using the WaitTimeSeconds parameter enables long-poll support. For more
       information,  see  Amazon  SQS Long Polling in the Amazon SQS Developer
       Guide .

       Short poll is the default behavior where a weighted random set  of  ma-
       chines  is sampled on a ReceiveMessage call. Thus, only the messages on
       the sampled machines are returned. If the number  of  messages  in  the
       queue  is  small (fewer than 1,000), you most likely get fewer messages
       than you requested per ReceiveMessage call. If the number  of  messages
       in  the queue is extremely small, you might not receive any messages in
       a particular ReceiveMessage response. If this happens, repeat  the  re-
       quest.

       For each message returned, the response includes the following:

       o The message body.

       o An  MD5  digest  of  the message body. For information about MD5, see
         RFC1321 .

       o The MessageId you received when you sent the message to the queue.

       o The receipt handle.

       o The message attributes.

       o An MD5 digest of the message attributes.

       The receipt handle is the identifier you must provide when deleting the
       message. For more information, see Queue and Message Identifiers in the
       Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       You can provide the VisibilityTimeout parameter in  your  request.  The
       parameter is applied to the messages that Amazon SQS returns in the re-
       sponse. If you don't include  the  parameter,  the  overall  visibility
       timeout  for  the queue is used for the returned messages. For more in-
       formation, see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       A message that isn't deleted or a message whose  visibility  isn't  ex-
       tended  before  the  visibility  timeout expires counts as a failed re-
       ceive. Depending on the configuration of the queue, the  message  might
       be sent to the dead-letter queue.

       NOTE:
          In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write code that
          calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code so that
          it can handle new attributes gracefully.

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue from which messages are received.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attribute-names (list)
          A  list  of attributes that need to be returned along with each mes-
          sage. These attributes include:

          o All  Returns all values.

          o ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp  Returns the time the message was
            first received from the queue (epoch time in milliseconds).

          o ApproximateReceiveCount  Returns the number of times a message has
            been received across all queues but not deleted.

          o AWSTraceHeader  Returns the X-Ray trace header string.

          o SenderId

            o For  a  user,  returns  the  user   ID,   for   example   ABCDE-
              FGHI1JKLMNOPQ23R .

            o For   an  IAM  role,  returns  the  IAM  role  ID,  for  example
              ABCDE1F2GH3I4JK5LMNOP:i-a123b456 .

          o SentTimestamp  Returns the time the message was sent to the  queue
            (epoch time in milliseconds).

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled   Enables  server-side queue encryption using
            SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption  option
            is supported per queue (for example, SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          o MessageDeduplicationId  Returns the value provided by the producer
            that calls the ``  SendMessage `` action.

          o MessageGroupId  Returns the value provided by  the  producer  that
            calls  the  ``  SendMessage `` action. Messages with the same Mes-
            sageGroupId are returned in sequence.

          o SequenceNumber  Returns the value provided by Amazon SQS.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            All
            Policy
            VisibilityTimeout
            MaximumMessageSize
            MessageRetentionPeriod
            ApproximateNumberOfMessages
            ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible
            CreatedTimestamp
            LastModifiedTimestamp
            QueueArn
            ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed
            DelaySeconds
            ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds
            RedrivePolicy
            FifoQueue
            ContentBasedDeduplication
            KmsMasterKeyId
            KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds
            DeduplicationScope
            FifoThroughputLimit
            RedriveAllowPolicy
            SqsManagedSseEnabled

       --message-attribute-names (list)
          The name of the message attribute, where N is the index.

          o The name can contain alphanumeric characters and the underscore (_
            ), hyphen (- ), and period (. ).

          o The  name is case-sensitive and must be unique among all attribute
            names for the message.

          o The name must not start with AWS-reserved prefixes such as AWS. or
            Amazon. (or any casing variants).

          o The  name  must not start or end with a period (. ), and it should
            not have periods in succession (.. ).

          o The name can be up to 256 characters long.

          When using ReceiveMessage , you can send a list of  attribute  names
          to  receive,  or  you can return all of the attributes by specifying
          All or .* in your request. You can also use all  message  attributes
          starting with a prefix, for example bar.* .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --max-number-of-messages (integer)
          The  maximum  number of messages to return. Amazon SQS never returns
          more messages than this value (however, fewer messages might be  re-
          turned). Valid values: 1 to 10. Default: 1.

       --visibility-timeout (integer)
          The duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from
          subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a  ReceiveMes-
          sage request.

       --wait-time-seconds (integer)
          The  duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to
          arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the
          call returns sooner than WaitTimeSeconds . If no messages are avail-
          able and the wait time expires, the call returns  successfully  with
          an empty list of messages.

          WARNING:
              To  avoid HTTP errors, ensure that the HTTP response timeout for
              ReceiveMessage requests is longer than the  WaitTimeSeconds  pa-
              rameter. For example, with the Java SDK, you can set HTTP trans-
              port settings using the NettyNioAsyncHttpClient for asynchronous
              clients, or the ApacheHttpClient for synchronous clients.

       --receive-request-attempt-id (string)
          This parameter applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out) queues.

          The  token used for deduplication of ReceiveMessage calls. If a net-
          working issue occurs after a ReceiveMessage action, and instead of a
          response  you  receive  a generic error, it is possible to retry the
          same action with an identical  ReceiveRequestAttemptId  to  retrieve
          the  same  set of messages, even if their visibility timeout has not
          yet expired.

          o You can use ReceiveRequestAttemptId only for 5 minutes after a Re-
            ceiveMessage action.

          o When you set FifoQueue , a caller of the ReceiveMessage action can
            provide a ReceiveRequestAttemptId explicitly.

          o If a caller of the ReceiveMessage action  doesn't  provide  a  Re-
            ceiveRequestAttemptId  ,  Amazon SQS generates a ReceiveRequestAt-
            temptId .

          o It is possible to retry the ReceiveMessage action  with  the  same
            ReceiveRequestAttemptId if none of the messages have been modified
            (deleted or had their visibility changes).

          o During a visibility timeout, subsequent calls with  the  same  Re-
            ceiveRequestAttemptId  return  the  same messages and receipt han-
            dles. If a retry occurs within the deduplication interval, it  re-
            sets  the visibility timeout. For more information, see Visibility
            Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          WARNING:
              If a caller of the ReceiveMessage action  still  processes  mes-
              sages  when  the  visibility timeout expires and messages become
              visible, another worker consuming from the same  queue  can  re-
              ceive  the same messages and therefore process duplicates. Also,
              if a consumer whose message processing time is longer  than  the
              visibility  timeout  tries to delete the processed messages, the
              action fails with an error. To mitigate this effect, ensure that
              your application observes a safe threshold before the visibility
              timeout expires and extend the visibility timeout as necessary.

          o While messages with a particular MessageGroupId are invisible,  no
            more  messages  belonging  to the same MessageGroupId are returned
            until the visibility timeout expires. You can still  receive  mes-
            sages with another MessageGroupId as long as it is also visible.

          o If  a  caller  of ReceiveMessage can't track the ReceiveRequestAt-
            temptId , no retries work until the  original  visibility  timeout
            expires.  As  a result, delays might occur but the messages in the
            queue remain in a strict order.

          The maximum length of ReceiveRequestAttemptId is 128 characters. Re-
          ceiveRequestAttemptId can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z
          , 0-9 ) and punctuation (!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~ ).

          For best practices of using ReceiveRequestAttemptId , see Using  the
          ReceiveRequestAttemptId  Request  Parameter in the Amazon SQS Devel-
          oper Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To receive a message

       This example receives up to 10 available messages, returning all avail-
       able attributes.

OUTPUT
       Messages -> (list)
          A list of messages.

          (structure)
              An Amazon SQS message.

              MessageId -> (string)
                 A  unique  identifier for the message. A MessageId is consid-
                 ered unique across all Amazon Web Services  accounts  for  an
                 extended period of time.

              ReceiptHandle -> (string)
                 An  identifier  associated with the act of receiving the mes-
                 sage. A new receipt handle is returned every time you receive
                 a  message. When deleting a message, you provide the last re-
                 ceived receipt handle to delete the message.

              MD5OfBody -> (string)
                 An MD5 digest of the non-URL-encoded message body string.

              Body -> (string)
                 The message's contents (not URL-encoded).

              Attributes -> (map)
                 A map of the attributes requested in ``  ReceiveMessage `` to
                 their respective values. Supported attributes:

                 o ApproximateReceiveCount

                 o ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp

                 o MessageDeduplicationId

                 o MessageGroupId

                 o SenderId

                 o SentTimestamp

                 o SequenceNumber
                     ApproximateFirstReceiveTimestamp  and  SentTimestamp  are
                     each returned as an integer representing the  epoch  time
                     in milliseconds.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              MD5OfMessageAttributes -> (string)
                 An  MD5  digest  of  the  non-URL-encoded  message  attribute
                 string. You can use this attribute to verify that Amazon  SQS
                 received  the  message  correctly. Amazon SQS URL-decodes the
                 message before creating the MD5 digest. For information about
                 MD5, see RFC1321 .

              MessageAttributes -> (map)
                 Each  message attribute consists of a Name , Type , and Value
                 . For more information, see Amazon SQS message attributes  in

                 value -> (structure)
                     The  user-specified  message  attribute value. For string
                     data types, the Value attribute has the same restrictions
                     on the content as the message body. For more information,
