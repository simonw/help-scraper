SET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()                                  SET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       set-queue-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the  value  of  one  or  more queue attributes. When you change a
       queue's attributes, the change can take up to 60 seconds  for  most  of
       the  attributes  to propagate throughout the Amazon SQS system. Changes
       made to the MessageRetentionPeriod attribute can take up to 15 minutes.

       NOTE:

          o In the future, new attributes might be added. If  you  write  code
            that  calls this action, we recommend that you structure your code
            so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

          o Cross-account permissions don't apply to this action. For more in-
            formation,  see  Grant  cross-account  permissions to a role and a
            user name in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          o To remove the ability to change queue permissions, you  must  deny
            permission   to   the   AddPermission  ,  RemovePermission  ,  and
            SetQueueAttributes actions in your IAM policy.

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attributes are set.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attributes (map)
          A map of attributes to set.

          The following lists the names, descriptions, and values of the  spe-
          cial request parameters that the SetQueueAttributes action uses:

          o DelaySeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for which the deliv-
            ery of all messages in the queue is delayed. Valid values: An  in-
            teger from 0 to 900 (15 minutes). Default: 0.

          o MaximumMessageSize  The limit of how many bytes a message can con-
            tain before Amazon SQS rejects it. Valid values: An  integer  from
            1,024  bytes  (1  KiB)  up  to  262,144  bytes (256 KiB). Default:
            262,144 (256 KiB).

          o MessageRetentionPeriod  The length of time, in seconds, for  which
            Amazon  SQS retains a message. Valid values: An integer represent-
            ing seconds, from 60 (1 minute) to 1,209,600 (14  days).  Default:
            345,600 (4 days).

          o Policy   The  queue's  policy. A valid Amazon Web Services policy.
            For more information about policy structure, see Overview of  Ama-
            zon  Web  Services IAM Policies in the Identity and Access Manage-
            ment User Guide .

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  The length of time, in seconds, for
            which  a  ``   ReceiveMessage `` action waits for a message to ar-
            rive. Valid values: An integer from 0 to 20 (seconds). Default: 0.

          o RedrivePolicy  The string that includes  the  parameters  for  the
            dead-letter  queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON ob-
            ject. For more information about the redrive policy and  dead-let-
            ter  queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the Amazon
            SQS Developer Guide .

            o deadLetterTargetArn  The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the
              dead-letter  queue  to which Amazon SQS moves messages after the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount  The number of times a message is  delivered  to
              the  source  queue  before being moved to the dead-letter queue.
              When the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the  maxReceiveCount
              for  a  queue,  Amazon  SQS  moves  the message to the dead-let-
              ter-queue.

          NOTE:
              The dead-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue.
              Similarly,  the  dead-letter queue of a standard queue must also
              be a standard queue.

          o VisibilityTimeout  The visibility timeout for the queue,  in  sec-
            onds.  Valid  values:  An integer from 0 to 43,200 (12 hours). De-
            fault: 30. For more information about the visibility timeout,  see
            Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   The ID of an Amazon Web Services managed customer
            master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more informa-
            tion,  see  Key Terms . While the alias of the AWS-managed CMK for
            Amazon SQS is always alias/aws/sqs , the alias  of  a  custom  CMK
            can, for example, be
            ``
            alias/MyAlias `` . For more examples, see KeyId in the Key Manage-
            ment Service API Reference .

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 137)
            Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds  The length of time, in seconds,  for
            which  Amazon  SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or decrypt mes-
            sages before calling KMS again. An integer  representing  seconds,
            between  60  seconds (1 minute) and 86,400 seconds (24 hours). De-
            fault: 300 (5 minutes). A shorter time period provides better  se-
            curity  but results in more calls to KMS which might incur charges
            after Free Tier. For more information, see How Does the  Data  Key
            Reuse Period Work? .

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled   Enables  server-side queue encryption using
            SQS owned encryption keys. Only one server-side encryption  option
            is supported per queue (e.g. SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The  following  attribute  applies only to FIFO (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o ContentBasedDeduplication   Enables  content-based  deduplication.
            For  more  information,  see Exactly-once processing in the Amazon
            SQS Developer Guide . Note the following:

            o Every message must have a unique MessageDeduplicationId .

              o You may provide a MessageDeduplicationId explicitly.

              o If you aren't able to provide a MessageDeduplicationId and you
                enable  ContentBasedDeduplication  for  your queue, Amazon SQS
                uses a SHA-256 hash to generate the MessageDeduplicationId us-
                ing  the  body  of  the message (but not the attributes of the
                message).

              o If you don't provide a MessageDeduplicationId  and  the  queue
                doesn't  have  ContentBasedDeduplication set, the action fails
                with an error.

              o If the queue has ContentBasedDeduplication set, your MessageD-
                eduplicationId overrides the generated one.

            o When ContentBasedDeduplication is in effect, messages with iden-
              tical content sent within the deduplication interval are treated
              as duplicates and only one copy of the message is delivered.

            o If  you  send one message with ContentBasedDeduplication enabled
              and then another message with a MessageDeduplicationId  that  is
              the  same  as  the one generated for the first MessageDeduplica-
              tionId , the two messages are treated as duplicates and only one
              copy of the message is delivered.

          The  following  attributes  apply  only  to high throughput for FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit  Specifies whether the FIFO  queue  throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues are perQueue and  perMessageGroupId  .  The  perMessageGroupId
            value  is  allowed  only  when the value for DeduplicationScope is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If you set these attributes to anything other than the values  shown
          for  enabling  high  throughput,  normal throughput is in effect and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To set queue attributes

       This  example  sets  the specified queue to a delivery delay of 10 sec-
       onds, a maximum message size of 128 KB (128 KB * 1,024 bytes),  a  mes-
       sage  retention  period  of 3 days (3 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60
       seconds), a receive message wait time of 20 seconds, and a default vis-
       ibility  timeout of 60 seconds. This example also associates the speci-
       fied dead letter queue with a maximum receive count of 1,000 messages.

       Command:

          aws sqs set-queue-attributes --queue-url https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/80398EXAMPLE/MyNewQueue --attributes file://set-queue-attributes.json

       Input file (set-queue-attributes.json):

          {
            "DelaySeconds": "10",
            "MaximumMessageSize": "131072",
            "MessageRetentionPeriod": "259200",
            "ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds": "20",
            "RedrivePolicy": "{\"deadLetterTargetArn\":\"arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:80398EXAMPLE:MyDeadLetterQueue\",\"maxReceiveCount\":\"1000\"}",
            "VisibilityTimeout": "60"
          }

       Output:

          None.

OUTPUT
       None
