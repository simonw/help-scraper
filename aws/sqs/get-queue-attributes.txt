GET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()                                  GET-QUEUE-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-queue-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets attributes for the specified queue.

       NOTE:
          To  determine whether a queue is FIFO , you can check whether Queue-
          Name ends with the .fifo suffix.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-queue-attributes
          --queue-url <value>
          [--attribute-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --queue-url (string)
          The URL of the Amazon SQS queue whose attribute information  is  re-
          trieved.

          Queue URLs and names are case-sensitive.

       --attribute-names (list)
          A list of attributes for which to retrieve information.

          The  AttributeName.N parameter is optional, but if you don't specify
          values for this parameter, the request returns empty results.

          NOTE:
              In the future, new attributes might be added. If you write  code
              that  calls  this  action,  we recommend that you structure your
              code so that it can handle new attributes gracefully.

          The following attributes are supported:

          WARNING:
              The ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed , ApproximateNumberOfMes-
              sagesNotVisible , and ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible metrics
              may not achieve consistency until at least 1  minute  after  the
              producers stop sending messages. This period is required for the
              queue metadata to reach eventual consistency.

          o All  Returns all values.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessages  Returns  the  approximate  number  of
            messages available for retrieval from the queue.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessagesDelayed  Returns the approximate number
            of messages in the queue that are delayed and  not  available  for
            reading  immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured
            as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay  pa-
            rameter.

          o ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible    Returns  the  approximate
            number of messages that are in flight. Messages are considered  to
            be  in  flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet
            been deleted or have not yet reached the end of  their  visibility
            window.

          o CreatedTimestamp   Returns  the time when the queue was created in
            seconds (epoch time ).

          o DelaySeconds  Returns the default delay on the queue in seconds.

          o LastModifiedTimestamp  Returns the time when the  queue  was  last
            changed in seconds (epoch time ).

          o MaximumMessageSize   Returns the limit of how many bytes a message
            can contain before Amazon SQS rejects it.

          o MessageRetentionPeriod  Returns the length of  time,  in  seconds,
            for which Amazon SQS retains a message.

          o Policy  Returns the policy of the queue.

          o QueueArn  Returns the Amazon resource name (ARN) of the queue.

          o ReceiveMessageWaitTimeSeconds  Returns the length of time, in sec-
            onds, for which the ReceiveMessage action waits for a  message  to
            arrive.

          o RedrivePolicy   The  string  that  includes the parameters for the
            dead-letter queue functionality of the source queue as a JSON  ob-
            ject.  For more information about the redrive policy and dead-let-
            ter queues, see Using Amazon SQS Dead-Letter Queues in the  Amazon
            SQS Developer Guide .

            o deadLetterTargetArn   The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the
              dead-letter queue to which Amazon SQS moves messages  after  the
              value of maxReceiveCount is exceeded.

            o maxReceiveCount   The  number of times a message is delivered to
              the source queue before being moved to  the  dead-letter  queue.
              When  the ReceiveCount for a message exceeds the maxReceiveCount
              for a queue, Amazon SQS  moves  the  message  to  the  dead-let-
              ter-queue.

          o VisibilityTimeout   Returns  the visibility timeout for the queue.
            For more information about the visibility timeout, see  Visibility
            Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The following attributes apply only to server-side-encryption :

          o KmsMasterKeyId   Returns  the ID of an Amazon Web Services managed
            customer master key (CMK) for Amazon SQS or a custom CMK. For more
            information, see Key Terms .

          o KmsDataKeyReusePeriodSeconds   Returns the length of time, in sec-
            onds, for which Amazon SQS can reuse a data key to encrypt or  de-
            crypt messages before calling KMS again. For more information, see
            How Does the Data Key Reuse Period Work? .

          o SqsManagedSseEnabled  Returns information about whether the  queue
            is  using SSE-SQS encryption using SQS owned encryption keys. Only
            one server-side encryption option is  supported  per  queue  (e.g.
            SSE-KMS or SSE-SQS ).

          The  following  attributes  apply  only to FIFO (first-in-first-out)
          queues :

          o FifoQueue  Returns information about whether the  queue  is  FIFO.
            For  more  information, see FIFO queue logic in the Amazon SQS De-
            veloper Guide .

          NOTE:
              To determine whether a queue is FIFO ,  you  can  check  whether
              QueueName ends with the .fifo suffix.

          o ContentBasedDeduplication   Returns whether content-based dedupli-
            cation is  enabled  for  the  queue.  For  more  information,  see
            Exactly-once processing in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          The  following  attributes  apply  only  to high throughput for FIFO
          queues :

          o DeduplicationScope  Specifies whether message deduplication occurs
            at the message group or queue level. Valid values are messageGroup
            and queue .

          o FifoThroughputLimit  Specifies whether the FIFO  queue  throughput
            quota applies to the entire queue or per message group. Valid val-
            ues are perQueue and  perMessageGroupId  .  The  perMessageGroupId
            value  is  allowed  only  when the value for DeduplicationScope is
            messageGroup .

          To enable high throughput for FIFO queues, do the following:

          o Set DeduplicationScope to messageGroup .

          o Set FifoThroughputLimit to perMessageGroupId .

          If you set these attributes to anything other than the values  shown
          for  enabling  high  throughput,  normal throughput is in effect and
          deduplication occurs as specified.

          For information on throughput quotas, see Quotas related to messages
          in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          Where valid values are:

            MaximumMessageSize

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
