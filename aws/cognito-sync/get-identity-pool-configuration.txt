OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
          Cognito. This is the ID of the pool for which to return a configura-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
          Cognito.

       PushSync -> (structure)
          Options to apply to this identity pool for push synchronization.

          ApplicationArns -> (list)
              List of SNS platform application ARNs  that  could  be  used  by
              clients.

              (string)

          RoleArn -> (string)
              A  role configured to allow Cognito to call SNS on behalf of the
              developer.

       CognitoStreams -> (structure)
          Options to apply to this identity pool for Amazon Cognito streams.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the Cognito stream to receive updates.  This  stream
              must  be in the developers account and in the same region as the
              identity pool.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role Amazon Cognito can assume in order  to  pub-
              lish  to  the stream. This role must grant access to Amazon Cog-
              nito (cognito-sync) to invoke PutRecord on your Cognito stream.

          StreamingStatus -> (string)
              Status of the Cognito streams. Valid values are:

              ENABLED - Streaming of updates to identity pool is enabled.

              DISABLED - Streaming of updates to identity  pool  is  disabled.
              Bulk publish will also fail if StreamingStatus is DISABLED.
