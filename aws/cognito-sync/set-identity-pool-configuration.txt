SYNOPSIS
            set-identity-pool-configuration
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--push-sync <value>]
          [--cognito-streams <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
          Cognito. This is the ID of the pool to modify.

       --push-sync (structure)
          Options to apply to this identity pool for push synchronization.

          ApplicationArns -> (list)
              List  of  SNS  platform  application  ARNs that could be used by
              clients.

              (string)

          RoleArn -> (string)
              A role configured to allow Cognito to call SNS on behalf of  the
              developer.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ApplicationArns=string,string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ApplicationArns": ["string", ...],
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --cognito-streams  (structure)  Options  to apply to this identity pool
       for Amazon Cognito streams.StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the Cognito stream to receive updates.  This  stream
              must  be in the developers account and in the same region as the
              identity pool.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role Amazon Cognito can assume in order  to  pub-
              lish  to  the stream. This role must grant access to Amazon Cog-
              nito (cognito-sync) to invoke PutRecord on your Cognito stream.

          StreamingStatus -> (string)
              Status of the Cognito streams. Valid values are:

              ENABLED - Streaming of updates to identity pool is enabled.

              DISABLED - Streaming of updates to identity  pool  is  disabled.
              Bulk publish will also fail if StreamingStatus is DISABLED.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          StreamName=string,RoleArn=string,StreamingStatus=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "StreamName": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string",
            "StreamingStatus": "ENABLED"|"DISABLED"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
          Cognito.

       PushSync -> (structure)
          Options to apply to this identity pool for push synchronization.

          ApplicationArns -> (list)
              List of SNS platform application ARNs  that  could  be  used  by
              clients.

              (string)

          RoleArn -> (string)

              developer.

       CognitoStreams -> (structure)
          Options to apply to this identity pool for Amazon Cognito streams.

          StreamName -> (string)
              The name of the Cognito stream to receive updates.  This  stream
              must  be in the developers account and in the same region as the
              identity pool.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role Amazon Cognito can assume in order  to  pub-
              lish  to  the stream. This role must grant access to Amazon Cog-
              nito (cognito-sync) to invoke PutRecord on your Cognito stream.

          StreamingStatus -> (string)
              Status of the Cognito streams. Valid values are:

              ENABLED - Streaming of updates to identity pool is enabled.

              DISABLED - Streaming of updates to identity  pool  is  disabled.
              Bulk publish will also fail if StreamingStatus is DISABLED.
