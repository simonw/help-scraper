DESCRIPTION

       tity.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-bulk-publish-details
          --identity-pool-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identity-pool-id   (string)   A   name-spaced   GUID   (for  example,
       us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE) created by Amazon  Cog-
       nito. GUID generation is unique within a region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       IdentityPoolId -> (string)
          A          name-spaced          GUID          (for          example,
          us-east-1:23EC4050-6AEA-7089-A2DD-08002EXAMPLE)  created  by  Amazon
