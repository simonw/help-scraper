NAME
       get-identity-mail-from-domain-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the custom MAIL FROM attributes for a list of identities (email
       addresses : domains).

       This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only  get
       custom MAIL FROM attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-identity-mail-from-domain-attributes
          --identities <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identities (list)
          A list of one or more identities.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MailFromDomainAttributes -> (map)
          A map of identities to custom MAIL FROM attributes.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              Represents the custom MAIL FROM domain attributes of a  verified
              identity (email address or domain).

              MailFromDomain -> (string)
                 The  custom  MAIL FROM domain that the identity is configured
                 to use.

              MailFromDomainStatus -> (string)
                 The state that indicates whether Amazon SES has  successfully
                 read  the  MX  record  required  for  custom MAIL FROM domain
                 setup. If the state is Success , Amazon SES uses  the  speci-
                 fied custom MAIL FROM domain when the verified identity sends
                 an email. All other states indicate that Amazon SES takes the
                 action described by BehaviorOnMXFailure .

              BehaviorOnMXFailure -> (string)
                 The  action  that  Amazon SES takes if it cannot successfully
                 read the required MX record when you send an email.  A  value
                 of  UseDefaultValue  indicates that if Amazon SES cannot read
                 the required MX record, it uses amazonses.com (or a subdomain
                 of  that)  as  the MAIL FROM domain. A value of RejectMessage
                 indicates that if Amazon SES  cannot  read  the  required  MX
                 record,  Amazon SES returns a MailFromDomainNotVerified error
                 and does not send the email.

                 The custom MAIL FROM setup states that result in this  behav-
                 ior are Pending , Failed , and TemporaryFailure .
