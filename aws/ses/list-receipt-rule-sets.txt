LIST-RECEIPT-RULE-SETS()                              LIST-RECEIPT-RULE-SETS()



NAME
       list-receipt-rule-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  receipt  rule sets that exist under your AWS account in the
       current AWS Region. If there are additional receipt rule sets to be re-
       trieved,  you will receive a NextToken that you can provide to the next
       call to ListReceiptRuleSets to retrieve the additional entries.

       For information about managing receipt rule sets, see  the  Amazon  SES
       Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-receipt-rule-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: RuleSets

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RuleSets -> (list)
          The metadata for the currently active receipt rule set. The metadata
          consists of the rule set name and the timestamp of when the rule set
          was created.

          (structure)
              Information about a receipt rule set.

              A  receipt  rule  set is a collection of rules that specify what
              Amazon SES should do with mail it receives on behalf of your ac-
              count's verified domains.

              For  information  about  setting  up  receipt rule sets, see the
              Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the receipt rule set. The name must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Start and end with a letter or number.

                 o Contain less than 64 characters.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the receipt rule set was created.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  token  indicating  that  there  are  additional receipt rule sets
          available to be listed. Pass  this  token  to  successive  calls  of
          ListReceiptRuleSets  to  retrieve  up  to 100 receipt rule sets at a
          time.
