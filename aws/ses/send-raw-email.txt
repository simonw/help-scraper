SEND-RAW-EMAIL()                                              SEND-RAW-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-raw-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.

       This  operation is more flexible than the SendEmail API operation. When
       you use the SendRawEmail operation, you can specify the headers of  the
       message  as  well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for exam-
       ple, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message  that
       contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this opera-
       tion to send messages that include attachments.

       The SendRawEmail operation has the following requirements:

       o You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains . If
         you try to send email from an address that isn't verified, the opera-
         tion results in an "Email address not verified" error.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox  ,  you  can  only
         send  email  to  other  verified addresses in your account, or to ad-
         dresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator .

       o The maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.

       o Each message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipi-
         ent address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.

       o If  you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and
         one of the recipient addresses isn't in a valid format (that is, it's
         not  in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ), Ama-
         zon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other  addresses  are
         valid.

       o Each message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:,
         CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than
         50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into
         groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each
         group.

       o Amazon  SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for
         MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents
         of  your  message  (for example, if you use open and click tracking),
         8-bit content isn't preserved. For this reason, we  highly  recommend
         that you encode all content that isn't 7-bit ASCII. For more informa-
         tion, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       Additionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using  the
       SendRawEmail operation:

       o Although  you  can  customize  the  message  headers  when  using the
         SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply  its  own
         Message-ID  and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creat-
         ing the message, they will be overwritten by the values  that  Amazon
         SES provides.

       o If  you  are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another
         user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account  identity
         for  the  email's  Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of
         two ways: you can pass optional  parameters  SourceArn  ,  FromArn  ,
         and/or  ReturnPathArn  to  the  API, or you can include the following
         X-headers in the header of your raw email:

         o X-SES-SOURCE-ARN

         o X-SES-FROM-ARN

         o X-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN

       WARNING:
          Don't include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES  re-
          moves these before it sends the email.

       If  you  only  specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets
       the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you speci-
       fied.

       For more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending
       Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

       o For every message that you send, the total number of recipients  (in-
         cluding  each  recipient  in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
         against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period
         (your  sending  quota ). For more information about sending quotas in
         Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon
         SES Developer Guide.

OPTIONS
       --source (string)
          The identity's email address. If you do not provide a value for this
          parameter, you must specify a "From" address in the raw text of  the
          message. (You can also specify both.)

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in`RFC6531 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6531>`__ .  For  this
              reason,  the  local  part of a source email address (the part of
              the email address that precedes the @  sign)  may  only  contain
              7-bit  ASCII  characters . If the domain part of an address (the
              part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they  must
              be  encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492 . The sender
              name (also known as the friendly name )  may  contain  non-ASCII
              characters.  These  characters  must  be  encoded using MIME en-
              coded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 . MIME  encoded-word
              syntax   uses   the   following   form:   =?charset?encoding?en-
              coded-text?= .

          If you specify the Source parameter and have feedback forwarding en-
          abled,  then  bounces  and complaints will be sent to this email ad-
          dress. This takes precedence over any Return-Path  header  that  you
          might include in the raw text of the message.

       --destinations (list)
          A  list of destinations for the message, consisting of To:, CC:, and
          BCC: addresses.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --raw-message (structure)
          The raw email message itself. The message has to meet the  following
          criteria:

          o The  message  has  to  contain a header and a body, separated by a
            blank line.

          o All of the required header fields must be present in the message.

          o Each part of a multipart MIME message must be formatted properly.

          o Attachments must be of a content type that  Amazon  SES  supports.
            For  a  list on unsupported content types, see Unsupported Attach-
            ment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          o The entire message must be base64-encoded.

          o If any of the MIME parts in your message contain content  that  is
            outside  of  the  7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend
            that you encode that content. For more  information,  see  Sending
            Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          o Per  RFC 5321 , the maximum length of each line of text, including
            the <CRLF>, must not exceed 1,000 characters.

          Data -> (blob)
              The raw data of the message. This data needs  to  base64-encoded
              if  you  are accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS in-
              terface. If you are accessing Amazon SES using an AWS  SDK,  the
              SDK  takes  care  of the base 64-encoding for you. In all cases,
              the client must ensure that the message format complies with In-
              ternet  email  standards  regarding  email  header  fields, MIME
              types, and MIME encoding.

              The To:, CC:, and BCC: headers in the raw message can contain  a
              group list.

              If  you  are  using SendRawEmail with sending authorization, you
              can  include  X-headers  in  the  raw  message  to  specify  the
              "Source," "From," and "Return-Path" addresses. For more informa-
              tion, see the documentation for SendRawEmail .

              WARNING:
                 Do not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature, because
                 they are removed by Amazon SES before sending the email.

              For more information, go to the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Data=blob

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Data": blob
          }

       --from-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to specify a particular "From" address in
          the header of the raw email.

          Instead  of  using  this  parameter,  you  can  use   the   X-header
          X-SES-FROM-ARN  in the raw message of the email. If you use both the
          FromArn parameter and the corresponding X-header,  Amazon  SES  uses
          the value of the FromArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For  information  about  when to use this parameter, see the de-
              scription of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the  Amazon  SES
              Developer Guide .

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits you to send for the email address specified in
          the Source parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to  send  from  user@example.com  ,
          then     you     would     specify     the     SourceArn    to    be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          Instead   of   using  this  parameter,  you  can  use  the  X-header
          X-SES-SOURCE-ARN in the raw message of the email. If  you  use  both
          the  SourceArn  parameter and the corresponding X-header, Amazon SES
          uses the value of the SourceArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For information about when to use this parameter,  see  the  de-
              scription  of  SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the Amazon SES
              Developer Guide .

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to use the email address  specified  in  the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com , then
          you     would     specify     the      ReturnPathArn      to      be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          Instead of using this parameter, you can use the X-header  X-SES-RE-
          TURN-PATH-ARN  in  the raw message of the email. If you use both the
          ReturnPathArn parameter and the corresponding X-header,  Amazon  SES
          uses the value of the ReturnPathArn parameter.

          NOTE:
              For  information  about  when to use this parameter, see the de-
              scription of SendRawEmail in this guide, or see the  Amazon  SES
              Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags,  in  the form of name/value pairs, to apply to an
          email that you send using SendRawEmail . Tags correspond to  charac-
          teristics  of  the  email  that  you define, so that you can publish
          email sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains the name and value of a tag that  you  can  provide  to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message  tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable you
              to publish email sending events.  For  information  about  using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. The name must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. The value must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The  name of the configuration set to use when you send an email us-
          ing SendRawEmail .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To send a raw email using Amazon SES

       The following example uses the send-raw-email command to send an  email
       with a TXT attachment:

          aws ses send-raw-email --raw-message file://message.json

       Output:

          {
             "MessageId": "EXAMPLEf3f73d99b-c63fb06f-d263-41f8-a0fb-d0dc67d56c07-000000"
          }

       The  raw  message  is  a JSON data structure saved in a file named mes-
       sage.json in the current directory. It contains the following:

          {
             "Data": "From: sender@example.com\nTo: recipient@example.com\nSubject: Test email sent using the AWS CLI (contains an attachment)\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-type: Multipart/Mixed; boundary=\"NextPart\"\n\n--NextPart\nContent-Type: text/plain\n\nThis is the message body.\n\n--NextPart\nContent-Type: text/plain;\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"attachment.txt\"\n\nThis is the text in the attachment.\n\n--NextPart--"
          }

       As you can see, "Data" is one long string that contains the entire  raw
       email  content  in  MIME format, including an attachment called attach-
       ment.txt.

       Replace sender@example.com and recipient@example.com with the addresses
       you  want to use. Note that the sender's email address must be verified
       with Amazon SES. Until you are granted production access to Amazon SES,
       you  must also verify the email address of the recipient unless the re-
       cipient is the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. For  more  information  on
       verification,  see  Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in Amazon SES
       in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

       The Message ID in the output indicates that the call to  send-raw-email
       was successful.

       If you don't receive the email, check your Junk box.

       For  more information on sending raw email, see Sending Raw Email Using
       the Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The unique message identifier returned from the SendRawEmail action.
