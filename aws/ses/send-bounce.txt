DESCRIPTION
       Generates  and sends a bounce message to the sender of an email you re-
       ceived through Amazon SES. You can only use this API on an email up  to
       24 hours after you receive it.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  use  this API to send generic bounces for mail that was
          not received by Amazon SES.

       For information about receiving  email  through  Amazon  SES,  see  the
       Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

            "ReportingMta": "string",
            "ArrivalDate": timestamp,
            "ExtensionFields": [
              {

                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]

          tion required to create the Delivery Status Notifications (DSNs) for
          the  recipients.  You must specify at least one BouncedRecipientInfo
          in the list.

          (structure)
              Recipient-related information to include in the Delivery  Status
              Notification  (DSN)  when  an  email that Amazon SES receives on
              your behalf bounces.

              For information about receiving email through  Amazon  SES,  see
              the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Recipient -> (string)
                 The email address of the recipient of the bounced email.

              RecipientArn -> (string)
                 This  parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is
                 the ARN of the identity that is associated with  the  sending
                 authorization  policy  that  permits you to receive email for
                 the recipient of the  bounced  email.  For  more  information
                 about  sending  authorization,  see  the Amazon SES Developer
                 Guide .

              BounceType -> (string)
                 The reason for the bounce. You must provide either  this  pa-
                 rameter or RecipientDsnFields .

              RecipientDsnFields -> (structure)
                 Recipient-related DSN fields, most of which would normally be
                 filled in automatically when provided with a BounceType . You
                 must provide either this parameter or BounceType .

                 FinalRecipient -> (string)
                     The  email address that the message was ultimately deliv-
                     ered to. This corresponds to the Final-Recipient  in  the
                     DSN.  If not specified, FinalRecipient will be set to the
                     Recipient specified in  the  BouncedRecipientInfo  struc-
                     ture.  Either  FinalRecipient or the recipient in Bounce-
                     dRecipientInfo  must  be  a  recipient  of  the  original
                     bounced message.

                     NOTE:
                        Do  not  prepend the FinalRecipient email address with
                        rfc 822; , as described in RFC 3798 .

                 Action -> (string)
                     The action performed by the reporting mail transfer agent
                     (MTA)  as  a result of its attempt to deliver the message
                     to the recipient address. This is required by RFC 3464 .

                 RemoteMta -> (string)
                     The MTA to which the remote MTA attempted to deliver  the
                     message,    formatted    as   specified   in   RFC   3464
                     (mta-name-type; mta-name ). This parameter typically  ap-
                     plies only to propagating synchronous bounces.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  status  code that indicates what went wrong. This is
                     required by RFC 3464 .

                 DiagnosticCode -> (string)
                     An extended explanation of what went wrong; this is  usu-
                     ally  an SMTP response. See RFC 3463 for the correct for-
                     matting of this parameter.

                 LastAttemptDate -> (timestamp)
                     The time the final delivery attempt was made, in RFC  822
                     date-time format.

                 ExtensionFields -> (list)
                     Additional X-headers to include in the DSN.

                     (structure)
                        Additional X-headers to include in the Delivery Status
                        Notification (DSN) when an email that Amazon  SES  re-
                        ceives on your behalf bounces.

                        For  information  about receiving email through Amazon
                        SES, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

                            The name of the header to add. Must be  between  1

              }
            }
            ...
          ]

       --bounce-sender-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits you to use the address in the "From" header of
          the bounce. For more information about  sending  authorization,  see
          the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The message ID of the bounce message.
