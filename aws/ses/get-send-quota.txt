NAME
       get-send-quota -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides the sending limits for the Amazon SES account.

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-send-quota
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get your Amazon SES sending limits

       The following example uses the get-send-quota command  to  return  your
       Amazon SES sending limits:

          aws ses get-send-quota

       Output:

          {
             "Max24HourSend": 200.0,
             "SentLast24Hours": 1.0,
             "MaxSendRate": 1.0
          }

       Max24HourSend  is  your  sending  quota, which is the maximum number of
       emails that you can send in a 24-hour period.  The  sending  quota  re-
       flects a rolling time period. Every time you try to send an email, Ama-
       zon SES checks how many emails you sent in the previous  24  hours.  As
       long as the total number of emails that you have sent is less than your
       quota, your send request will be accepted and your email will be sent.

       SentLast24Hours is the number of emails that you have sent in the  pre-
       vious 24 hours.

       MaxSendRate  is the maximum number of emails that you can send per sec-
       ond.

       Note that sending limits are based on recipients rather  than  on  mes-
       sages.  For  example,  an  email  that  has  10 recipients counts as 10
       against your sending quota.

       For more information, see Managing Your Amazon SES  Sending  Limits  in
       the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

OUTPUT
       Max24HourSend -> (double)
          The  maximum  number  of  emails  the  user  is allowed to send in a
          24-hour interval. A value of -1 signifies an unlimited quota.

       MaxSendRate -> (double)
          The maximum number of emails that Amazon SES  can  accept  from  the
          user's account per second.

          NOTE:
              The  rate  at which Amazon SES accepts the user's messages might
              be less than the maximum send rate.

       SentLast24Hours -> (double)
          The number of emails sent during the previous 24 hours.



                                                              GET-SEND-QUOTA()
