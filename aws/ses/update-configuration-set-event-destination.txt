UPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESUPDATE-CONFIGURATION-SET-EVENT-DESTINATION()



NAME
       update-configuration-set-event-destination -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the  event  destination of a configuration set. Event destina-
       tions are associated with configuration sets, which enable you to  pub-
       lish  email  sending  events to Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Kinesis Fire-
       hose, or Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS). For  informa-
       tion  about  using  configuration  sets, see Monitoring Your Amazon SES
       Sending Activity in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

       NOTE:
          When you create or update an event  destination,  you  must  provide
          one, and only one, destination. The destination can be Amazon Cloud-
          Watch, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, or Amazon Simple  Notification  Ser-
          vice (Amazon SNS).

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
