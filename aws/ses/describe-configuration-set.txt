NAME
       describe-configuration-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns the details of the specified configuration set. For information
       about using configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       You can execute this operation no more than once per second.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-configuration-set
          --configuration-set-name <value>
          [--configuration-set-attribute-names <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to describe.

       --configuration-set-attribute-names (list)
          A list of configuration set attributes to return.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            eventDestinations
            trackingOptions
            deliveryOptions
            reputationOptions

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              NOTE:
                 When you create or update an event destination, you must pro-
                 vide  one,  and only one, destination. The destination can be
                 Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon Kinesis Firehose or  Amazon  Simple
                 Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

              Event destinations are associated with configuration sets, which
              enable you to publish email sending events to Amazon CloudWatch,
              Amazon  Kinesis  Firehose, or Amazon Simple Notification Service
              (Amazon SNS). For information about  using  configuration  sets,
              see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the event destination. The name must:

                     more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the  Amazon
                     SNS Developer Guide .

       TrackingOptions -> (structure)
          The  name  of  the  custom open and click tracking domain associated
          with the configuration set.

          CustomRedirectDomain -> (string)
              The custom subdomain that will be used to redirect email recipi-
              ents to the Amazon SES event tracking domain.

       DeliveryOptions -> (structure)
          Specifies  whether  messages  that use the configuration set are re-
          quired to use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

          TlsPolicy -> (string)
              Specifies whether messages that use the  configuration  set  are
              required  to use Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the value is
              Require , messages are only delivered if a TLS connection can be
              established.  If  the value is Optional , messages can be deliv-
              ered in plain text if a TLS connection can't be established.

       ReputationOptions -> (structure)
          An object that represents the reputation settings for the configura-
          tion set.

          SendingEnabled -> (boolean)
              Describes  whether  email sending is enabled or disabled for the
              configuration set. If the value is true , then Amazon  SES  will
              send  emails  that  use  the  configuration set. If the value is
              false , Amazon SES will not send emails that use the  configura-
              tion  set.  The default value is true . You can change this set-
              ting using  UpdateConfigurationSetSendingEnabled .

          ReputationMetricsEnabled -> (boolean)
              Describes whether or not Amazon SES publishes reputation metrics
              for  the  configuration set, such as bounce and complaint rates,
              to Amazon CloudWatch.

              If the value is true , reputation metrics are published. If  the
              value  is  false , reputation metrics are not published. The de-
              fault value is false .

          LastFreshStart -> (timestamp)
              The date and time at which the reputation metrics for  the  con-
              figuration set were last reset. Resetting these metrics is known
              as a fresh start .

              When you disable email sending for  a  configuration  set  using
              UpdateConfigurationSetSendingEnabled and later re-enable it, the
              reputation metrics for the configuration set (but  not  for  the
              entire Amazon SES account) are reset.

              If  email  sending for the configuration set has never been dis-
              abled and later re-enabled, the value of this attribute is  null
              .
