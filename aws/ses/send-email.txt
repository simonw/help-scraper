SEND-EMAIL()                                                      SEND-EMAIL()



NAME
       send-email -

DESCRIPTION
       Composes an email message and immediately queues it for sending. In or-
       der to send email using the SendEmail operation, your message must meet
       the following requirements:

       o The  message must be sent from a verified email address or domain. If
         you attempt to send email using a non-verified address or domain, the
         operation will result in an "Email address not verified" error.

       o If your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox, you may only send
         to verified addresses or domains, or to  email  addresses  associated
         with  the  Amazon  SES  Mailbox  Simulator. For more information, see
         Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in  the  Amazon  SES  Developer
         Guide.

       o The maximum message size is 10 MB.

       o The  message  must  include at least one recipient email address. The
         recipient address can be a To: address, a CC: address, or a BCC:  ad-
         dress. If a recipient email address is invalid (that is, it is not in
         the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ),  the  entire
         message  will be rejected, even if the message contains other recipi-
         ents that are valid.

       o The message may not include more than 50 recipients, across the  To:,
         CC: and BCC: fields. If you need to send an email message to a larger
         audience, you can divide your recipient list into  groups  of  50  or
         fewer,  and  then  call the SendEmail operation several times to send
         the message to each group.

       WARNING:
          For every message that you send, the total number of recipients (in-
          cluding  each  recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted
          against the maximum number of emails you can send in a  24-hour  pe-
          riod  (your sending quota ). For more information about sending quo-
          tas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES  Sending  Limits  in
          the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

          {
            "Subject": {
              "Data": "string",
              "Charset": "string"
            },
            "Body": {
              "Text": {
                "Data": "string",
                "Charset": "string"
              },
              "Html": {
                "Data": "string",
                "Charset": "string"
              }
            }
          }

       --reply-to-addresses (list)
          The  reply-to  email  address(es)  for the message. If the recipient
          replies to the message, each reply-to address will receive  the  re-
          ply.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --return-path (string)
          The  email  address that bounces and complaints will be forwarded to
          when feedback forwarding is enabled. If the message cannot be deliv-
          ered  to  the recipient, then an error message will be returned from
          the recipient's ISP; this message will  then  be  forwarded  to  the
          email  address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath
          parameter is never overwritten. This email address  must  be  either
          individually  verified  with  Amazon  SES, or from a domain that has
          been verified with Amazon SES.

       --source-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of  the  identity  that is associated with the sending authorization
          policy that permits you to send for the email address  specified  in
          the Source parameter.

          For   example,   if   the   owner  of  example.com  (which  has  ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy  to  it  that  authorizes you to send from user@example.com ,
          then    you    would     specify     the     SourceArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          Source to be user@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --return-path-arn (string)
          This parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN
          of the identity that is associated with  the  sending  authorization
          policy  that  permits  you to use the email address specified in the
          ReturnPath parameter.

          For  example,  if  the  owner  of   example.com   (which   has   ARN
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a
          policy to it that authorizes you to use feedback@example.com ,  then
          you      would      specify      the     ReturnPathArn     to     be
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com  ,  and  the
          ReturnPath to be feedback@example.com .

          For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES
          Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags, in the form of name/value  pairs,  to  apply  to  an
          email  that you send using SendEmail . Tags correspond to character-
          istics of the email that you define, so that you can  publish  email
          sending events.

          (structure)
              Contains  the  name  and  value of a tag that you can provide to
              SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.

              Message tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable  you
              to  publish  email  sending  events. For information about using
              configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the tag. The name must:

                 o This value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z),  num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag. The value must:

                 o This  value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), num-
                   bers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).

                 o Contain less than 256 characters.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --configuration-set-name (string)
          The name of the configuration set to use when you send an email  us-
          ing SendEmail .

       --from (string)
          The email address that is sending the email. This email address must
          be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or  from  a  domain
          that  has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about veri-
          fying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          If you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted
          to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also spec-
          ify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending  au-
          thorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .

          NOTE:
              Amazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described
              in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of a  source  email
              address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign)
              may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part  of
              an  address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII char-
              acters, they must be encoded using  Punycode,  as  described  in
              RFC3492 . The sender name (also known as the friendly name ) may
              contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must  be  encoded
              using  MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 . MIME
              encoded-word syntax uses the  following  form:  =?charset?encod-
              ing?encoded-text?= .

       --to  (string)  The  email addresses of the primary recipients. You can
       specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --cc (string) The email addresses of  copy  recipients  (Cc).  You  can
       specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --bcc  (string)  The  email  addresses  of blind-carbon-copy recipients
       (Bcc). You can specify multiple recipients as space-separated values

       --subject (string) The subject of the message

       --text (string) The raw text body of the message

       --html (string) The HTML body of the message

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To send a formatted email using Amazon SES

       The  following  example uses the send-email command to send a formatted
       email:

          aws ses send-email --from sender@example.com --destination file://destination.json --message file://message.json

       Output:

          {
             "MessageId": "EXAMPLEf3a5efcd1-51adec81-d2a4-4e3f-9fe2-5d85c1b23783-000000"
          }

       The destination and the message are JSON data structures saved in .json
       files in the current directory. These files are as follows:

       destination.json:

          {
            "ToAddresses":  ["recipient1@example.com", "recipient2@example.com"],
            "CcAddresses":  ["recipient3@example.com"],
            "BccAddresses": []
          }

       message.json:

          {
             "Subject": {
                 "Data": "Test email sent using the AWS CLI",
                 "Charset": "UTF-8"
             },
             "Body": {
                 "Text": {
                     "Data": "This is the message body in text format.",
                     "Charset": "UTF-8"
                 },
                 "Html": {
                     "Data": "This message body contains HTML formatting. It can, for example, contain links like this one: <a class=\"ulink\" href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon SES Developer Guide</a>.",
                     "Charset": "UTF-8"
                 }
             }
          }

       Replace the sender and recipient email addresses with the ones you want
       to use. Note that the sender's email address must be verified with Ama-
       zon  SES.  Until  you  are granted production access to Amazon SES, you
       must also verify the email address of each recipient unless the recipi-
       ent  is the Amazon SES mailbox simulator. For more information on veri-
       fication, see Verifying Email Addresses and Domains in  Amazon  SES  in
       the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.

       The  Message ID in the output indicates that the call to send-email was
       successful.

       If you don't receive the email, check your Junk box.

       For more information on sending formatted email, see Sending  Formatted
       Email  Using  the Amazon SES API in the Amazon Simple Email Service De-
       veloper Guide.

OUTPUT
       MessageId -> (string)
          The unique message identifier returned from the SendEmail action.
