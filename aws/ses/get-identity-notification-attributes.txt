GET-IDENTITY-NOTIFICATION-ATTRIBUTES()  GET-IDENTITY-NOTIFICATION-ATTRIBUTES()



NAME
       get-identity-notification-attributes -

DESCRIPTION
       Given  a  list of verified identities (email addresses and/or domains),
       returns a structure describing identity notification attributes.

       This operation is throttled at one request per second and can only  get
       notification attributes for up to 100 identities at a time.

       For more information about using notifications with Amazon SES, see the
       Amazon SES Developer Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-identity-notification-attributes
          --identities <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --identities (list)
          A list of one or more identities. You can specify an identity by us-
          ing  its  name or by using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). Examples:
          user@example.com             ,             example.com             ,
          arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the Amazon SES notification attributes for a list of identities

       The  following  example  uses  the get-identity-notification-attributes
       command to retrieve the Amazon SES notification attributes for  a  list
       of identities:

          aws ses get-identity-notification-attributes --identities "user1@example.com" "user2@example.com"

       Output:

          {
             "NotificationAttributes": {
                 "user1@example.com": {
                     "ForwardingEnabled": false,
                     "ComplaintTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic",
                     "BounceTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic",
                     "DeliveryTopic": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:EXAMPLE65304:MyTopic"
                 },
                 "user2@example.com": {
                     "ForwardingEnabled": true
                 }
             }
          }

       This  command  returns  the status of email feedback forwarding and, if
       applicable, the Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Amazon  SNS  topics
       that bounce, complaint, and delivery notifications are sent to.

       If you call this command with an identity that you have never submitted
       for verification, that identity won't appear in the output.

       For more information about notifications, see Using Notifications  With
       Amazon SES in the Amazon Simple Email Service Developer Guide.
