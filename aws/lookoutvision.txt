DESCRIPTION
       This  is  the  Amazon Lookout for Vision API Reference. It provides de-
       scriptions of actions, data types, common parameters,  and  common  er-
       rors.

       Amazon  Lookout for Vision enables you to find visual defects in indus-
       trial products, accurately and at scale. It  uses  computer  vision  to
       identify  missing  components in an industrial product, damage to vehi-
       cles or structures, irregularities in production lines, and even minus-
       cule  defects in silicon wafers  or any other physical item where qual-
       ity is important such as a missing capacitor on printed circuit boards.
