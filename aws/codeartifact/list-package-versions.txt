LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()                                LIST-PACKAGE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-package-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of PackageVersionSummary objects for package versions in
       a repository that match the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-package-versions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: versions

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the requested package versions.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The  name of the repository that contains the requested package ver-
          sions.

       --format (string)
          The format of the returned package versions.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package that  contains  the  requested  package
          versions. The package component that specifies its namespace depends
          on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o Python and NuGet packages do not contain  a  corresponding  compo-
            nent, packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The  name  of the package for which you want to request package ver-
          sions.

       --status (string)
          A string that filters the requested package versions by status.

          Possible values:

          o Published

          o Unfinished

          o Unlisted

          o Archived

          o Disposed

          o Deleted

       --sort-by (string)
          How to sort the requested list of package versions.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLISHED_TIME

       --origin-type (string)
          The originType used to filter package versions.  Only  package  ver-
          sions with the provided originType will be returned.

          Possible values:

          o INTERNAL

          o EXTERNAL

          o UNKNOWN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list package versions for a package

       The  following  list-package-versions example returns a list of package
       versions for a package named kind-of.

          aws codeartifact list-package-versions \
              --package kind-of \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo \
              --format npm

          {
              "defaultDisplayVersion": "1.0.1",
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "kind-of",

OUTPUT
       defaultDisplayVersion -> (string)
          The  default package version to display. This depends on the package
          format:

          o For Maven and PyPI packages,  it's  the  most  recently  published
            package version.

          o For  npm  packages, it's the version referenced by the latest tag.
            If the latest tag is not set, it's  the  most  recently  published
            package version.

       format -> (string)
          A format of the package.

       namespace -> (string)
          The  namespace  of  the  package that contains the requested package
          versions. The package component that specifies its namespace depends
          on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o Python  and  NuGet  packages do not contain a corresponding compo-
            nent, packages of those formats do not have a namespace.

       package -> (string)
          The name of the package.

       versions -> (list)
          The returned list of PackageVersionSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package version, including its status,  version,
              and  revision.  The ListPackageVersions operation returns a list
              of PackageVersionSummary objects.

              version -> (string)
                 Information about a package version.

              revision -> (string)
                 The revision associated with a package version.

              status -> (string)
                 A string that contains the status of the package version.  It
                 can be one of the following:

              origin -> (structure)
                 A PackageVersionOrigin object that contains information about
                 how the package version was added to the repository.

                 domainEntryPoint -> (structure)
                     A DomainEntryPoint object that contains information about
                     from  which repository or external connection the package
                     version was added to the domain.

                     repositoryName -> (string)
                        The name of the repository that a package  was  origi-
                        nally published to.

                     externalConnectionName -> (string)
                        The name of the external connection that a package was
                        ingested from.

                 originType -> (string)
                     Describes how the package version was originally added to
                     the  domain.  An  INTERNAL  origin type means the package
                     version was published directly to a repository in the do-
                     main.  An  EXTERNAL origin type means the package version
                     was ingested from an external connection.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.
