CREATE-DOMAIN()                                                CREATE-DOMAIN()



NAME
       create-domain -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a domain. CodeArtifact domains make it easier to manage multi-
       ple repositories across an organization. You can use a domain to  apply
       permissions  across  many repositories owned by different AWS accounts.
       An asset is stored only once in a domain,  even  if  it's  in  multiple
       repositories.

       Although  you  can have multiple domains, we recommend a single produc-
       tion domain that contains all published artifacts so that your develop-
       ment  teams  can find and share packages. You can use a second pre-pro-
       duction domain to test changes to the production domain configuration.

SYNOPSIS
            create-domain
          --domain <value>
          [--encryption-key <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain to create. All domain names in an AWS  Region
          that  are in the same AWS account must be unique. The domain name is
          used as the prefix in DNS hostnames. Do not use  sensitive  informa-
          tion in a domain name because it is publicly discoverable.

       --encryption-key (string)
          The  encryption  key for the domain. This is used to encrypt content
          stored in a domain. An encryption key can be a key ID, a key  Amazon
          Resource  Name (ARN), a key alias, or a key alias ARN. To specify an
          encryptionKey , your IAM role must have kms:DescribeKey and kms:Cre-
          ateGrant  permissions  on  the encryption key that is used. For more
          information, see DescribeKey in the AWS Key Management  Service  API
          Reference  and AWS KMS API Permissions Reference in the AWS Key Man-
          agement Service Developer Guide .

          WARNING:
              CodeArtifact supports only symmetric CMKs. Do not  associate  an
              asymmetric CMK with your domain. For more information, see Using
              symmetric and asymmetric keys in the AWS Key Management  Service
              Developer Guide .

       --tags (list)
          One or more tag key-value pairs for the domain.

          (structure)
              A  tag  is  a  key-value pair that can be used to manage, search
              for, or filter resources in AWS CodeArtifact.

              key -> (string)
                 The tag key.

              value -> (string)
                 The tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "string",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create a domain

       The following create-domain example creates a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact create-domain \
              --domain test-domain

       Output:

          {
              "domain": {
                  "name": "test-domain",
                  "owner": "111122223333",
                  "arn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:us-west-2:111122223333:domain/test-domain",
                  "status": "Active",
                  "createdTime": "2020-10-20T13:16:48.559000-04:00",
                  "encryptionKey": "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
                  "repositoryCount": 0,
                  "assetSizeBytes": 0
              }
          }
