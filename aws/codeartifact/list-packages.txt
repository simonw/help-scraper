LIST-PACKAGES()                                                LIST-PACKAGES()



NAME
       list-packages -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of PackageSummary objects for packages in a repository
       that match the request parameters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-packages is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: packages

SYNOPSIS
            list-packages
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--format <value>]
          [--namespace <value>]
          [--package-prefix <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain that contains the repository that contains
          the requested list of packages.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository from which packages are to be listed.

       --format (string)
          The format of the packages. The valid package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven  : A Maven package that contains compiled code in a distrib-
            utable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace of the package. The package component  that  specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding component, so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package-prefix (string)
          A prefix used to filter returned packages. Only packages with  names
          that start with packagePrefix are returned.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list packages in a repository

       The following list-packages example list packages in a repository named
       test-repo in a domain named test-domain.

          aws codeartifact list-packages \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo

       Output:

          {
              "packages": [
                  {
                      "format": "npm",
                      "package": "lodash"
                  }
                  {
                      "format": "python",
                      "package": "test-package"
                  }
              ]
          }

       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       packages -> (list)
          The list of returned PackageSummary objects.

          (structure)
              Details about a package, including its  format,  namespace,  and
              name.  The  ListPackages operation returns a list of PackageSum-
              mary objects.

              format -> (string)
                 The format of the package. Valid values are:

                 o npm

                 o pypi

                 o maven

              namespace -> (string)
                 The namespace of the  package.  The  package  component  that
                 specifies its namespace depends on its type. For example:

                 o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

                 o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

                 o A  Python  package  does not contain a corresponding compo-
                   nent, so Python packages do not have a namespace.

              package -> (string)
                 The name of the package.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If there are additional results, this is the token for the next  set
          of results.
