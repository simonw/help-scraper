NAME
       list-package-version-assets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of AssetSummary objects for assets in a package version.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-package-version-assets  is  a  paginated  operation.  Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: assets

SYNOPSIS
            list-package-version-assets
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          --format <value>
          [--namespace <value>]
          --package <value>
          --package-version <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the repository associated  with
          the package version assets.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that contains the package  that  contains
          the returned package version assets.

       --format (string)
          The format of the package that contains the returned package version
          assets. The valid package types are:

          o npm : A Node Package Manager (npm) package.

          o pypi : A Python Package Index (PyPI) package.

          o maven : A Maven package that contains compiled code in a  distrib-
            utable format, such as a JAR file.

          Possible values:

          o npm

          o pypi

          o maven

          o nuget

       --namespace (string)
          The  namespace  of the package. The package component that specifies
          its namespace depends on its type. For example:

          o The namespace of a Maven package is its groupId .

          o The namespace of an npm package is its scope .

          o A Python package does not contain a  corresponding  component,  so
            Python packages do not have a namespace.

       --package (string)
          The  name  of the package that contains the returned package version
          assets.

       --package-version (string)
          A string that contains the package version (for example, 3.5.2 ).

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To view a package version's assets

       The  following list-package-version-assets example retrieves the assets
       for version 4.0.0 of an npm package named test-package.

          aws codeartifact list-package-version-assets \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repo test-repo \
              --format npm \
              --package test-package \
              --package-version 4.0.0

       Output:

          {
              "format": "npm",
              "package": "test-package",

                          "SHA-256": "d2aa8c6afc3c8591765785a37d1c5acae482a8eb3ab9729ed28922692454f2e2",
                          "SHA-512": "3e585d15c8a594e20d7de57b362ea81754c011acb2641a19f1b72c8531ea39825896bab344ae616a0a5a824cb9a381df0b3cddd534645cf305aba70a93dac698"

          }
