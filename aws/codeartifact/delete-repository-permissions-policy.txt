DELETE-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()  DELETE-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       delete-repository-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  the  resource  policy that is set on a repository. After a re-
       source policy is deleted, the permissions allowed  and  denied  by  the
       deleted  policy  are  removed. The effect of deleting a resource policy
       might not be immediate.

       WARNING:
          Use DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy with caution. After  a  policy
          is  deleted, AWS users, roles, and accounts lose permissions to per-
          form the repository actions granted by the deleted policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-repository-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--policy-revision <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain that contains the repository associated  with
          the resource policy to be deleted.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository that is associated with the resource pol-
          icy to be deleted

       --policy-revision (string)
          The revision of the repository's resource policy to be deleted. This
          revision is used for optimistic locking, which prevents others  from
          accidentally  overwriting  your changes to the repository's resource
          policy.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete a permissions policy from a repository

       The following delete-repository-permissions-policy example deletes  the
       permission policy from a repository named test-repo.

          aws codeartifact delete-repository-permissions-policy \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo

       Output:

          {
