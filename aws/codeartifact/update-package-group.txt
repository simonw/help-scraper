OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The  name  of  the domain which contains the package group to be up-
          dated.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the Amazon Web Services account  that
          owns the domain. It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --package-group (string)
          The pattern of the package group to be updated.

       --contact-info (string)
          Contact  information  which you want to update the requested package
          group with.

       --description (string)
          The description you want to update the requested package group with.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

              The ARN of the package group.

          pattern -> (string)
              The pattern of the package group. The pattern  determines  which

              The description of the package group.

          originConfiguration -> (structure)
              The package group origin configuration that determines how pack-
              age versions can enter repositories.

              restrictions -> (map)
                 The origin configuration settings that determine how  package

                 value -> (structure)
                     Contains information about the configured restrictions of
                     the origin controls of a package group.

                     mode -> (string)
                        The package group origin restriction setting.  If  the

                        value of effectiveMode is the value  of  mode  of  the

                        the value of mode of the first parent group which does
                        not have a value of INHERIT .

                            package  group,  and is also the identifier of the
                            package group.
