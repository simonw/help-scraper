PUT-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()        PUT-REPOSITORY-PERMISSIONS-POLICY()



NAME
       put-repository-permissions-policy -

DESCRIPTION
       Sets  the resource policy on a repository that specifies permissions to
       access it.

       When you call PutRepositoryPermissionsPolicy , the resource  policy  on
       the repository is ignored when evaluting permissions. This ensures that
       the owner of a repository cannot lock themselves out of the repository,
       which would prevent them from being able to update the resource policy.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            put-repository-permissions-policy
          --domain <value>
          [--domain-owner <value>]
          --repository <value>
          [--policy-revision <value>]
          --policy-document <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --domain (string)
          The name of the domain containing the repository to set the resource
          policy on.

       --domain-owner (string)
          The 12-digit account number of the AWS account that owns the domain.
          It does not include dashes or spaces.

       --repository (string)
          The name of the repository to set the resource policy on.

       --policy-revision (string)
          Sets  the revision of the resource policy that specifies permissions
          to access the repository. This revision is used for optimistic lock-
          ing,  which  prevents  others  from  overwriting your changes to the
          repository's resource policy.

       --policy-document (string)
          A valid displayable JSON Aspen policy string to be set as the access
          control resource policy on the provided repository.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To attach a permissions policy to a repository

       The following put-repository-permissions-policy example attaches a per-
       mission policy that is defined in the policy.json file to a  repository
       named test-repo.

          aws codeartifact put-repository-permissions-policy \
              --domain test-domain \
              --repository test-repo \
              --policy-document file://PATH/TO/policy.json

       Output:

          {
              "policy": {
                  "resourceArn": "arn:aws:codeartifact:region-id:111122223333:repository/test-domain/test-repo",
                  "document": "{ ...policy document content...}",
                  "revision": "MQlyyTQRASRU3HB58gBtSDHXG7Q3hvxxxxxxx="
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       policy -> (structure)
          The resource policy that was set after processing the request.

          resourceArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the resource associated with the resource policy

          revision -> (string)
              The current revision of the resource policy.

          document -> (string)
              The resource policy formatted in JSON.
