NAME
       batch -

DESCRIPTION
       Using  Batch,  you  can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
       Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers,  sci-
       entists,  and  engineers  to access large amounts of compute resources.
       Batch uses the advantages of the batch computing to remove  the  undif-
       ferentiated  heavy  lifting of configuring and managing required infra-
       structure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch  computing
       software approach. You can use Batch to efficiently provision resources
       d, and work toward  eliminating  capacity  constraints,  reducing  your
       overall compute costs, and delivering results more quickly.

       As  a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of
       any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources  and  opti-
       mizes  workload  distribution  based  on the quantity and scale of your
       specific workloads. With Batch, there's no need to  install  or  manage
       batch  computing  software.  This means that you can focus on analyzing
       results and solving your specific problems instead.
