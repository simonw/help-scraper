LIST-OPS-ITEM-EVENTS()                                  LIST-OPS-ITEM-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-ops-item-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of all OpsItem events in the current Amazon Web Services
       Region and Amazon Web Services account. You can limit  the  results  to
       events associated with specific OpsItems by specifying a filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-ops-item-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-ops-item-events
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One or more OpsItem filters. Use a filter to return a more  specific
          list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes  a  filter  for a specific list of OpsItem events. You
              can filter event information by using tags. You specify tags  by
              using a key-value pair mapping.

              Key -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  filter key. Currently, the only supported
                 value is OpsItemId .

              Values -> (list)
                 The values for the filter, consisting of one or more  OpsItem
                 IDs.

                 (string)

              Operator -> (string)
                 The  operator  used  by  the filter call. Currently, the only
                 supported value is Equal .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Operator=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "OpsItemId",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Operator": "Equal"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.

       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of event information for the specified OpsItems.

          (structure)
              Summary information about an OpsItem event or that associated an
              OpsItem with a related item.

              OpsItemId -> (string)
                 The ID of the OpsItem.

              EventId -> (string)
                 The ID of the OpsItem event.

              Source -> (string)
                 The source of the OpsItem event.

              DetailType -> (string)
                 The type of information provided as a detail.

              Detail -> (string)
                 Specific information about the OpsItem event.

              CreatedBy -> (structure)
                 Information about the user or resource that created  the  Op-
                 sItem event.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the IAM entity that
                     created the OpsItem event.

              CreatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the OpsItem event was created.
