LIST-COMMAND-INVOCATIONS()                          LIST-COMMAND-INVOCATIONS()



NAME
       list-command-invocations -

DESCRIPTION
       An  invocation  is copy of a command sent to a specific managed node. A
       command can apply to one or more managed nodes.  A  command  invocation
       applies  to  one  managed node. For example, if a user runs SendCommand
       against three managed nodes, then a command invocation is  created  for
       each  requested  managed node ID. ListCommandInvocations provide status
       about command execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-command-invocations is a paginated operation. Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: CommandInvocations

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Optional) The invocations for a specific command ID.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Optional) The command execution details for a specific managed node
          ID.

       --filters (list)
          (Optional) One or more filters. Use a filter to return a  more  spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes a command filter.

              NOTE:
                 A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is
                 Pending because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The ExecutionStage filter can't be used with the ListCom-
                     mandInvocations operation, only with ListCommands .

              value -> (string)
                 The  filter  value.  Valid  values for each filter key are as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter : Specify a timestamp to limit  your  results.
                   For  example, specify 2024-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of
                   command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore : Specify a timestamp to limit your  results.
                   For  example, specify 2024-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list of
                   command executions from before July 7, 2021.

                 o Status : Specify a valid command status to see  a  list  of
                   all command executions with that status. The status choices
                   depend on the API you call. The status values you can spec-
                   ify for ListCommands are:

                   o Pending

                   o InProgress

                   o Success

                   o Cancelled

                   o Failed

                   o TimedOut  (this includes both Delivery and Execution time
                     outs)

                   o AccessDenied

                   o DeliveryTimedOut

                   o ExecutionTimedOut

                   o Incomplete

                   o NoInstancesInTag

                   o LimitExceeded

                 The status values you can specify for  ListCommandInvocations
                 are:

                     o Pending

                     o InProgress

                     o Delayed

                     o Success

                     o Cancelled

                     o Failed

                     o TimedOut  (this  includes  both  Delivery and Execution
                       time outs)

                     o AccessDenied

                     o DeliveryTimedOut

                     o ExecutionTimedOut

                     o Undeliverable

                     o InvalidPlatform

                     o Terminated

                 o DocumentName : Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Sys-
                   tems  Manager document (SSM document) for which you want to
                   see  command  execution  results.  For   example,   specify
                   AWS-RunPatchBaseline  to  see  command executions that used
                   this SSM document to perform security  patching  operations
                   on managed nodes.

                 o ExecutionStage : Specify one of the following values (List-
                   Commands operations only):

                   o Executing : Returns a list of command executions that are
                     currently still running.

                   o Complete : Returns a list of command executions that have
                     already completed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Status"|"ExecutionStage"|"DocumentName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --details | --no-details (boolean)
          (Optional) If set this returns the response of  the  command  execu-
          tions and any command output. The default value is false .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the invocations of a specific command

       The following list-command-invocations example lists  all  the  invoca-
       tions of a command.

OUTPUT
       CommandInvocations -> (list)
          (Optional) A list of all invocations.

          (structure)
              An invocation is a copy of a command sent to a specific  managed
              node.  A  command can apply to one or more managed nodes. A com-
              mand invocation applies to one managed node. For example,  if  a
              user  runs  SendCommand against three managed nodes, then a com-
              mand invocation is created for each requested managed node ID. A
              command invocation returns status and detail information about a
              command you ran.

              CommandId -> (string)
                 The command against which this invocation was requested.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The managed node ID in which this invocation was requested.

              InstanceName -> (string)
                 The fully qualified host name of the managed node.

              Comment -> (string)
                 User-specified information about the command, such as a brief
                 description of what the command should do.

              DocumentName -> (string)
                 The document name that was requested for execution.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The Systems Manager document (SSM document) version.

              RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time and date the request was sent to this managed node.

              Status -> (string)
                 Whether  or not the invocation succeeded, failed, or is pend-
                 ing.

              StatusDetails -> (string)
                 A detailed status of the command execution for  each  invoca-
                 tion  (each  managed node targeted by the command). StatusDe-
                 tails includes more information than Status  because  it  in-
                 cludes  states  resulting  from error and concurrency control
                 parameters. StatusDetails can  show  different  results  than
                 Status.  For  more  information  about  these  statuses,  see
                 Understanding command statuses in  the  Amazon  Web  Services
                 Systems  Manager User Guide . StatusDetails can be one of the
                 following values:

                 o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed node.

                 o In Progress: The command has been sent to the managed  node
                   but hasn't reached a terminal state.

                 o Success:  The  execution  of the command or plugin was suc-
                   cessfully completed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Delivery Timed Out: The command  wasn't  delivered  to  the
                   managed  node before the delivery timeout expired. Delivery
                   timeouts don't count against the parent command's MaxErrors
                   limit, but they do contribute to whether the parent command
                   status is Success or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

                 o Execution Timed Out: Command execution started on the  man-
                   aged node, but the execution wasn't complete before the ex-
                   ecution timeout expired. Execution timeouts  count  against
                   the MaxErrors limit of the parent command. This is a termi-
                   nal state.

                 o Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed  node.
                   For  a  plugin,  this indicates that the result code wasn't
                   zero. For a command invocation, this indicates that the re-
                   sult  code  for one or more plugins wasn't zero. Invocation
                   failures count against the MaxErrors limit  of  the  parent
                   command. This is a terminal state.

                 o Cancelled:  The  command  was terminated before it was com-
                   pleted. This is a terminal state.

                 o Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to  the  man-
                   aged node. The managed node might not exist or might not be
                   responding. Undeliverable invocations don't  count  against
                   the  parent  command's MaxErrors limit and don't contribute
                   to whether the parent command status is Success  or  Incom-
                   plete. This is a terminal state.

                 o Terminated: The parent command exceeded its MaxErrors limit
                   and subsequent command invocations  were  canceled  by  the
                   system. This is a terminal state.

                 o Delayed:  The  system  attempted to send the command to the
                   managed node but  wasn't  successful.  The  system  retries
                   again.

              TraceOutput -> (string)
                 Gets the trace output sent by the agent.

              StandardOutputUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL to the plugin's StdOut file in Amazon Simple Storage
                 Service (Amazon S3), if the S3 bucket  was  defined  for  the
                 parent command. For an invocation, StandardOutputUrl is popu-
                 lated if there is just one plugin defined  for  the  command,
                 and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              StandardErrorUrl -> (string)
                 The  URL to the plugin's StdErr file in Amazon Simple Storage
                 Service (Amazon S3), if the S3 bucket  was  defined  for  the
                 parent  command. For an invocation, StandardErrorUrl is popu-
                 lated if there is just one plugin defined  for  the  command,
                 and the S3 bucket was defined for the command.

              CommandPlugins -> (list)
                 Plugins processed by the command.

                 (structure)
                     Describes plugin details.

                     Name -> (string)
                        The  name of the plugin. Must be one of the following:
                        aws:updateAgent , aws:domainjoin , aws:applications  ,
                        aws:runPowerShellScript  ,  aws:psmodule  , aws:cloud-
                        Watch , aws:runShellScript , or aws:updateSSMAgent .

                     Status -> (string)
                        The status of this plugin. You can run a document with
                        multiple plugins.

                     StatusDetails -> (string)
                        A  detailed  status of the plugin execution. StatusDe-
                        tails includes more information than Status because it
                        includes  states  resulting from error and concurrency
                        control parameters. StatusDetails can  show  different
                        results  than Status. For more information about these
                        statuses, see Understanding command  statuses  in  the
                        Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager User Guide . Sta-
                        tusDetails can be one of the following values:

                        o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to the managed
                          node.

                        o In  Progress:  The command has been sent to the man-
                          aged node but hasn't reached a terminal state.

                        o Success: The execution of the command or plugin  was
                          successfully completed. This is a terminal state.

                        o Delivery  Timed Out: The command wasn't delivered to
                          the managed node before  the  delivery  timeout  ex-
                          pired.  Delivery  timeouts  don't  count against the
                          parent command's MaxErrors limit, but they  do  con-
                          tribute to whether the parent command status is Suc-
                          cess or Incomplete. This is a terminal state.

                        o Execution Timed Out: Command  execution  started  on
                          the  managed node, but the execution wasn't complete
                          before  the  execution  timeout  expired.  Execution
                          timeouts  count  against  the MaxErrors limit of the
                          parent command. This is a terminal state.

                        o Failed: The command wasn't successful on the managed
                          node.  For  a plugin, this indicates that the result
                          code wasn't zero. For a command invocation, this in-
                          dicates that the result code for one or more plugins
                          wasn't zero. Invocation failures count  against  the
                          MaxErrors  limit  of  the  parent command. This is a
                          terminal state.

                        o Cancelled: The command was terminated before it  was
                          completed. This is a terminal state.

                        o Undeliverable: The command can't be delivered to the
                          managed node. The managed node might not  exist,  or
                          it  might  not  be responding. Undeliverable invoca-
                          tions don't count against the parent command's  Max-
                          Errors  limit,  and they don't contribute to whether
                          the parent command status is Success or  Incomplete.
                          This is a terminal state.

                        o Terminated:  The  parent command exceeded its MaxEr-
                          rors limit and subsequent command  invocations  were
                          canceled by the system. This is a terminal state.

                     ResponseCode -> (integer)
                        A  numeric  response  code generated after running the
                        plugin.

                     ResponseStartDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time the plugin started running.

                     ResponseFinishDateTime -> (timestamp)
                        The time the plugin stopped running. Could stop prema-
                        turely if, for example, a cancel command was sent.

                     Output -> (string)
                        Output of the plugin execution.

                     StandardOutputUrl -> (string)
                        The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to
                        stdout in Amazon S3. If the S3 bucket for the  command
                        wasn't specified, then this string is empty.

                     StandardErrorUrl -> (string)
                        The URL for the complete text written by the plugin to
                        stderr. If execution isn't  yet  complete,  then  this
                        string is empty.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this parameter.
                        The system ignores it. Instead,  Amazon  Web  Services
                        Systems Manager automatically determines the S3 bucket
                        region.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket where the responses to the command  exe-
                        cutions  should be stored. This was requested when is-
                        suing the command. For example, in the  following  re-
                        sponse:
                            amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-prefix/i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                            PLE/awsrunShellScript

                            amzn-s3-demo-bucket is the name of the S3 bucket;

                            my-prefix is the name of the S3 prefix;

                            i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE is the managed node ID;

                            awsrunShellScript is the name of the plugin.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 directory path inside the bucket where the  re-
                        sponses  to  the  command executions should be stored.
                        This was requested when issuing the command. For exam-
                        ple, in the following response:
                            amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-prefix/i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                            PLE/awsrunShellScript

                            amzn-s3-demo-bucket is the name of the S3 bucket;

                            my-prefix is the name of the S3 prefix;

                            i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE is the managed node ID;

                            awsrunShellScript is the name of the plugin.

              ServiceRole -> (string)

                     notifications about command status changes to this topic.

                 NotificationEvents -> (list)
                     The different events for which you can receive  notifica-
                     tions.  To  learn more about these events, see Monitoring
                     Systems Manager status changes using Amazon SNS notifica-
                     tions  in  the  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager User

                     The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you  want
                     to  send  command  output.  If  you don't specify a group
                     name, Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager  automatically
                     creates  a log group for you. The log group uses the fol-
                     lowing naming format:
