LIST-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()                                LIST-COMPLIANCE-ITEMS()



NAME
       list-compliance-items -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a specified resource ID, this API operation returns a list of com-
       pliance statuses for different resource types. Currently, you can  only
       specify  one  resource ID per call. List results depend on the criteria
       specified in the filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-compliance-items is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: ComplianceItems

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          One  or  more compliance filters. Use a filter to return a more spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for which to search.

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The  type  of  comparison  that  should  be performed for the
                 value: Equal, NotEqual, BeginWith, LessThan, or GreaterThan.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "EQUAL"|"NOT_EQUAL"|"BEGIN_WITH"|"LESS_THAN"|"GREATER_THAN"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --resource-ids (list)
          The ID for the resources from which to get  compliance  information.
          Currently, you can only specify one resource ID.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --resource-types (list)
          The  type of resource from which to get compliance information. Cur-
          rently, the only supported resource type is ManagedInstance .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ComplianceItems -> (list)
          A list of compliance information for the specified resource ID.

          (structure)
              Information  about  the  compliance  as  defined by the resource
              type. For example, for a patch resource type, Items includes in-
              formation about the PatchSeverity, Classification, and so on.

              ComplianceType -> (string)
                 The  compliance  type.  For example, Association (for a State
                 Manager association), Patch, or Custom:string are  all  valid
                 compliance types.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type  of resource. ManagedInstance is currently the only
                 supported resource type.

              ResourceId -> (string)
                 An ID for the resource. For a managed node, this is the  node
                 ID.

              Id -> (string)
                 An ID for the compliance item. For example, if the compliance
                 item is a Windows patch, the ID could be the number of the KB
                 article; for example: KB4010320.

              Title -> (string)
                 A  title for the compliance item. For example, if the compli-
                 ance item is a Windows patch, the title could be the title of
                 the  KB  article  for the patch; for example: Security Update
                 for Active Directory Federation Services.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the compliance item. An item is either  COMPLI-
                 ANT,  NON_COMPLIANT,  or an empty string (for Windows patches
                 that aren't applicable).

              Severity -> (string)
                 The severity of the compliance status. Severity can be one of
                 the  following:  Critical,  High, Medium, Low, Informational,
                 Unspecified.

              ExecutionSummary -> (structure)
                 A summary for the compliance item. The  summary  includes  an
                 execution  ID, the execution type (for example, command), and
                 the execution time.

                 ExecutionTime -> (timestamp)
                     The time the execution ran as a datetime object  that  is
                     saved in the following format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'.

                 ExecutionId -> (string)
                     An  ID  created by the system when PutComplianceItems was
                     called. For example, CommandID is a valid  execution  ID.
                     You can use this ID in subsequent calls.

                 ExecutionType -> (string)
                     The  type  of  execution. For example, Command is a valid
                     execution type.

              Details -> (map)
                 A "Key": "Value" tag combination for the compliance item.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return. Use this token to get
          the next set of results.
