NAME
       describe-instance-patch-states -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the high-level patch state of one or more managed nodes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-patch-states  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: InstancePatchStates

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-patch-states
          --instance-ids <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The ID of the managed node for which patch state information  should
          be retrieved.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       InstancePatchStates -> (list)
          The high-level patch state for the requested managed nodes.

          (structure)
              Defines the high-level patch  compliance  state  for  a  managed
              node, providing information about the number of installed, miss-
              ing, not applicable, and  failed  patches  along  with  metadata
              about  the  operation when this information was gathered for the
              managed node.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The ID of the managed node the  high-level  patch  compliance
                 information was collected for.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the patch group the managed node belongs to.

              BaselineId -> (string)
                 The ID of the patch baseline used to patch the managed node.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the patch baseline snapshot used during the patch-
                 ing operation when this compliance data was collected.

              InstallOverrideList -> (string)
                 An https URL or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon  S3)
                 path-style  URL  to  a  list of patches to be installed. This
                 patch installation list, which you maintain in an  S3  bucket
                 in  YAML format and specify in the SSM document AWS-RunPatch-
                 Baseline , overrides the patches  specified  by  the  default
                 patch baseline.

                 For more information about the InstallOverrideList parameter,
                 see         About         the         ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline`
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager-about-aws-runpatchbaseline.html`__
                 SSM document in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  User
                 Guide .

              OwnerInformation -> (string)
                 Placeholder  information.  This field will always be empty in
                 the current release of the service.

              InstalledCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline  that  are  in-
                 stalled on the managed node.

              InstalledOtherCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches  not specified in the patch baseline
                 that are installed on the managed node.

              InstalledPendingRebootCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches installed by Patch  Manager  since  the
                 last time the managed node was rebooted.

              InstalledRejectedCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of  patches installed on a managed node that are
                 specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of
                 InstalledRejected  were  typically installed before they were
                 added to a RejectedPatches list.

                 NOTE:
                     If ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY is the specified  option  for  Re-
                     jectedPatchesAction , the value of InstalledRejectedCount
                     will always be 0 (zero).

              MissingCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that are appli-
                 cable for the managed node but aren't currently installed.

              FailedCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of patches from the patch baseline that were at-
                 tempted to be installed during the last  patching  operation,
                 but failed to install.

              UnreportedNotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches beyond the supported limit of NotAppli-
                 cableCount that aren't reported by name to Inventory.  Inven-
                 tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

              NotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that aren't ap-
                 plicable for the managed node and therefore aren't  installed
                 on  the  node.  This  number  may be truncated if the list of
                 patch names is very large. The number of patches beyond  this
                 limit are reported in UnreportedNotApplicableCount .

              OperationStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  the  most recent patching operation was started on
                 the managed node.

              OperationEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the most recent patching operation completed on  the
                 managed node.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of patching operation that was performed: or

                 o SCAN assesses the patch compliance state.

                 o INSTALL installs missing patches.

              LastNoRebootInstallOperationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time  of the last attempt to patch the managed node with
                 NoReboot specified as the reboot option.

              RebootOption -> (string)
                 Indicates the reboot option specified in the patch baseline.

                 NOTE:
                     Reboot options apply to Install operations only.  Reboots
                     aren't attempted for Patch Manager Scan operations.

                 o RebootIfNeeded  : Patch Manager tries to reboot the managed
                   node if it installed any patches, or if any patches are de-
                   tected with a status of InstalledPendingReboot .

                 o NoReboot  : Patch Manager attempts to install missing pack-
                   ages without trying to reboot the system. Patches installed
                   with  this option are assigned a status of InstalledPendin-
                   gReboot . These patches might not be in effect until a  re-
                   boot is performed.

              CriticalNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of managed nodes where patches that are specified
                 as Critical for compliance reporting in  the  patch  baseline
                 aren't installed. These patches might be missing, have failed
                 installation, were rejected, or were installed but awaiting a
                 required  managed  node  reboot.  The status of these managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

              SecurityNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of managed nodes where patches that are  specified
                 as  Security  in  a  patch  advisory  aren't installed. These
                 patches might be missing, have failed installation, were  re-
                 jected,  or  were  installed  but awaiting a required managed
                 node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
                 ANT .

              OtherNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that are
                 specified as other than Critical or Security but aren't  com-
                 pliant  with  the patch baseline. The status of these managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
