NAME
       describe-patch-group-state -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  high-level aggregated patch compliance state information for a
       patch group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-patch-group-state
          --patch-group <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --patch-group (string)
          The name of the patch group  whose  patch  snapshot  should  be  re-
          trieved.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get the state of a patch group

       The   following   describe-patch-group-state   example   retrieves  the
       high-level patch compliance summary for a patch group.

          aws ssm describe-patch-group-state \
              --patch-group "Production"

       Output:

          {
              "Instances": 21,
              "InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithFailedPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPatches": 21,
              "InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches": 2,
              "InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches": 1,
              "InstancesWithMissingPatches": 3,
              "InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches": 4,
              "InstancesWithOtherNonCompliantPatches": 1,

              "InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches": 2
          }

OUTPUT
       Instances -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes in the patch group.

       InstancesWithInstalledPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with installed patches.

       InstancesWithInstalledOtherPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that aren't de-
          fined in the patch baseline.

       InstancesWithInstalledPendingRebootPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed by Patch  Manager
          that  haven't been rebooted after the patch installation. The status
          of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithInstalledRejectedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches installed that  are  speci-
          fied  in  a  RejectedPatches  list.  Patches  with  a  status of IN-
          STALLED_REJECTED were typically installed before they were added  to
          a RejectedPatches list.

          NOTE:
              If  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the  specified option for Rejected-
              PatchesAction ,  the  value  of  InstancesWithInstalledRejected-
              Patches will always be 0 (zero).

       InstancesWithMissingPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  with missing patches from the patch
          baseline.

       InstancesWithFailedPatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches  from  the  patch  baseline
          that failed to install.

       InstancesWithNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The number of managed nodes with patches that aren't applicable.

       InstancesWithUnreportedNotApplicablePatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed nodes with NotApplicable patches beyond the
          supported limit, which aren't reported by name to Inventory.  Inven-
          tory is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       InstancesWithCriticalNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of  managed  nodes  where patches that are specified as
          Critical for compliance reporting in the patch baseline  aren't  in-
          stalled.  These  patches might be missing, have failed installation,
          were rejected, or were installed but  awaiting  a  required  managed
          node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithSecurityNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number of managed nodes where patches that are specified as Se-
          curity in a patch advisory aren't installed. These patches might  be
          missing,  have failed installation, were rejected, or were installed
          but awaiting a required managed node reboot.  The  status  of  these
          managed nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       InstancesWithOtherNonCompliantPatches -> (integer)
          The  number  of managed nodes with patches installed that are speci-
          fied as other than Critical or Security but  aren't  compliant  with
          the patch baseline. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
          ANT .
