NAME
       get-maintenance-window-execution-task -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details  about a specific task run as part of a mainte-
       nance window execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-maintenance-window-execution-task
          --window-execution-id <value>
          --task-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window execution that includes the task.

       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the specific task execution in the maintenance window task
          that should be retrieved.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about a maintenance window task execution

       The following get-maintenance-window-execution-task example  lists  in-
       formation about a task that is part of the specified maintenance window
       execution.

          aws ssm get-maintenance-window-execution-task \
              --window-execution-id "518d5565-5969-4cca-8f0e-da3b2EXAMPLE" \
