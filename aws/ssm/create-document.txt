NAME
       create-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  Amazon  Web Services Systems Manager (SSM document). An SSM
       document defines the actions that Systems Manager performs on your man-
       aged  nodes. For more information about SSM documents, including infor-
       mation about supported schemas, features, and syntax,  see  Amazon  Web
       Services  Systems  Manager Documents in the Amazon Web Services Systems
       Manager User Guide .

OPTIONS
       --content (string)
          The content for the new SSM document in JSON  or  YAML  format.  The
          content  of  the  document must not exceed 64KB. This quota also in-
          cludes the content specified for input  parameters  at  runtime.  We
          recommend  storing the contents for your new document in an external
          JSON or YAML file and referencing the file in a command.

          For examples, see the following topics in the  Amazon  Web  Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          o Create an SSM document (console)

          o Create an SSM document (command line)

          o Create an SSM document (API)

       --requires (list)
          A  list  of  SSM documents required by a document. This parameter is
          used exclusively by AppConfig. When a user creates an AppConfig con-
          figuration in an SSM document, the user must also specify a required
          document for validation purposes. In this case,  an  ApplicationCon-
          figuration document requires an ApplicationConfigurationSchema docu-
          ment for validation purposes. For more information, see What is App-
          Config? in the AppConfig User Guide .

          (structure)
              An SSM document required by the current document.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the  required SSM document. The name can be an
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

              Version -> (string)
                 The document version required by the current document.

              RequireType -> (string)
                 The document type of the required SSM document.

              VersionName -> (string)
                 An optional field specifying the version of the artifact  as-
                 sociated  with the document. For example, 12.6. This value is
                 unique across all  versions  of  a  document,  and  can't  be
                 changed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Version=string,RequireType=string,VersionName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string",
              "RequireType": "string",
              "VersionName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --attachments (list)
          A  list of key-value pairs that describe attachments to a version of
          a document.

          (structure)
              Identifying information about a document  attachment,  including
              the  file name and a key-value pair that identifies the location
              of an attachment to a document.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a key-value pair that identifies the  location  of
                 an attachment to a document.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value of a key-value pair that identifies the location of
                 an attachment to a document. The format for Value depends  on
                 the type of key you specify.

                 o For the key SourceUrl , the value is an S3 bucket location.
                   For example:  "Values": [ "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-pre-
                   fix" ]

                 o For  the  key  S3FileUrl  ,  the  value  is a file in an S3
                   bucket.       For       example:         "Values":        [
                   "s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/my-prefix/my-file.py" ]

                 o For  the key AttachmentReference , the value is constructed
                   from the name of another SSM document in  your  account,  a
                   version  number  of  that  document, and a file attached to
                   that document version that you want to reuse. For  example:
                   "Values":  [  "MyOtherDocument/3/my-other-file.py" ]   How-
                   ever, if the SSM document is shared with you  from  another
                   account,  the  full  SSM document ARN must be specified in-
                   stead of the document name only. For example:  "Values":  [
                   "arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:111122223333:document/OtherAccount-
                   Document/3/their-file.py" ]

                 (string)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the document attachment file.

          [
            {
              "Key": "SourceUrl"|"S3FileUrl"|"AttachmentReference",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Name": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --name (string)
          A name for the SSM document.

          WARNING:
              You can't use the following strings as document  name  prefixes.
              These  are  reserved  by Amazon Web Services for use as document
              name prefixes:

              o aws

              o amazon

              o amzn

              o AWSEC2

              o AWSConfigRemediation

              o AWSSupport

       --display-name (string)
          An optional field where you can specify a friendly name for the  SSM
          document.  This  value  can differ for each version of the document.
          You can update this value at a later time using the   UpdateDocument
          operation.

       --version-name (string)
          An  optional  field  specifying  the version of the artifact you are
          creating with the document. For example, Release12.1 . This value is
          unique across all versions of a document, and can't be changed.

       --document-type (string)
          The type of document to create.

          NOTE:
              The  DeploymentStrategy  document  type  is an internal-use-only
              document type reserved for AppConfig.

          Possible values:

          o Command

          o Policy

          o Automation

          o Session

          o Package

          o ApplicationConfiguration

          o ApplicationConfigurationSchema

          o ProblemAnalysis

          o ProblemAnalysisTemplate

          o CloudFormation

          o ConformancePackTemplate

          o QuickSetup

       --document-format (string)
          Specify the document format for the request. The document format can
          be JSON, YAML, or TEXT. JSON is the default format.

          Possible values:

          o YAML

          o JSON

          o TEXT

       --target-type (string)
          Specify  a target type to define the kinds of resources the document
          can run on. For example, to run a document on EC2 instances, specify
          the following value: /AWS::EC2::Instance . If you specify a value of
          '/' the document can run on all types of  resources.  If  you  don't
          specify a value, the document can't run on any resources. For a list
          of valid resource types, see Amazon Web Services resource and  prop-
          erty types reference in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you to
          categorize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose,  owner,
          or  environment.  For example, you might want to tag an SSM document
          to identify the types of targets or the environment  where  it  will
          run. In this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=OS,Value=Windows

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          NOTE:
              To  add  tags to an existing SSM document, use the  AddTagsToRe-
              source operation.

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
