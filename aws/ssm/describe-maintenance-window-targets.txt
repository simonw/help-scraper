NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the targets registered with the maintenance window.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-targets  is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Targets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-targets
          --window-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window whose targets should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional filters that can be used to narrow down the  scope  of  the
          returned  window  targets. The supported filter keys are Type , Win-
          dowTargetId , and OwnerInformation .

          (structure)
              Filter used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on  the
              API  operation that includes the filter. API operations that use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list all targets for a maintenance window matching a spe-
       cific owner information value

       This describe-maintenance-window-targets example lists all of the  tar-
       gets for a maintenance window with a specific value.

          aws ssm describe-maintenance-window-targets \
              --window-id "mw-0ecb1226ddEXAMPLE" \
              --filters "Key=OwnerInformation,Values=CostCenter1"

       Output:

                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One or more targets must be specified for  maintenance
                        window  Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types  (Automation,  Lambda,  and Step Functions). For
                        more information about running tasks that don't  spec-

                     o Maintenance   window    targets    only    :    Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=<re-
                       source-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                     o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                       source-group-name>

                     For example:

                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                     o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,Cost-
                       Center3

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This  example  demonstrates how to target all resources
                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              OwnerInformation -> (string)
                 A user-provided value that will be  included  in  any  Amazon
                 CloudWatch  Events events that are raised while running tasks
                 for these targets in this maintenance window.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name for the maintenance window target.

              Description -> (string)
                 A description for the target.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
