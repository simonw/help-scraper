UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()                        UPDATE-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()



NAME
       update-resource-data-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Update  a resource data sync. After you create a resource data sync for
       a Region, you can't change the account options for that sync. For exam-
       ple, if you create a sync in the us-east-2 (Ohio) Region and you choose
       the Include only the current account option, you can't edit  that  sync
       later and choose the Include all accounts from my Organizations config-
       uration option. Instead, you must delete the first resource data  sync,
       and create a new one.

       NOTE:
          This  API operation only supports a resource data sync that was cre-
          ated with a SyncFromSource SyncType .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-resource-data-sync
          --sync-name <value>
          --sync-type <value>
          --sync-source <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sync-name (string)
          The name of the resource data sync you want to update.

       --sync-type (string)
          The type of resource data sync. The supported SyncType is  SyncFrom-
          Source.

       --sync-source (structure)
          Specify information about the data sources to synchronize.

          SourceType -> (string)
              The  type  of data source for the resource data sync. SourceType
              is either AwsOrganizations (if an organization is present in Or-
              ganizations) or SingleAccountMultiRegions .

          AwsOrganizationsSource -> (structure)
              Information  about the AwsOrganizationsSource resource data sync
              source. A sync source of this type can synchronize data from Or-
              ganizations.

              OrganizationSourceType -> (string)
                 If  an  Amazon  Web Services organization is present, this is
                 either OrganizationalUnits or EntireOrganization . For  Orga-
                 nizationalUnits  , the data is aggregated from a set of orga-
                 nization units. For EntireOrganization , the data  is  aggre-
                 gated from the entire Amazon Web Services organization.

              OrganizationalUnits -> (list)
                 The Organizations organization units included in the sync.

                 (structure)
                     The Organizations organizational unit data source for the
                     sync.

                     OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                        The Organizations unit ID data source for the sync.

          SourceRegions -> (list)
              The SyncSource Amazon Web Services Regions included in  the  re-
              source data sync.

              (string)

          IncludeFutureRegions -> (boolean)
              Whether to automatically synchronize and aggregate data from new
              Amazon Web Services Regions when those Regions come online.

          EnableAllOpsDataSources -> (boolean)
              When you create a resource data sync, if you choose one  of  the
              Organizations  options,  then  Systems Manager automatically en-
              ables all OpsData sources in the selected  Amazon  Web  Services
              Regions  for  all Amazon Web Services accounts in your organiza-
              tion (or in the selected organization units). For more  informa-
              tion,  see About multiple account and Region resource data syncs
              in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SourceType": "string",
            "AwsOrganizationsSource": {
              "OrganizationSourceType": "string",
              "OrganizationalUnits": [
                {
                  "OrganizationalUnitId": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            },
            "SourceRegions": ["string", ...],
            "IncludeFutureRegions": true|false,
            "EnableAllOpsDataSources": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To update a resource data sync

       The following update-resource-data-sync  example  updates  a  SyncFrom-
       Source resource data sync.

          aws ssm update-resource-data-sync \
              --sync-name exampleSync \
              --sync-type SyncFromSource \
              --sync-source '{"SourceType":"SingleAccountMultiRegions", "SourceRegions":["us-east-1", "us-west-2"]}'

       This command produces no output.

OUTPUT
       None
