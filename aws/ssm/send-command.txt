OPTIONS
       --instance-ids (list)
          The  IDs of the managed nodes where the command should run. Specify-
          ing managed node IDs is most useful when you are targeting a limited
          number of managed nodes, though you can specify up to 50 IDs.

          To  target a larger number of managed nodes, or if you prefer not to
          list individual node IDs, we recommend using the Targets option  in-
          stead. Using Targets , which accepts tag key-value pairs to identify
          the managed nodes to send commands to, you can  a  send  command  to
          tens, hundreds, or thousands of nodes at once.

          For more information about how to use targets, see Using targets and
          rate controls to send commands to a fleet in the Amazon Web Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --targets (list)
          An  array  of  search  criteria  that  targets managed nodes using a
          Key,Value combination that you specify. Specifying targets  is  most
          useful  when you want to send a command to a large number of managed
          nodes at once. Using Targets , which accepts tag key-value pairs  to
          identify managed nodes, you can send a command to tens, hundreds, or
          thousands of nodes at once.

          To send a command to a smaller number of managed nodes, you can  use
          the InstanceIds option instead.

          For  more information about how to use targets, see Sending commands
          to a fleet in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<in-
                stance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run Command and Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation  targets   only   :   Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                source-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run Command and Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This exam-
                ple demonstrates how to target all resources in  the  resource
                group ProductionResourceGroup in your maintenance window.

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                This  example  demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic
                Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your  mainte-
                nance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --document-name (string)
          The  name  of  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM
          document) to run. This can be a public document or  a  custom  docu-
          ment. To run a shared document belonging to another account, specify
          the document Amazon Resource Name (ARN). For more information  about
          how  to  use shared documents, see Using shared SSM documents in the
          Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          NOTE:
              If you specify a document name or ARN that  hasn't  been  shared
              with your account, you receive an InvalidDocument error.

       --document-version (string)
          The SSM document version to use in the request. You can specify $DE-
          FAULT, $LATEST, or a specific version number. If you run commands by
          using the Command Line Interface (Amazon Web Services CLI), then you
          must escape the first two options by using a backslash. If you spec-
          ify  a version number, then you don't need to use the backslash. For
          example: -- document-version "$DEFAULT"
          --document-version "$LATEST" -- document-version "3"

       --document-hash (string)
          The Sha256 or Sha1 hash created by the system when the document  was
          created.

              Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.

       --document-hash-type (string)
          Sha256 or Sha1.

          NOTE:
              Sha1 hashes have been deprecated.

          Possible values:

          o Sha256

          o Sha1

       --timeout-seconds (integer)
          If  this time is reached and the command hasn't already started run-
          ning, it won't run.

       --comment (string)
          User-specified information about the command, such as  a  brief  de-
          scription of what the command should do.

       --parameters (map)
          The required and optional parameters specified in the document being
          run.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --output-s3-region (string)
          (Deprecated) You can no longer specify this  parameter.  The  system
          ignores  it.  Instead,  Systems Manager automatically determines the
          Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

       --output-s3-bucket-name (string)
          The name of the S3 bucket where command execution  responses  should
          be stored.

       --output-s3-key-prefix (string)
          The  directory  structure  within  the S3 bucket where the responses
          should be stored.

       --max-concurrency (string)
          (Optional) The maximum number of managed nodes that are  allowed  to
          run  the  command at the same time. You can specify a number such as
          10 or a percentage such as 10%. The default value is 50 .  For  more
          information  about how to use MaxConcurrency , see Using concurrency
          controls in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       --max-errors (string)
          The maximum number of errors allowed without  the  command  failing.
          When the command fails one more time beyond the value of MaxErrors ,
          the systems stops sending the command to additional targets. You can
          specify a number like 10 or a percentage like 10%. The default value
          is 0 . For more information about how to use MaxErrors ,  see  Using
          error controls in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
          .

       --service-role-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service role  to
          use to publish Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) noti-
          fications for Run Command commands.

       --notification-config (structure)
          Configurations for sending notifications.

          NotificationArn -> (string)
              An Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for an Amazon Simple  Notification
              Service  (Amazon  SNS)  topic.  Run Command pushes notifications
              about command status changes to this topic.

          NotificationEvents -> (list)
              The different events for which you can receive notifications. To
              learn  more  about  these events, see Monitoring Systems Manager
              status changes using Amazon SNS notifications in the Amazon  Web
              Services Systems Manager User Guide .

              (string)

          NotificationType -> (string)
              The type of notification.

              o Command  :  Receive  notification when the status of a command
                changes.

              o Invocation : For commands sent to multiple managed nodes,  re-
                ceive  notification  on  a per-node basis when the status of a
                command changes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationArn=string,NotificationEvents=string,string,NotificationType=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationArn": "string",
            "NotificationEvents": ["All"|"InProgress"|"Success"|"TimedOut"|"Cancelled"|"Failed", ...],
            "NotificationType": "Command"|"Invocation"
          }

       --cloud-watch-output-config (structure)
          Enables Amazon Web Services Systems Manager to send Run Command out-
          put to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Run Command is a capability of Amazon
          Web Services Systems Manager.

          CloudWatchLogGroupName -> (string)
              The name of the CloudWatch Logs log group where you want to send
              command  output.  If  you don't specify a group name, Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager automatically creates a log  group  for
              you. The log group uses the following naming format:

                 ``
                 aws/ssm/SystemsManagerDocumentName ``

          CloudWatchOutputEnabled -> (boolean)
              Enables  Systems  Manager  to  send command output to CloudWatch
              Logs.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CloudWatchLogGroupName=string,CloudWatchOutputEnabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CloudWatchLogGroupName": "string",
            "CloudWatchOutputEnabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                   AMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                 o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCen-
                   ter3

                 o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                 o Run Command and Maintenance window targets only  :  Key=re-
                   source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup      This
                   example demonstrates how to target all resources in the re-
                   source  group  ProductionResourceGroup  in your maintenance
                   window.

                 o Maintenance window targets only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                   sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                   This example demonstrates how to target only Amazon Elastic
                   Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your main-
                   tenance window.

                 o Automation targets  only  :  Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyRe-
                   sourceGroup

                 o State   Manager  association  targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                   ceIds,Values=*   This example demonstrates  how  to  target
                   all  managed  instances  in  the Amazon Web Services Region
                   where the association was created.

                 For more information about how to send commands  that  target
                 managed  nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting mul-
                 tiple instances in the Amazon Web  Services  Systems  Manager
                 User Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     User-defined  criteria  for  sending commands that target
                     managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                 Values -> (list)
                     User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example,  if
                     you   specified   tag:ServerRole   ,  you  could  specify
                     value:WebServer to run a command on  instances  that  in-
                     clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending  on  the  type of target, the maximum number of
                     values for a key might be lower than the  global  maximum
                     of 50.

                     (string)

          RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
              The date and time the command was requested.

          Status -> (string)
              The status of the command.

          StatusDetails -> (string)
              A  detailed  status  of the command execution. StatusDetails in-
              cludes more information than Status because it  includes  states
              resulting from error and concurrency control parameters. Status-
              Details can show different results than Status. For more  infor-
              mation  about these statuses, see Understanding command statuses
              in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .  Status-
              Details can be one of the following values:

              o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

              o In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one managed
                node but hasn't reached a final state on all managed nodes.

              o Success: The command successfully ran on all invocations. This
                is a terminal state.

              o Delivery Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command in-
                vocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a ter-
                minal state.

              o Execution  Timed  Out:  The value of MaxErrors or more command
                invocations shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This  is  a
                terminal state.

              o Failed:  The  value  of  MaxErrors or more command invocations
                shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

              o Incomplete: The command was attempted on all managed nodes and
                one  or  more  invocations doesn't have a value of Success but
                not enough invocations failed for the  status  to  be  Failed.
                This is a terminal state.

              o Cancelled: The command was terminated before it was completed.
                This is a terminal state.

              o Rate Exceeded: The number of managed  nodes  targeted  by  the
                command  exceeded  the  account limit for pending invocations.
                The system has canceled the command before running it  on  any
                managed node. This is a terminal state.

          OutputS3Region -> (string)
              (Deprecated)  You can no longer specify this parameter. The sys-
              tem ignores it. Instead, Systems  Manager  automatically  deter-

          MaxConcurrency -> (string)
              The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed to run  the
              command  at  the  same time. You can specify a number of managed
              nodes, such as 10, or a percentage of nodes, such  as  10%.  The
              default  value is 50. For more information about how to use Max-
              Concurrency , see Running commands  using  Systems  Manager  Run
              Command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          MaxErrors -> (string)
              The  maximum  number  of  errors allowed before the system stops
              sending the command to additional targets.  You  can  specify  a
              number of errors, such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such as
              10%. The default value is 0 . For more information about how  to
              use  MaxErrors  , see Running commands using Systems Manager Run
