LIST-DOCUMENTS()                                              LIST-DOCUMENTS()



NAME
       list-documents -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  Systems Manager (SSM) documents in the current Amazon Web
       Services account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can limit the  re-
       sults of this request by using a filter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-documents  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: DocumentIdentifiers

SYNOPSIS
            list-documents
          [--document-filter-list <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-filter-list (list)
          This data type is deprecated. Instead, use Filters .

          (structure)
              This data type is deprecated. Instead,  use   DocumentKeyValues-
              Filter .

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              value -> (string)
                 The value of the filter.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "Name"|"Owner"|"PlatformTypes"|"DocumentType",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          One  or more DocumentKeyValuesFilter objects. Use a filter to return
          a more specific list of results. For keys, you can  specify  one  or
          more key-value pair tags that have been applied to a document. Other
          valid keys include Owner , Name , PlatformTypes , DocumentType , and
          TargetType   .   For  example,  to  return  documents  you  own  use
          Key=Owner,Values=Self . To specify a custom key-value pair, use  the
          format Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName .

          NOTE:
              This  API operation only supports filtering documents by using a
              single tag  key  and  one  or  more  tag  values.  For  example:
              Key=tag:tagName,Values=valueName1,valueName2

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of documents.

              For keys, you can specify one or more tags that  have  been  ap-
              plied to a document.

              You  can  also  use  Amazon  Web Services-provided keys, some of
              which have specific allowed values. These keys and their associ-
              ated values are as follows:
                 DocumentType

              o ApplicationConfiguration

              o ApplicationConfigurationSchema

              o Automation

              o ChangeCalendar

              o Command

              o DeploymentStrategy

              o Package

              o Policy

              o Session

                Owner

              Note  that only one Owner can be specified in a request. For ex-
              ample: Key=Owner,Values=Self .

              o Amazon

              o Private

              o Public

              o Self

              o ThirdParty

                PlatformTypes

              o Linux

              o Windows
                 Name is another Amazon Web Services-provided key. If you  use
                 Name  as a key, you can use a name prefix to return a list of
                 documents. For example, in the Amazon Web  Services  CLI,  to
                 return  a  list of all documents that begin with Te , run the
                 following command:

                 aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=Name,Values=Te

              You can also use the  TargetType  Amazon  Web  Services-provided
              key.  For  a list of valid resource type values that can be used
              with this key, see Amazon Web  Services  resource  and  property
              types reference in the CloudFormation User Guide .

              If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are iden-
              tified by all the tags are returned in the results. If you spec-
              ify  more  than two values for a key, documents that are identi-
              fied by any of the values are returned in the results.

              To specify a custom key-value pair, use the format  Key=tag:tag-
              Name,Values=valueName .

              For  example,  if  you created a key called region and are using
              the Amazon Web Services CLI to call the list-documents command:
                 aws   ssm   list-documents   --filters    Key=tag:region,Val-
                 ues=east,west Key=Owner,Values=Self

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
