          A  key-value  mapping  to  target resources. Required if you specify
          TargetParameterName.

          (structure)
              An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes  using  a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance window
                 Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,  targets  are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda, and Step Functions). For more information about  run-
                 ning  tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering main-
                 tenance window tasks without targets in the Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<in-
                stance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run Command and Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation  targets   only   :   Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                source-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run Command and Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This exam-
                ple demonstrates how to target all resources in  the  resource
                group ProductionResourceGroup in your maintenance window.

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                This  example  demonstrates  how to target only Amazon Elastic
                Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your  mainte-
                nance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State Manager association targets only :  Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target all managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged nodes using Key,Value parameters,  see  Targeting  multiple
              instances  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined criteria for sending commands that  target  man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if you
                 specified tag:ServerRole , you could specify  value:WebServer
                 to  run  a  command  on  instances  that  include EC2 tags of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --target-maps (list)
          A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
          Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {"string": ["string", ...]
              ...}
            ...
          ]

       --max-concurrency (string)
          The maximum number of targets allowed to run this task in  parallel.
          You  can specify a number, such as 10, or a percentage, such as 10%.
          The default value is 10 .

       --max-errors (string)
          The number of errors that are allowed before the system  stops  run-
          ning the automation on additional targets. You can specify either an
          absolute number of errors, for example 10, or a  percentage  of  the
          target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for example, the sys-
          tem stops running the automation when the fourth error is  received.
          If  you  specify  0, then the system stops running the automation on
          additional targets after the first error result is returned. If  you
          run  an  automation  on 50 resources and set max-errors to 10%, then
          the system stops running the automation on additional  targets  when
          the sixth error is received.

          Executions that are already running an automation when max-errors is
          reached are allowed to complete, but some of  these  executions  may
          fail  as  well.  If you need to ensure that there won't be more than
          max-errors failed executions, set max-concurrency to 1 so the execu-
          tions proceed one at a time.

       --target-locations (list)
          A  location  is  a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and/or
          Amazon Web Services accounts where you want to run  the  automation.
          Use  this  operation  to  start an automation in multiple Amazon Web
          Services Regions and multiple Amazon Web Services accounts. For more
          information, see Running Automation workflows in multiple Amazon Web
          Services Regions and Amazon Web Services accounts in the Amazon  Web
          Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          (structure)

                 rently.

              TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                 The maximum number of errors allowed before the system  stops
                 queueing  additional  Automation executions for the currently
                 running Automation.

              ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                 The Automation execution role used by the  currently  running

                 automation or command.

                 IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)
                     When this value is true , your automation or command con-
                     tinues to run in cases where we cant retrieve alarm  sta-
                     tus  information  from CloudWatch. In cases where we suc-
                     cessfully retrieve an alarm  status  of  OK  or  INSUFFI-
                     CIENT_DATA,  the  automation or command continues to run,
                     regardless of this value. Default is false .

                 Alarms -> (list)
                     The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the config-
                     uration.

            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. You can  specify  a
          maximum  of  five tags for an automation. Tags enable you to catego-
          rize a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or en-
          vironment. For example, you might want to tag an automation to iden-
          tify an environment or operating system. In  this  case,  you  could
          specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=environment,Value=test

          o Key=OS,Value=Windows

          NOTE:
              To  add  tags  to  an existing automation, use the  AddTagsToRe-
              source operation.

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

            ...
          ]

       --alarm-configuration (structure)
          The CloudWatch alarm you want to apply to your automation.

          IgnorePollAlarmFailure -> (boolean)
              When  this  value is true , your automation or command continues
              to run in cases where we cant retrieve alarm status  information
              from  CloudWatch.  In  cases  where  we successfully retrieve an
              alarm status of OK or INSUFFICIENT_DATA, the automation or  com-
              mand  continues  to  run,  regardless  of this value. Default is
              false .

          Alarms -> (list)
              The name of the CloudWatch alarm specified in the configuration.

              (structure)
                 A CloudWatch alarm you apply to an automation or command.

                 Name -> (string)

            ]
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To execute an automation document

       The following start-automation-execution  example  runs  an  Automation
       document.

          aws ssm start-automation-execution \
              --document-name "AWS-UpdateLinuxAmi" \
              --parameters "AutomationAssumeRole=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SSMAutomationRole,SourceAmiId=ami-EXAMPLE,IamInstanceProfileName=EC2InstanceRole"

       Output:

          {
