RESUME-SESSION()                                              RESUME-SESSION()



NAME
       resume-session -

DESCRIPTION
       Reconnects  a session to a managed node after it has been disconnected.
       Connections can be resumed for disconnected sessions,  but  not  termi-
       nated sessions.

       NOTE:
          This  command  is  primarily for use by client machines to automati-
          cally reconnect during intermittent network  issues.  It  isn't  in-
          tended for any other use.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            resume-session
          --session-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --session-id (string)
          The ID of the disconnected session to resume.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       This resume-session example resumes a Session Manager session  with  an
       instance  after  it  has  been disconnected. Note that this interactive
       command requires the Session Manager plugin  to  be  installed  on  the
       client machine making the call.

          aws ssm resume-session \
              --session-id Mary-Major-07a16060613c408b5
