NAME
       describe-automation-step-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Information about all active and terminated step executions in an Auto-
       mation workflow.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-automation-step-executions is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: StepExecutions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-automation-step-executions
          --automation-execution-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--reverse-order | --no-reverse-order]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --automation-execution-id (string)
          The  Automation  execution  ID for which you want step execution de-
          scriptions.

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters to limit the number of step executions  returned
          by the request.

          (structure)
              A  filter  to limit the amount of step execution information re-
              turned by the call.

              Key -> (string)
                 One or more keys to limit the results. Valid filter keys  in-
                 clude  the following: StepName, Action, StepExecutionId, Ste-
                 pExecutionStatus, StartTimeBefore, StartTimeAfter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of the filter key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "StartTimeBefore"|"StartTimeAfter"|"StepExecutionStatus"|"StepExecutionId"|"StepName"|"Action",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --reverse-order | --no-reverse-order (boolean)
          Indicates whether to list step executions in reverse order by  start
          time. The default value is 'false'.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          an execution.

              tion step.

                 If a step failed, this message  explains  why  the  execution
                 failed.

                 Information about the Automation failure.

                 FailureStage -> (string)
                     The  stage  of  the Automation execution when the failure
                     occurred. The stages include the following:  InputValida-

                     Internal.

                 Details -> (map)
                     Detailed information about the Automation step failure.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (list)

                 The unique ID of a step execution.

              OverriddenParameters -> (map)

                 whether the step succeeds or fails.

              NextStep -> (string)
                 The next step after the step succeeds.

              IsCritical -> (boolean)
                 The flag which can be used to help decide whether the failure
                 of current step leads to the Automation failure.

              ValidNextSteps -> (list)
                 Strategies used when step  fails,  we  support  Continue  and
                 Abort.  Abort  will  fail the automation when the step fails.
                 Continue will ignore the failure of current  step  and  allow
                 automation  to run the next step. With conditional branching,
                 we add step:stepName to support the automation to go  to  an-
                 other specific step.

                 (string)

              Targets -> (list)
                 The targets for the step execution.

                 (structure)
                     An  array  of  search criteria that targets managed nodes
                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One or more targets must be specified for  maintenance
                        window  Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types  (Automation,  Lambda,  and Step Functions). For
                        more information about running tasks that don't  spec-
                        ify  targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks

                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                     (string)

                 TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                     The maximum number of Amazon  Web  Services  Regions  and
                     Amazon  Web  Services accounts allowed to run the Automa-
                     tion concurrently.

                 TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                     The maximum number of errors allowed  before  the  system
                     stops  queueing  additional Automation executions for the
                     currently running Automation.

                     The Automation execution role used by the currently  run-
                     ning  Automation.  If not specified, the default value is
                     AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .
