LIST-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()                            LIST-RESOURCE-DATA-SYNC()



NAME
       list-resource-data-sync -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  your  resource  data  sync  configurations. Includes information
       about the last time a sync attempted to start, the  last  sync  status,
       and the last time a sync successfully completed.

       The  number of sync configurations might be too large to return using a
       single call to ListResourceDataSync . You can limit the number of  sync
       configurations returned by using the MaxResults parameter. To determine
       whether there are more sync configurations to list, check the value  of
       NextToken in the output. If there are more sync configurations to list,
       you can request them by specifying the NextToken returned in  the  call
       to the parameter of a subsequent call.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-resource-data-sync  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ResourceDataSyncItems

SYNOPSIS
            list-resource-data-sync
          [--sync-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sync-type (string)
          View a list of resource data syncs according to the sync type. Spec-
          ify  SyncToDestination  to view resource data syncs that synchronize
          data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Specify SyncFromSource to view resource
          data  syncs  from Organizations or from multiple Amazon Web Services
          Regions.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceDataSyncItems -> (list)

          statuses.

          (structure)
              Information  about a resource data sync configuration, including

                 tion , then the resource data sync synchronizes data to an S3
                 bucket. If the SyncType is SyncFromSource then  the  resource
                 data sync synchronizes data from Organizations or from multi-

                        tion . For OrganizationalUnits , the  data  is  aggre-
                        gated  from a set of organization units. For EntireOr-
                        ganization , the data is aggregated  from  the  entire
