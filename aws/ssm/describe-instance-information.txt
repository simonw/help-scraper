NAME
       describe-instance-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  one  or  more  of  your managed nodes, including information
       about the operating system platform, the version of SSM Agent installed
       on the managed node, node status, and so on.

       If you specify one or more managed node IDs, it returns information for
       those managed nodes. If you don't specify node IDs, it returns informa-
       tion  for  all  your managed nodes. If you specify a node ID that isn't
       valid or a node that you don't own, you receive an error.

       NOTE:
          The IamRole field for this API operation is the Identity and  Access
          Management  (IAM)  role  assigned to on-premises managed nodes. This
          call doesn't return the IAM role for EC2 instances.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-information is a paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: InstanceInformationList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-information
          [--instance-information-filter-list <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-information-filter-list (list)
          This  is  a  legacy  method.  We  recommend  that you don't use this
          method. Instead, use the Filters data type. Filters enables  you  to
          return  node  information by filtering based on tags applied to man-
          aged nodes.

          NOTE:
              Attempting  to  use  InstanceInformationFilterList  and  Filters
              leads to an exception error.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for a specific list of managed nodes. You can
              filter node information by using tags. You specify tags by using
              a key-value mapping.

              Use  this operation instead of the  DescribeInstanceInformation-
              Request$InstanceInformationFilterList method. The InstanceInfor-
              mationFilterList  method  is a legacy method and doesn't support
              tags.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              valueSet -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,valueSet=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"PlatformTypes"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"AssociationStatus",
              "valueSet": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list  of
          managed  nodes.  You  can  filter  based  on tags applied to EC2 in-
          stances. Use this Filters data type instead of  InstanceInformation-
          FilterList , which is deprecated.

          (structure)
              The  filters  to  describe or get information about your managed
              nodes.

              Key -> (string)
                 The filter key name to describe your managed nodes. For exam-
                 ple:

                 "InstanceIds"|"AgentVersion"|"PingStatus"|"Platform-
                 Types"|"ActivationIds"|"IamRole"|"ResourceType"|"Association-
                 Status"|"Tag Key"

                 WARNING:
                     Tag  key  isn't  a  valid filter. You must specify either
                     tag-key or tag:keyname and a string. Here are some  valid
                     examples:  tag-key,  tag:123,  tag:al!, tag:Windows. Here
                     are some  invalid  examples:  tag-keys,  Tag  Key,  tag:,
                     tagKey, abc:keyname.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 whether  or  not  the  latest version is installed on Windows
                 managed nodes, because some older versions of Windows  Server
                 use  the  EC2Config  service  to  process Systems Manager re-
                 quests.

              PlatformType -> (string)
                 The operating system platform type.

                 ager when the server or virtual machine (VM) was registered.

              IamRole -> (string)
                 The Identity and Access Management (IAM) role assigned to the
                 on-premises  Systems  Manager managed node. This call doesn't
                 return the IAM role for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon
                 EC2) instances. To retrieve the IAM role for an EC2 instance,
                 use the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For  informa-
                 tion,  see  DescribeInstances in the Amazon EC2 API Reference
                 or describe-instances in the Amazon Web Services CLI  Command
                 Reference .

              RegistrationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the server or VM was registered with Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices as a managed node.

                 virtual machine (VM) when it is activated as a  Systems  Man-
                 ager  managed  node.  The name is specified as the DefaultIn-
                 stanceName property using the  CreateActivation  command.  It
                 is  applied  to the managed node by specifying the Activation
                 Code and Activation ID when you  install  SSM  Agent  on  the
                 node, as explained in Install SSM Agent for a hybrid environ-
                 ment (Linux) and Install SSM Agent for a  hybrid  environment
                 (Windows)  . To retrieve the Name tag of an EC2 instance, use
                 the Amazon EC2 DescribeInstances operation. For  information,
                 see  DescribeInstances  in  the  Amazon  EC2 API Reference or

              LastSuccessfulAssociationExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The last date the association was successfully run.

              AssociationOverview -> (structure)
                 Information about the association.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)
