OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID for which you want inventory information.

       --type-name (string)
          The type of inventory item for which you want information.

       --filters (list)
          One  or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list of
          results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 Inventory filter values. Example: inventory filter where man-
                 aged node IDs are specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceInfor-
                 mation.InstanceId,Values=                     i-a12b3c4d5e6g,
                 i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal .

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The Exists filter must be used with aggregators. For more
                     information, see Aggregating inventory data in the Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"|"Exists"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --next-token (string)
          The token for the next set of items to return.  (You  received  this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of items to return for this call. The call also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To view specific inventory type entries for an instance

       This  following  list-inventory-entries example lists the inventory en-
       tries for the AWS:Application inventory type on a specific instance.

          aws ssm list-inventory-entries \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --type-name "AWS:Application"

       Output:

          {
            "TypeName": "AWS:Application",
            "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
            "SchemaVersion": "1.1",
            "CaptureTime": "2019-02-15T12:17:55Z",
            "Entries": [
              {
                "Architecture": "i386",
                "Name": "Amazon SSM Agent",
                "PackageId": "{88a60be2-89a1-4df8-812a-80863c2a2b68}",
                "Publisher": "Amazon Web Services",
                "Version": "2.3.274.0"
              },
              {
                "Architecture": "x86_64",
                "InstalledTime": "2018-05-03T13:42:34Z",
                "Name": "AmazonCloudWatchAgent",
                "Publisher": "",
                "Version": "1.200442.0"
              }
            ]
          }

       Example 2: To view custom inventory entries assigned to an instance

       The following list-inventory-entries example lists a  custom  inventory
       entry assigned to an instance.

          aws ssm list-inventory-entries \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --type-name "Custom:RackInfo"

       Output:

          {
            "TypeName": "Custom:RackInfo",
            "InstanceId": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
            "SchemaVersion": "1.0",
            "CaptureTime": "2021-05-22T10:01:01Z",
            "Entries": [
              {
                "RackLocation": "Bay B/Row C/Rack D/Shelf E"
              }
            ]
          }

OUTPUT
       TypeName -> (string)
          The type of inventory item returned by the request.

       InstanceId -> (string)
          The  managed  node ID targeted by the request to query inventory in-
          formation.

       SchemaVersion -> (string)
          The inventory schema version used by the managed node(s).

       CaptureTime -> (string)
          The time that inventory information was collected  for  the  managed
          node(s).

       Entries -> (list)
          A list of inventory items on the managed node(s).

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
