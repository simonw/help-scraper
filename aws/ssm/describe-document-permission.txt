NAME
       describe-document-permission -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes  the  permissions  for  a Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
       document (SSM document). If you  created  the  document,  you  are  the
       owner.  If  a document is shared, it can either be shared privately (by
       specifying a user's Amazon Web Services account ID) or publicly (All ).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-document-permission
          --name <value>
          --permission-type <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the document for which you are the owner.

       --permission-type (string)
          The permission type for the document. The  permission  type  can  be
          Share .

          Possible values:

          o Share

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of items to return for this call. The call also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To describe document permissions

       The following describe-document-permission example displays  permission
       details about a Systems Manager document that is shared publicly.

          aws ssm describe-document-permission \
              --name "Example" \
              --permission-type "Share"

       Output:

          {
              "AccountIds": [
                  "all"
              ],
              "AccountSharingInfoList": [
                  {
                      "AccountId": "all",

                  }
