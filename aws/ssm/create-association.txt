CREATE-ASSOCIATION()                                      CREATE-ASSOCIATION()



NAME
       create-association -

DESCRIPTION
       A State Manager association defines the state that you want to maintain
       on your managed nodes. For example, an  association  can  specify  that
       anti-virus  software  must  be  installed  and  running on your managed
       nodes, or that certain ports must be closed. For  static  targets,  the
       association  specifies  a  schedule for when the configuration is reap-
       plied. For dynamic targets, such as an  Amazon  Web  Services  resource
       group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a ca-
       pability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the  configura-
       tion  when  new  managed  nodes are added to the group. The association
       also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For ex-
       ample,  an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If
       the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs  it.  If  the
       software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the associa-
       tion might instruct State Manager to start the service.

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM Command document or Automation runbook that con-
          tains the configuration information for the managed node.

          You  can specify Amazon Web Services-predefined documents, documents
          you created, or a document that is shared with you from another  ac-
          count.

          For  Systems  Manager documents (SSM documents) that are shared with
          you from other Amazon Web Services accounts, you  must  specify  the
          complete SSM document ARN, in the following format:

              ``
              arn:partition :ssm:region :account-id :document/document-name ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 91)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

          For example:
              arn:aws:ssm:us-east-2:12345678912:document/My-Shared-Document

          For  Amazon  Web Services-predefined documents and SSM documents you
          created in your account, you only need to specify the document name.
          For example, AWS-ApplyPatchBaseline or My-Document .

       --document-version (string)
          The  document  version you want to associate with the target(s). Can
          be a specific version or the default version.

          WARNING:
              State Manager doesn't support running associations  that  use  a
              new  version  of  a document if that document is shared from an-
              other account. State Manager always runs the default version  of
              a  document if shared from another account, even though the Sys-
              tems Manager console shows that a new version was processed.  If
              you want to run an association using a new version of a document
              shared form another account, you must set the  document  version
              to default .

       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              InstanceId has been deprecated. To specify a managed node ID for
              an association, use the Targets parameter. Requests that include
              the  parameter  InstanceID  with  Systems Manager documents (SSM
              documents) that use schema version 2.0 or later  will  fail.  In
              addition,  if  you  use the parameter InstanceId , you can't use
              the parameters AssociationName , DocumentVersion ,  MaxErrors  ,
              MaxConcurrency , OutputLocation , or ScheduleExpression . To use
              these parameters, you must use the Targets parameter.

       --parameters (map)
          The parameters for the runtime configuration of the document.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --targets (list)
          The targets for the association. You can target managed nodes by us-
          ing  tags, Amazon Web Services resource groups, all managed nodes in
          an Amazon Web Services account, or individual managed node IDs.  You
          can  target  all  managed nodes in an Amazon Web Services account by
          specifying the InstanceIds key with a value of * . For more informa-
          tion  about  choosing  targets for an association, see Using targets
          and rate controls with State Manager associations in the Amazon  Web
          Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          (structure)
              An  array  of search criteria that targets managed nodes using a
              key-value pair that you specify.

              NOTE:
                 One or more targets must be specified for maintenance  window
                 Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task, targets are
                 optional for other maintenance window task types (Automation,
                 Lambda,  and Step Functions). For more information about run-
                 ning tasks that don't specify targets, see Registering  main-
                 tenance  window  tasks without targets in the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices Systems Manager User Guide .

              Supported formats include the following.

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<in-
                stance-id-3>

              o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Values=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

              o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

              o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=<resource-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

              o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                source-group-name>

              For example:

              o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EXAM-
                PLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

              o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCenter3

              o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

              o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=re-
                source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup   This exam-
                ple  demonstrates  how to target all resources in the resource
                group ProductionResourceGroup in your maintenance window.

              o Maintenance  window  targets  only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-
                sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                This example demonstrates how to target  only  Amazon  Elastic
                Compute  Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your mainte-
                nance window.

              o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyResource-
                Group

              o State  Manager association targets only : Key=InstanceIds,Val-
                ues=*   This example demonstrates how to  target  all  managed
                instances in the Amazon Web Services Region where the associa-
                tion was created.

              For more information about how to send commands that target man-
              aged  nodes  using  Key,Value parameters, see Targeting multiple
              instances in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User  Guide
              .

              Key -> (string)
                 User-defined  criteria  for sending commands that target man-
                 aged nodes that meet the criteria.

              Values -> (list)
                 User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For example, if  you
                 specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify value:WebServer
                 to run a command  on  instances  that  include  EC2  tags  of
                 ServerRole,WebServer .

                 Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of values
                 for a key might be lower than the global maximum of 50.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --schedule-expression (string)
          A cron expression when the association will be applied to  the  tar-
          get(s).

       --output-location (structure)
          An  Amazon  Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket where you want
          to store the output details of the request.

          S3Location -> (structure)
              An S3 bucket where you want to store the  results  of  this  re-
              quest.

              OutputS3Region -> (string)
                 The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket subfolder.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Location={OutputS3Region=string,OutputS3BucketName=string,OutputS3KeyPrefix=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Location": {
              "OutputS3Region": "string",
              "OutputS3BucketName": "string",
              "OutputS3KeyPrefix": "string"
            }
          }

       --association-name (string)
          Specify a descriptive name for the association.

       --automation-target-parameter-name (string)
          Choose  the  parameter  that  will  define  how your automation will
          branch out. This target is required for associations that use an Au-
          tomation  runbook and target resources by using rate controls. Auto-
          mation is a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager.

       --max-errors (string)
          The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops  send-
          ing  requests  to run the association on additional targets. You can
          specify either an absolute number of errors, for example  10,  or  a
          percentage of the target set, for example 10%. If you specify 3, for
          example, the system stops sending requests when the fourth error  is
          received.  If  you specify 0, then the system stops sending requests
          after the first error is returned. If you run an association  on  50
          managed nodes and set MaxError to 10%, then the system stops sending
          the request when the sixth error is received.

          Executions that are already running an association when MaxErrors is
          reached  are  allowed  to complete, but some of these executions may
          fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't  be  more  than
          max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to 1 so that execu-
          tions proceed one at a time.

       --max-concurrency (string)
          The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association at  the
          same time. You can specify a number, for example 10, or a percentage
          of the target set, for example 10%. The default value is 100%, which
          means all targets run the association at the same time.

          If  a  new  managed  node  starts and attempts to run an association
          while Systems Manager is running  MaxConcurrency  associations,  the
          association is allowed to run. During the next association interval,
          the new managed node will process its association within  the  limit
          specified for MaxConcurrency .

       --compliance-severity (string)
          The severity level to assign to the association.

          Possible values:

          o CRITICAL

          o HIGH

          o MEDIUM

          o LOW

          o UNSPECIFIED

       --sync-compliance (string)
          The mode for generating association compliance. You can specify AUTO
          or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the associa-
          tion  execution  to determine the compliance status. If the associa-
          tion execution runs successfully, then the association is  COMPLIANT
          . If the association execution doesn't run successfully, the associ-
          ation is NON-COMPLIANT .

          In MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId  as  a  parameter
          for  the  PutComplianceItems API operation. In this case, compliance
          data isn't managed by State Manager. It is managed  by  your  direct
          call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

          By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

          Possible values:

          o AUTO

          o MANUAL

       --apply-only-at-cron-interval | --no-apply-only-at-cron-interval (bool-
       ean)
          By default, when you create a new association, the  system  runs  it
          immediately  after  it is created and then according to the schedule
          you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an  association
          to  run  immediately  after you create it. This parameter isn't sup-
          ported for rate expressions.

       --calendar-names (list)
          The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  of  the  Change  Calendar
          type documents you want to gate your associations under. The associ-
          ations only run when that change calendar is open. For more informa-
          tion, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calendar .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --target-locations (list)
          A  location is a combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Ama-
          zon Web Services accounts where you want to run the association. Use
          this  action to create an association in multiple Regions and multi-
          ple accounts.

          (structure)
              The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions  and  Amazon  Web
              Services accounts targeted by the current Automation execution.

              Accounts -> (list)
                 The  Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the current Au-
                 tomation execution.

                 (string)

              Regions -> (list)
                 The Amazon Web Services Regions targeted by the current Auto-
                 mation execution.

                 (string)

              TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                 Web Services accounts allowed to run the  Automation  concur-
                 rently.

              TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                 The  maximum number of errors allowed before the system stops
                 queueing additional Automation executions for  the  currently
                 running Automation.

              ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                 The  Automation  execution role used by the currently running
                 Automation. If not specified, the default value  is  AWS-Sys-
                 temsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Accounts=string,string,Regions=string,string,TargetLocationMaxConcurrency=string,TargetLocationMaxErrors=string,ExecutionRoleName=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Accounts": ["string", ...],
              "Regions": ["string", ...],
              "TargetLocationMaxConcurrency": "string",
              "TargetLocationMaxErrors": "string",
              "ExecutionRoleName": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --schedule-offset (integer)
          Number  of  days  to wait after the scheduled day to run an associa-
          tion. For example, if you specified a cron schedule of cron(0 0 ?  *
          THU#2  *)  , you could specify an offset of 3 to run the association
          each Sunday after the second Thursday of the month. For more  infor-
          mation  about  cron  schedules for associations, see Reference: Cron
          and rate expressions for Systems Manager in the Amazon Web  Services
          Systems Manager User Guide .

          NOTE:
              To use offsets, you must specify the ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval pa-
              rameter. This option tells the system not to run an  association
              immediately after you create it.

       --target-maps (list)
          A key-value mapping of document parameters to target resources. Both
          Targets and TargetMaps can't be specified together.

          (map)
              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {"string": ["string", ...]
              ...}
            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Optional metadata that you assign to a resource. Tags enable you  to
          categorize  a resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner,
          or environment. For example, you might want to tag an association to
          identify  the type of resource to which it applies, the environment,
          or the purpose of the association.

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

                 o Run  Command  and Maintenance window targets only : Key=re-
                   source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup      This
                   example demonstrates how to target all resources in the re-
                   source group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                   window.

                 o Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=resource-groups:Re-
                   sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                   This example demonstrates how to target only Amazon Elastic
                   Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your main-
                   tenance window.

                 o Automation  targets  only  : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyRe-
                   sourceGroup

                 o State  Manager  association  targets  only  :   Key=Instan-
                   ceIds,Values=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target
                   all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
                   where the association was created.

                 For  more  information about how to send commands that target
                 managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting  mul-
                 tiple  instances  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     User-defined criteria for sending  commands  that  target
                     managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                 Values -> (list)
                     User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if
                     you  specified  tag:ServerRole  ,   you   could   specify
                     value:WebServer  to  run  a command on instances that in-
                     clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending on the type of target, the  maximum  number  of
                     values  for  a key might be lower than the global maximum
                     of 50.

              An  S3  bucket where you want to store the output details of the
              request.

              S3Location -> (structure)
                 An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this  re-
                 quest.

                 OutputS3Region -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket subfolder.

          LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the association was last run.

          LastSuccessfulExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The last date on which the association was successfully run.

          AssociationName -> (string)
              The association name.

          MaxErrors -> (string)
              The  number  of  errors that are allowed before the system stops
              sending requests to run the association on  additional  targets.
              You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example
              10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  If  you
              specify  3,  for example, the system stops sending requests when
              the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the  system
              stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you
              run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to  10%,
              then  the  system stops sending the request when the sixth error
              is received.

              Executions that are already running an association  when  MaxEr-
              rors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these exe-
              cutions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't
              be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to
              1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

          MaxConcurrency -> (string)
              The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association  at
              the  same  time.  You can specify a number, for example 10, or a
              percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value
              is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same
              time.

              If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  association
              while  Systems  Manager  is running MaxConcurrency associations,
              the association is allowed to run. During the  next  association
              interval,  the  new  managed  node  will process its association
              within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

          ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
              The severity level that is assigned to the association.

          SyncCompliance -> (string)
              The mode for generating association compliance. You can  specify
              AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the
              association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
              association execution runs successfully, then the association is
              COMPLIANT . If the association execution  doesn't  run  success-
              fully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

              In  MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parame-
              ter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this  case,
              compliance  data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of
              Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by  your  di-
              rect call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

              By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

          ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
              By  default, when you create a new associations, the system runs
              it immediately after it is created and  then  according  to  the
              schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't want an
              association to run immediately after you create it. This parame-
              ter isn't supported for rate expressions.

          CalendarNames -> (list)
              The names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Calendar
              type documents your associations are gated under.  The  associa-
              tions  only  run when that change calendar is open. For more in-
              formation, see Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Change Calen-
              dar .

                     tion concurrently.

                 TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                     The maximum number of errors allowed  before  the  system

                 ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                     The Automation execution role used by the currently  run-
                     ning  Automation.  If not specified, the default value is
                     AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .

          ScheduleOffset -> (integer)
              Number of days to wait after the scheduled day to run an associ-
              ation.

          TargetMaps -> (list)

                 mand continue to run even  if  we  can't  gather  information
                 about  the  state of your CloudWatch alarm. The default value
                 is false .
