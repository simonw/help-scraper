       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-document-metadata-history
          --name <value>
          [--document-version <value>]
          --metadata <value>
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the change template.

       --document-version (string)
          The version of the change template.

       --metadata (string)
          The type of data for which details are being  requested.  Currently,
          the only supported value is DocumentReviews .

          Possible values:

          o DocumentReviews

       --next-token (string)
          The  token  for  the next set of items to return. (You received this
          token from a previous call.)

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of items to return for this call. The  call  also
          returns a token that you can specify in a subsequent call to get the
          next set of results.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
