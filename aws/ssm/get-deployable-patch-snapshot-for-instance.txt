GET-DEPLOYABLE-PATCH-SNAPSHOT-FOR-GET-DEPLOYABLE-PATCH-SNAPSHOT-FOR-INSTANCE()



NAME
       get-deployable-patch-snapshot-for-instance -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the current snapshot for the patch baseline the managed node
       uses. This API is primarily used by  the  AWS-RunPatchBaseline  Systems
       Manager document (SSM document).

       NOTE:
          If you run the command locally, such as with the Command Line Inter-
          face (CLI), the system attempts to use your local  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices  credentials  and  the operation fails. To avoid this, you can
          run the command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager  console.
          Use  Run  Command,  a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
          ager, with an SSM document that enables you to target a managed node
          with  a  script  or  command. For example, run the command using the
          AWS-RunShellScript document or the AWS-RunPowerShellScript document.

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The ID of the managed node for which the appropriate patch  snapshot
          should be retrieved.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The  snapshot ID provided by the user when running AWS-RunPatchBase-
          line .

       --baseline-override (structure)
          Defines the basic information about a patch baseline override.

          OperatingSystem -> (string)
              The operating system rule used by the patch baseline override.

          GlobalFilters -> (structure)
              A set of patch filters, typically used for approval rules.

              PatchFilters -> (list)
                 The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                 (structure)
                     Defines which patches should be included in a patch base-
                     line.

                     A patch filter consists of a key and a set of values. The
                     filter key is a patch property. For example,  the  avail-
                     able  filter  keys  for WINDOWS are PATCH_SET , PRODUCT ,
                     PRODUCT_FAMILY , CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                     The filter values define a  matching  criterion  for  the
                     patch  property indicated by the key. For example, if the
                     filter key is PRODUCT and the filter values are  ["Office
                     2013",  "Office  2016"]  ,  then  the  filter accepts all
                     patches where product name is  either  "Office  2013"  or
                     "Office  2016". The filter values can be exact values for
                     the patch property given as a key,  or  a  wildcard  (*),
                     which matches all values.

                     You  can view lists of valid values for the patch proper-
                     ties by running the DescribePatchProperties command.  For
                     information about which patch properties can be used with
                     each major operating system, see  DescribePatchProperties
                     .

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key for the filter.

                        Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists
                        of valid keys for each operating system type.

                     Values -> (list)
                        The value for the filter key.

                        Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to view lists
                        of valid values for each key based on operating system
                        type.

                        (string)

          ApprovalRules -> (structure)
              A set of rules defining the approval rules for a patch baseline.

              PatchRules -> (list)
                 The rules that make up the rule group.

                 (structure)
                     Defines an approval rule for a patch baseline.

                     PatchFilterGroup -> (structure)
                        The patch filter group that defines the  criteria  for
                        the rule.

                        PatchFilters -> (list)
                            The set of patch filters that make up the group.

                            (structure)
                               Defines  which  patches should be included in a
                               patch baseline.

                               A patch filter consists of a key and a  set  of
                               values. The filter key is a patch property. For
                               example, the available filter keys for  WINDOWS
                               are  PATCH_SET  ,  PRODUCT  ,  PRODUCT_FAMILY ,
                               CLASSIFICATION , and MSRC_SEVERITY .

                               The filter values define a  matching  criterion
                               for  the  patch  property indicated by the key.
                               For example, if the filter key is  PRODUCT  and
                               the  filter  values are ["Office 2013", "Office
                               2016"] , then the filter  accepts  all  patches
                               where  product  name is either "Office 2013" or
                               "Office 2016". The filter values can  be  exact
                               values  for  the patch property given as a key,
                               or a wildcard (*), which matches all values.

                               You can view lists  of  valid  values  for  the
                               patch  properties by running the DescribePatch-
                               Properties command. For information about which
                               patch  properties  can  be used with each major
                               operating system, see   DescribePatchProperties
                               .

                               Key -> (string)
                                   The key for the filter.

                                   Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to
                                   view lists of valid keys for each operating
                                   system type.

                               Values -> (list)
                                   The value for the filter key.

                                   Run the  DescribePatchProperties command to
                                   view lists of valid  values  for  each  key
                                   based on operating system type.

                        approved in the patch baseline. For example,  a  value
                        of  7 means that patches are approved seven days after
                        they are released. Not supported on Debian  Server  or
                        Ubuntu Server.

                     ApproveUntilDate -> (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       To retrieve the current snapshot for the  patch  baseline  an  instance
       uses

       The  following  get-deployable-patch-snapshot-for-instance  example re-
       trieves details for the current snapshot for the specified patch  base-
       line  used  by  an instance. This command must be run from the instance
       using the instance credentials. To ensure it uses the instance  creden-
       tials,  run aws configure and specify only the Region of your instance.
       Leave the Access Key and Secret Key fields empty.

       Tip: Use uuidgen to generate a snapshot-id.

          aws ssm get-deployable-patch-snapshot-for-instance \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --snapshot-id "521c3536-930c-4aa9-950e-01234567abcd"
