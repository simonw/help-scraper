LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()                        LIST-ASSOCIATION-VERSIONS()



NAME
       list-association-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves all versions of an association for a specific association ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-association-versions  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: AssociationVersions

SYNOPSIS
            list-association-versions
          --association-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID for which you want to view all versions.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                        One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance
                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-
                        ify targets, see Registering maintenance window  tasks
                        without  targets  in  the  Amazon Web Services Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<in-
                       stance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

                     o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Val-
                       ues=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-

                     o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                       source-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance   window    targets    only    :    Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target  only  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation  targets   only   :   Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State  Manager  association  targets only : Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*   This example demonstrates how to  tar-
                       get  all  managed  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get   managed   nodes  using  Key,Value  parameters,  see
                     Targeting multiple instances in the Amazon  Web  Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For  example,
                        if  you  specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values for a key might be lower than the global  maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
                 The  cron or rate schedule specified for the association when
                 the association version was created.

              OutputLocation -> (structure)
                 The location in Amazon S3 specified for the association  when
                 the association version was created.

                 S3Location -> (structure)
                     An  S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this
                     request.

                     OutputS3Region -> (string)
                        The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                        The name of the S3 bucket.

                     OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                        The S3 bucket subfolder.

              AssociationName -> (string)
                 The name specified for the association version when the asso-
                 ciation version was created.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The number of errors that are allowed before the system stops
                 sending requests to run the association  on  additional  tar-
                 gets.  You  can  specify either an absolute number of errors,
                 for example 10, or a percentage of the target set, for  exam-
                 ple  10%.  If  you  specify  3, for example, the system stops
                 sending requests when the fourth error is  received.  If  you
                 specify  0,  then the system stops sending requests after the
                 first error is returned. If you run an association on 50 man-
                 aged  nodes  and  set  MaxError to 10%, then the system stops
                 sending the request when the sixth error is received.

                 Executions that are already running an association when  Max-
                 Errors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these
                 executions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there
                 won't  be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxCon-
                 currency to 1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The maximum number of targets allowed to run the  association
                 at  the  same time. You can specify a number, for example 10,
                 or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  The  de-
                 fault value is 100%, which means all targets run the associa-
                 tion at the same time.

                 If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  associa-
                 tion while Systems Manager is running MaxConcurrency associa-
                 tions, the association is allowed to run. During the next as-
                 sociation interval, the new managed node will process its as-
                 sociation within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

              ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
                 The severity level that is assigned to the association.

              SyncCompliance -> (string)
                 The mode for generating association compliance. You can spec-
                 ify AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status
                 of the association execution to determine the compliance sta-
                 tus. If the association execution runs successfully, then the
                 association is  COMPLIANT  .  If  the  association  execution
                 doesn't run successfully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

                 In  MANUAL  mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a pa-
                 rameter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this
                 case, compliance data isn't managed by State Manager, a capa-
                 bility of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is  managed
                 by your direct call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

                 By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

              ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
                 By  default,  when  you create a new associations, the system
                 runs it immediately after it is created and then according to
                 the  schedule you specified. Specify this option if you don't
                 want an association to run immediately after you  create  it.
                 This parameter isn't supported for rate expressions.

              CalendarNames -> (list)
                 The  names or Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of the Change Cal-
                 endar type documents your associations are gated  under.  The
                 associations  for this version only run when that Change Cal-
                 endar is open. For more information, see Amazon Web  Services
                 Systems Manager Change Calendar .

                 (string)

              TargetLocations -> (list)
                 The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon Web
                 Services accounts where you wanted  to  run  the  association

                 (structure)
                     The combination of Amazon Web Services Regions and Amazon
                     Web Services accounts targeted by the current  Automation
                     execution.

                     Accounts -> (list)
                        The  Amazon Web Services accounts targeted by the cur-
                        rent Automation execution.

                        (string)

                     Regions -> (list)

                        rent Automation execution.

                        (string)

                     TargetLocationMaxConcurrency -> (string)

                        Amazon Web Services accounts allowed to run the  Auto-
                        mation concurrently.

                     TargetLocationMaxErrors -> (string)
                        The maximum number of errors allowed before the system
                        stops queueing additional  Automation  executions  for

                     ExecutionRoleName -> (string)
                        The  Automation  execution  role used by the currently
                        running Automation.  If  not  specified,  the  default
                        value is AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole .

              ScheduleOffset -> (integer)
