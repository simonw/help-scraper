DESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WDESCRIBE-MAINTENANCE-WINDOW-EXECUTION-TASK-INVOCATIONS()



NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-execution-task-invocations -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the individual task executions (one per target) for a partic-
       ular task run as part of a maintenance window execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-maintenance-window-execution-task-invocations is  a  paginated
       operation.  Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the
       entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results of the following query expressions: WindowExecution-
       TaskInvocationIdentities

OPTIONS
       --window-execution-id (string)
          The ID of the maintenance window execution the task is part of.

       --task-id (string)
          The ID of the specific task in  the  maintenance  window  task  that
          should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional  filters  used to scope down the returned task invocations.
          The supported filter key is STATUS  with  the  corresponding  values
          PENDING  , IN_PROGRESS , SUCCESS , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , CANCELLING ,
          and CANCELLED .

          (structure)
              Filter used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on  the
              API  operation that includes the filter. API operations that use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
