NAME
       get-document -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  the contents of the specified Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
       document (SSM document).

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-document
          --name <value>
          [--version-name <value>]
          [--document-version <value>]
          [--document-format <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM document.

       --version-name (string)
          An optional field specifying the version of the artifact  associated
          with  the  document. For example, "Release 12, Update 6". This value
          is unique across all versions of a document and can't be changed.

       --document-version (string)
          The document version for which you want information.

       --document-format (string)
          Returns the document in the specified format.  The  document  format
          can be either JSON or YAML. JSON is the default format.

          Possible values:

          o YAML

          o JSON

          o TEXT

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
