DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()                                        DESCRIBE-SESSIONS()



NAME
       describe-sessions -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a  list  of  all active sessions (both connected and discon-
       nected) or terminated sessions from the past 30 days.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-sessions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Sessions

SYNOPSIS
            describe-sessions
          --state <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state (string)
          The  session status to retrieve a list of sessions for. For example,
          "Active".

          Possible values:

          o Active

          o History

       --filters (list)
          One or more filters to limit the type of sessions  returned  by  the
          request.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter for Session Manager information.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              value -> (string)
                 The  filter  value.  Valid  values for each filter key are as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter: Specify a timestamp to  limit  your  results.
                   For  example,  specify 2018-08-29T00:00:00Z to see sessions
                   that started August 29, 2018, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore: Specify a timestamp to limit  your  results.
                   For  example,  specify 2018-08-29T00:00:00Z to see sessions
                   that started before August 29, 2018.

                 o Target: Specify a managed node to which session connections
                   have been made.

                 o Owner: Specify an Amazon Web Services user account to see a
                   list of sessions started by that user.

                 o Status: Specify a valid session status to see a list of all
                   sessions  with  that  status. Status values you can specify
                   include:

                   o Connected

                   o Connecting

                   o Disconnected

                   o Terminated

                   o Terminating

                   o Failed

                 o SessionId: Specify a session ID to return details about the
                   session.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Target"|"Owner"|"Status"|"SessionId",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To list all active Session Manager sessions

       This  describe-sessions example retrieves a list of the active sessions
       created most recently (both connected and disconnected  sessions)  over
       the  past 30 days that were started by the specified user. This command
       returns only results for connections to targets initiated using Session
       Manager. It does not list connections made through other means, such as
       Remote Desktop Connections or SSH.

          aws ssm describe-sessions \
              --state "Active" \
              --filters "key=Owner,value=arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez"

       Output:

          {
              "Sessions": [
                  {
                      "SessionId": "John-07a16060613c408b5",
                      "Target": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Connected",
                      "StartDate": 1550676938.352,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez",
                      "OutputUrl": {}
                  },
                  {
                      "SessionId": "John-01edf534b8b56e8eb",
                      "Target": "i-9876543210abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Connected",
                      "StartDate": 1550676842.194,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Shirley-Rodriguez",
                      "OutputUrl": {}
                  }
              ]
          }

       Example 2: To list all terminated Session Manager sessions

       This describe-sessions example retrieves a list of  the  most  recently
       terminated sessions from the past 30 days for all users.

          aws ssm describe-sessions \
              --state "History"

       Output:

          {
              "Sessions": [
                  {
                      "SessionId": "Mary-Major-0022b1eb2b0d9e3bd",
                      "Target": "i-1234567890abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Terminated",
                      "StartDate": 1550520701.256,
                      "EndDate": 1550521931.563,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Mary-Major"
                  },
                  {
                      "SessionId": "Jane-Roe-0db53f487931ed9d4",
                      "Target": "i-9876543210abcdef0",
                      "Status": "Terminated",
                      "StartDate": 1550161369.149,
                      "EndDate": 1550162580.329,
                      "Owner": "arn:aws:sts::123456789012:assumed-role/Administrator/Jane-Roe"
                  },
                  ...
