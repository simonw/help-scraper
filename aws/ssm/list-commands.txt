LIST-COMMANDS()                                                LIST-COMMANDS()



NAME
       list-commands -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  commands  requested by users of the Amazon Web Services ac-
       count.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-commands is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Commands

SYNOPSIS
            list-commands
          [--command-id <value>]
          [--instance-id <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --command-id (string)
          (Optional) If provided, lists only the specified command.

       --instance-id (string)
          (Optional) Lists commands issued against this managed node ID.

          NOTE:
              You can't specify a managed node ID in the same command that you
              specify Status = Pending . This is because  the  command  hasn't
              reached the managed node yet.

       --filters (list)
          (Optional)  One  or more filters. Use a filter to return a more spe-
          cific list of results.

          (structure)
              Describes a command filter.

              NOTE:
                 A managed node ID can't be specified when a command status is
                 Pending because the command hasn't run on the node yet.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The ExecutionStage filter can't be used with the ListCom-
                     mandInvocations operation, only with ListCommands .

              value -> (string)
                 The filter value. Valid values for each  filter  key  are  as
                 follows:

                 o InvokedAfter  :  Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions occurring July 7, 2021, and later.

                 o InvokedBefore  : Specify a timestamp to limit your results.
                   For example, specify 2021-07-07T00:00:00Z to see a list  of
                   command executions from before July 7, 2021.

                 o Status  :  Specify  a valid command status to see a list of
                   all command executions with that status. The status choices
                   depend on the API you call. The status values you can spec-
                   ify for ListCommands are:

                   o Pending

                   o InProgress

                   o Success

                   o Cancelled

                   o Failed

                   o TimedOut (this includes both Delivery and Execution  time
                     outs)

                   o AccessDenied

                   o DeliveryTimedOut

                   o ExecutionTimedOut

                   o Incomplete

                   o NoInstancesInTag

                   o LimitExceeded

                 The  status values you can specify for ListCommandInvocations
                 are:

                     o Pending

                     o InProgress

                     o Delayed

                     o Success

                     o Cancelled

                     o Failed

                     o TimedOut (this includes  both  Delivery  and  Execution
                       time outs)

                     o AccessDenied

                     o DeliveryTimedOut

                     o ExecutionTimedOut

                     o Undeliverable

                     o InvalidPlatform

                     o Terminated

                 o DocumentName : Specify name of the Amazon Web Services Sys-
                   tems Manager document (SSM document) for which you want  to
                   see   command   execution  results.  For  example,  specify
                   AWS-RunPatchBaseline to see command  executions  that  used
                   this  SSM  document to perform security patching operations
                   on managed nodes.

                 o ExecutionStage : Specify one of the following values (List-
                   Commands operations only):

                   o Executing : Returns a list of command executions that are
                     currently still running.

                   o Complete : Returns a list of command executions that have
                     already completed.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InvokedAfter"|"InvokedBefore"|"Status"|"ExecutionStage"|"DocumentName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

                     o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This  example  demonstrates how to target all resources
                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              RequestedDateTime -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time the command was requested.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the command.

              StatusDetails -> (string)
                 A detailed status of the command execution. StatusDetails in-
                 cludes  more  information  than  Status  because  it includes
                 states resulting from error and concurrency  control  parame-
                 ters.  StatusDetails  can show different results than Status.
                 For more information about these statuses, see  Understanding
                 command  statuses  in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide . StatusDetails can be one of the  following  val-
                 ues:

                 o Pending: The command hasn't been sent to any managed nodes.

                 o In Progress: The command has been sent to at least one man-
                   aged node but hasn't reached a final state on  all  managed
                   nodes.

                 o Success:  The  command successfully ran on all invocations.
                   This is a terminal state.

                 o Delivery Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more  command
                   invocations shows a status of Delivery Timed Out. This is a
                   terminal state.

                 o Execution Timed Out: The value of MaxErrors or more command
                   invocations  shows a status of Execution Timed Out. This is
                   a terminal state.

                 o Failed: The value of MaxErrors or more command  invocations
                   shows a status of Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Incomplete:  The command was attempted on all managed nodes
                   and one or more invocations doesn't have a value of Success
                   but  not  enough  invocations  failed  for the status to be
                   Failed. This is a terminal state.

                 o Cancelled: The command was terminated before  it  was  com-
                   pleted. This is a terminal state.

                 o Rate  Exceeded: The number of managed nodes targeted by the
                   command exceeded the account limit for pending invocations.
                   The  system  has  canceled the command before running it on
                   any managed node. This is a terminal state.

              OutputS3Region -> (string)
                 (Deprecated) You can no longer specify  this  parameter.  The
                 system ignores it. Instead, Systems Manager automatically de-
                 termines the Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

              OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket where the responses to the  command  executions
                 should  be  stored.  This was requested when issuing the com-
                 mand.

              OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                 The S3 directory path inside the bucket where  the  responses
                 to  the  command  executions  should  be stored. This was re-
                 quested when issuing the command.

              MaxConcurrency -> (string)
                 The maximum number of managed nodes that are allowed  to  run
                 the  command  at  the  same time. You can specify a number of
                 managed nodes, such as 10, or a percentage of nodes, such  as
                 10%.  The default value is 50. For more information about how
                 to use MaxConcurrency , see Running  commands  using  Systems
                 Manager  Run  Command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager User Guide .

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The maximum number of errors allowed before the system  stops
                 sending  the command to additional targets. You can specify a
                 number of errors, such as 10, or a percentage or errors, such
                 as  10%.  The default value is 0 . For more information about
                 how to use MaxErrors , see  Running  commands  using  Systems
                 Manager  Run  Command in the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
                 ager User Guide .
