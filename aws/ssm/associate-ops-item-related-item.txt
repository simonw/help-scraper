SYNOPSIS
            associate-ops-item-related-item
          --ops-item-id <value>
          --association-type <value>
          --resource-type <value>
          --resource-uri <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --ops-item-id (string)
          The ID of the OpsItem to which you want to associate a resource as a
          related item.

       --association-type (string)
          The  type  of association that you want to create between an OpsItem
          and a resource. OpsCenter supports IsParentOf and RelatesTo associa-
          tion types.

       --resource-type (string)
          The type of resource that you want to associate with an OpsItem. Op-
          sCenter supports the following types:
              AWS::SSMIncidents::IncidentRecord : an  Incident  Manager  inci-
              dent.

              AWS::SSM::Document : a Systems Manager (SSM) document.

       --resource-uri (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon Web Services resource
          that you want to associate with the OpsItem.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
