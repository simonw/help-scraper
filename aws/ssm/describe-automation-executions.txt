NAME
       describe-automation-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Provides details about all active and terminated Automation executions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-automation-executions  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: AutomationExecutionMetadataList

SYNOPSIS
            describe-automation-executions
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Filters used to limit the scope of executions that are requested.

          (structure)
              A filter used to match specific automation executions.  This  is
              used  to limit the scope of Automation execution information re-
              turned.

              Key -> (string)
                 One or more keys to limit the results.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values used to limit the execution information associated
                 with the filter's key.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "DocumentNamePrefix"|"ExecutionStatus"|"ExecutionId"|"ParentExecutionId"|"CurrentAction"|"StartTimeBefore"|"StartTimeAfter"|"AutomationType"|"TagKey"|"TargetResourceGroup"|"AutomationSubtype"|"OpsItemId",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                     during the Automation execution.

                 Truncated -> (boolean)
                     A boolean value indicating whether  the  resolved  target
                     list is truncated.

                 and  accounts in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User
                 Guide .

                     The  Automation  runbooks specified for the runbook work-
                     flow can't run  until  all  required  approvals  for  the

                               could  specify value:WebServer to run a command
                               on instances that include EC2 tags  of  Server-
                               Role,WebServer .

                               Depending  on  the  type of target, the maximum
                               number of values for a key might be lower  than
                               the global maximum of 50.
