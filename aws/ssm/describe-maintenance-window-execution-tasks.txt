NAME
       describe-maintenance-window-execution-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       For  a  given  maintenance  window execution, lists the tasks that were
       run.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-maintenance-window-execution-tasks is a  paginated  operation.
       Multiple  API  calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data
       set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the  --no-pagi-
       nate  argument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a
       paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the re-
       sults of the following query expressions: WindowExecutionTaskIdentities

SYNOPSIS
            describe-maintenance-window-execution-tasks
          --window-execution-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --window-execution-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  maintenance window execution whose task executions
          should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Optional filters used to scope down the  returned  tasks.  The  sup-
          ported  filter key is STATUS with the corresponding values PENDING ,
          IN_PROGRESS , SUCCESS , FAILED , TIMED_OUT , CANCELLING ,  and  CAN-
          CELLED .

          (structure)
              Filter  used in the request. Supported filter keys depend on the
              API operation that includes the filter. API operations that  use
              MaintenanceWindowFilter> include the following:

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutions

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTaskInvocations

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowExecutionTasks

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindows

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTargets

              o DescribeMaintenanceWindowTasks

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The filter values.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all tasks associated with a maintenance window execution

       The  following  ssm describe-maintenance-window-execution-tasks example
       lists the tasks associated with the specified maintenance window execu-
       tion.

          aws ssm describe-maintenance-window-execution-tasks \
              --window-execution-id "518d5565-5969-4cca-8f0e-da3b2EXAMPLE"

              "WindowExecutionTaskIdentities": [
                  {
