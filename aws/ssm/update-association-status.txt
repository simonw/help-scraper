UPDATE-ASSOCIATION-STATUS()                        UPDATE-ASSOCIATION-STATUS()



NAME
       update-association-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the status of the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document
       (SSM document) associated with the specified managed node.
          UpdateAssociationStatus is primarily used by the Amazon Web Services
          Systems  Manager  Agent  (SSM  Agent) to report status updates about
          your associations and is only used for associations created with the
          InstanceId legacy parameter.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the SSM document.

       --instance-id (string)
          The managed node ID.

       --association-status (structure)
          The association status.

          Date -> (timestamp)
              The date when the status changed.

          Name -> (string)
              The status.

          Message -> (string)
              The reason for the status.

          AdditionalInfo -> (string)
              A user-defined string.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Date=timestamp,Name=string,Message=string,AdditionalInfo=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Date": timestamp,
            "Name": "Pending"|"Success"|"Failed",
            "Message": "string",
            "AdditionalInfo": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update the association status

       The following update-association-status example updates the association
       status of the association between an instance and a document.

          aws ssm update-association-status \
              --name "AWS-UpdateSSMAgent" \
              --instance-id "i-1234567890abcdef0" \
              --association-status "Date=1424421071.939,Name=Pending,Message=temp_status_change,AdditionalInfo=Additional-Config-Needed"

                     One or more targets must  be  specified  for  maintenance
                     window  Run  Command-type  tasks.  Depending on the task,
                     targets are optional for other  maintenance  window  task
                     types  (Automation, Lambda, and Step Functions). For more
                     information about running tasks that don't  specify  tar-
                     gets,  see  Registering  maintenance window tasks without
                     targets in the Amazon Web Services Systems  Manager  User
                     Guide .

                 Supported formats include the following.

                 o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<instance-id-2>,<in-
                   stance-id-3>

                 o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Val-

                 o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                 o Run  Command  and Maintenance window targets only : Key=re-
                   source-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                 o Maintenance window targets only  :  Key=resource-groups:Re-

                 o Automation  targets  only  :  Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                   source-group-name>

                 For example:

                 o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAMPLE,i-0471e04240EX-
                   AMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                 o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,CostCen-
                   ter3

                 o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                 o Run  Command  and Maintenance window targets only : Key=re-
                   source-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup      This
                   example demonstrates how to target all resources in the re-
                   source group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your  maintenance
                   window.

                 o Maintenance  window  targets only : Key=resource-groups:Re-
                   sourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::INSTANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC
                   This example demonstrates how to target only Amazon Elastic
                   Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and VPCs in your main-
                   tenance window.

                 o Automation  targets  only  : Key=ResourceGroup,Values=MyRe-
                   sourceGroup

                 o State  Manager  association  targets  only  :   Key=Instan-
                   ceIds,Values=*    This  example  demonstrates how to target
                   all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Region
                   where the association was created.

                 For  more  information about how to send commands that target
                 managed nodes using Key,Value parameters, see Targeting  mul-
                 tiple  instances  in  the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager
                 User Guide .

                 Key -> (string)
                     User-defined criteria for sending  commands  that  target
                     managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                 Values -> (list)
                     User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if
                     you  specified  tag:ServerRole  ,   you   could   specify
                     value:WebServer  to  run  a command on instances that in-
                     clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending on the type of target, the  maximum  number  of
                     values  for  a key might be lower than the global maximum
                     of 50.

                     (string)

          ScheduleExpression -> (string)
              A cron expression that specifies a schedule when the association
              runs.

          OutputLocation -> (structure)
              An  S3  bucket where you want to store the output details of the
              request.

              S3Location -> (structure)
                 An S3 bucket where you want to store the results of this  re-
                 quest.

                 OutputS3Region -> (string)
                     The Amazon Web Services Region of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3BucketName -> (string)
                     The name of the S3 bucket.

                 OutputS3KeyPrefix -> (string)
                     The S3 bucket subfolder.

          LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The date on which the association was last run.

          LastSuccessfulExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
              The last date on which the association was successfully run.

          AssociationName -> (string)
              The association name.

          MaxErrors -> (string)
              The  number  of  errors that are allowed before the system stops
              sending requests to run the association on  additional  targets.
              You can specify either an absolute number of errors, for example
              10, or a percentage of the target set, for example 10%.  If  you
              specify  3,  for example, the system stops sending requests when
              the fourth error is received. If you specify 0, then the  system
              stops sending requests after the first error is returned. If you
              run an association on 50 managed nodes and set MaxError to  10%,
              then  the  system stops sending the request when the sixth error
              is received.

              Executions that are already running an association  when  MaxEr-
              rors  is reached are allowed to complete, but some of these exe-
              cutions may fail as well. If you need to ensure that there won't
              be more than max-errors failed executions, set MaxConcurrency to
              1 so that executions proceed one at a time.

          MaxConcurrency -> (string)
              The maximum number of targets allowed to run the association  at
              the  same  time.  You can specify a number, for example 10, or a
              percentage of the target set, for example 10%. The default value
              is 100%, which means all targets run the association at the same
              time.

              If a new managed node starts and attempts to run an  association
              while  Systems  Manager  is running MaxConcurrency associations,
              the association is allowed to run. During the  next  association
              interval,  the  new  managed  node  will process its association
              within the limit specified for MaxConcurrency .

          ComplianceSeverity -> (string)
              The severity level that is assigned to the association.

          SyncCompliance -> (string)
              The mode for generating association compliance. You can  specify
              AUTO or MANUAL . In AUTO mode, the system uses the status of the
              association execution to determine the compliance status. If the
              association execution runs successfully, then the association is
              COMPLIANT . If the association execution  doesn't  run  success-
              fully, the association is NON-COMPLIANT .

              In  MANUAL mode, you must specify the AssociationId as a parame-
              ter for the  PutComplianceItems API  operation.  In  this  case,
              compliance  data isn't managed by State Manager, a capability of
              Amazon Web Services Systems Manager. It is managed by  your  di-
              rect call to the  PutComplianceItems API operation.

              By default, all associations use AUTO mode.

          ApplyOnlyAtCronInterval -> (boolean)
              By  default, when you create a new associations, the system runs
              it immediately after it is created and  then  according  to  the
