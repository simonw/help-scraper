LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()                                        LIST-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  all  State Manager associations in the current Amazon Web Ser-
       vices account and Amazon Web Services Region. You can limit the results
       to  a  specific  State  Manager association document or managed node by
       specifying a filter. State Manager is a capability of Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices Systems Manager.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-associations  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Associations

SYNOPSIS
            list-associations
          [--association-filter-list <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-filter-list (list)
          One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list  of
          results.

          NOTE:
              Filtering  associations  using the InstanceID attribute only re-
              turns legacy associations created using  the  InstanceID  attri-
              bute.  Associations  targeting the managed node that are part of
              the Target Attributes ResourceGroup or Tags aren't returned.

          (structure)
              Describes a filter.

              key -> (string)
                 The name of the filter.

                 NOTE:
                     InstanceId has been deprecated.

              value -> (string)
                 The filter value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          key=string,value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "key": "InstanceId"|"Name"|"AssociationId"|"AssociationStatusName"|"LastExecutedBefore"|"LastExecutedAfter"|"AssociationName"|"ResourceGroupName",
              "value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Associations -> (list)
          The associations.

          (structure)
              Describes an association of a Amazon Web Services  Systems  Man-
              ager document (SSM document) and a managed node.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SSM document.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The managed node ID.

              AssociationId -> (string)
                 The  ID created by the system when you create an association.
                 An association is a binding between a document and a  set  of
                 targets with a schedule.

              AssociationVersion -> (string)
                 The association version.

              DocumentVersion -> (string)
                 The  version  of the document used in the association. If you
                 change a document version for a  State  Manager  association,
                 Systems  Manager  immediately runs the association unless you
                 previously specifed the  apply-only-at-cron-interval  parame-
                 ter.

                 WARNING:
                     State  Manager  doesn't support running associations that
                     use a new version of  a  document  if  that  document  is
                     shared  from  another  account. State Manager always runs
                     the default version of a document if shared from  another
                     account,  even  though  the Systems Manager console shows
                     that a new version was processed. If you want to  run  an
                     association using a new version of a document shared form
                     another account, you must set the document version to de-
                     fault .

              Targets -> (list)
                 The  managed nodes targeted by the request to create an asso-
                 ciation. You can target all managed nodes in  an  Amazon  Web
                 Services  account  by  specifying  the InstanceIds key with a
                 value of * .

                 (structure)
                     An array of search criteria that  targets  managed  nodes
                     using a key-value pair that you specify.

                     NOTE:
                        One  or more targets must be specified for maintenance
                        window Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the  task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types (Automation, Lambda, and  Step  Functions).  For
                        more  information about running tasks that don't spec-
                        ify targets, see Registering maintenance window  tasks
                        without  targets  in  the  Amazon Web Services Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<in-
                       stance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

                     o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Val-
                       ues=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-

                       source-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                     o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                       source-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                     o Key=tag:CostCenter,Values=CostCenter1,CostCenter2,Cost-
                       Center3

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only  :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This example demonstrates how to target  all  resources
                       in  the  resource group ProductionResourceGroup in your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance   window    targets    only    :    Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target  only  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation  targets   only   :   Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State  Manager  association  targets only : Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*   This example demonstrates how to  tar-
                       get  all  managed  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get   managed   nodes  using  Key,Value  parameters,  see
                     Targeting multiple instances in the Amazon  Web  Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined criteria that maps to Key . For  example,
                        if  you  specified  tag:ServerRole , you could specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values for a key might be lower than the global  maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                        (string)

              LastExecutionDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date on which the association was last run.

              Overview -> (structure)
                 Information about the association.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The  status  of  the association. Status can be: Pending,
                     Success, or Failed.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)
                     A detailed status of the association.

                 AssociationStatusAggregatedCount -> (map)
                     Returns the number of targets for the association status.
                     For  example, if you created an association with two man-
                     aged nodes, and one of them was  successful,  this  would
                     return the count of managed nodes by status.

                     key -> (string)

                     value -> (integer)

              ScheduleExpression -> (string)
