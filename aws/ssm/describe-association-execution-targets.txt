NAME
       describe-association-execution-targets -

DESCRIPTION
       Views information about a specific execution of a specific association.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-association-execution-targets is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: AssociationExecutionTargets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-association-execution-targets
          --association-id <value>
          --execution-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-id (string)
          The association ID that includes the execution for which you want to
          view details.

       --execution-id (string)
          The execution ID for which you want to view details.

       --filters (list)
          Filters  for  the request. You can specify the following filters and
          values.

          Status (EQUAL)

          ResourceId (EQUAL)

          ResourceType (EQUAL)

          (structure)
              Filters for the association execution.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key value used in the request.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value specified for the key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "Status"|"ResourceId"|"ResourceType",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get details of an association execution

       The following describe-association-execution-targets example  describes
       the specified association execution.

          aws ssm describe-association-execution-targets \
              --association-id "8dfe3659-4309-493a-8755-0123456789ab" \
              --execution-id "7abb6378-a4a5-4f10-8312-0123456789ab"

       Output:

                      "AssociationVersion": "1",

                  }
              ]
          }
