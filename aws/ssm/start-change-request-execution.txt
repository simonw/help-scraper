OPTIONS
       --scheduled-time (timestamp)
          The date and time specified in the change request to run the Automa-
          tion runbooks.

          NOTE:
              The Automation runbooks specified for the runbook workflow can't
              run  until  all  required  approvals for the change request have
              been received.

       --document-name (string)
          The name of the change template document to run during  the  runbook
          workflow.

       --document-version (string)
          The  version  of the change template document to run during the run-
          book workflow.

       --parameters (map)
          A key-value map of parameters that match the declared parameters  in
          the change template document.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (list)
              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": ["string", ...]
            ...}

       --change-request-name (string)
          The  name of the change request associated with the runbook workflow
          to be run.

       --client-token (string)
          The user-provided idempotency token. The token must  be  unique,  is
          case insensitive, enforces the UUID format, and can't be reused.

       --auto-approve | --no-auto-approve (boolean)
          Indicates  whether  the change request can be approved automatically
          without the need for manual approvals.

          If AutoApprovable is enabled in a change template, then setting  Au-
          toApprove  to  true  in StartChangeRequestExecution creates a change
          request that bypasses approver review.

          NOTE:
              Change Calendar restrictions are not bypassed in this  scenario.
              If the state of an associated calendar is CLOSED , change freeze
              approvers must still grant permission for this change request to
              run. If they don't, the change won't be processed until the cal-
              endar state is again OPEN .

       --runbooks (list)
          Information about the Automation runbooks that are  run  during  the
          runbook workflow.

          NOTE:
              The Automation runbooks specified for the runbook workflow can't
              run until all required approvals for  the  change  request  have
              been received.

                        window  Run Command-type tasks. Depending on the task,
                        targets are optional for other maintenance window task
                        types  (Automation,  Lambda,  and Step Functions). For
                        more information about running tasks that don't  spec-
                        ify  targets, see Registering maintenance window tasks
                        without targets in the  Amazon  Web  Services  Systems
                        Manager User Guide .

                     Supported formats include the following.

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=<instance-id-1>,<in-
                       stance-id-2>,<instance-id-3>

                     o Key=tag:<my-tag-key>,Val-
                       ues=<my-tag-value-1>,<my-tag-value-2>

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=<my-tag-key-1>,<my-tag-key-2>

                     o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=<resource-group-name>

                     o Maintenance   window    targets    only    :    Key=re-

                       source-type-1>,<resource-type-2>

                     o Automation targets only : Key=ResourceGroup;Values=<re-
                       source-group-name>

                     For example:

                     o Key=InstanceIds,Values=i-02573cafcfEXAM-
                       PLE,i-0471e04240EXAMPLE,i-07782c72faEXAMPLE

                       Center3

                     o Key=tag-key,Values=Name,Instance-Type,CostCenter

                     o Run  Command  and  Maintenance  window  targets  only :
                       Key=resource-groups:Name,Values=ProductionResourceGroup
                       This  example  demonstrates how to target all resources
                       in the resource group ProductionResourceGroup  in  your
                       maintenance window.

                     o Maintenance    window    targets    only    :   Key=re-
                       source-groups:ResourceTypeFilters,Values=AWS::EC2::IN-
                       STANCE,AWS::EC2::VPC   This example demonstrates how to
                       target only Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud  (Amazon  EC2)
                       instances and VPCs in your maintenance window.

                     o Automation   targets   only   :  Key=ResourceGroup,Val-
                       ues=MyResourceGroup

                     o State Manager association targets  only  :  Key=Instan-
                       ceIds,Values=*    This example demonstrates how to tar-
                       get all managed instances in the  Amazon  Web  Services
                       Region where the association was created.

                     For more information about how to send commands that tar-
                     get  managed  nodes  using  Key,Value   parameters,   see
                     Targeting  multiple  instances in the Amazon Web Services
                     Systems Manager User Guide .

                     Key -> (string)
                        User-defined criteria for sending commands that target
                        managed nodes that meet the criteria.

                     Values -> (list)
                        User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example,
                        if you specified tag:ServerRole ,  you  could  specify
                        value:WebServer to run a command on instances that in-
                        clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                        Depending on the type of target, the maximum number of
                        values  for a key might be lower than the global maxi-
                        mum of 50.

                 ation  started,  indicating  the  maximum number of resources
                 that the runbook operation can run on at the same time.

              MaxErrors -> (string)
                 The MaxErrors value specified by the user when the  execution
                 started, indicating the maximum number of errors that can oc-
                 cur during the operation before the updates  are  stopped  or
                 rolled back.

            ...
          ]

       --tags (list)
          Optional  metadata  that you assign to a resource. You can specify a
          maximum of five tags for a change request. Tags enable you to  cate-
          gorize  a  resource in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, or
          environment. For example, you might want to tag a change request  to
          identify  an  environment  or  target Amazon Web Services Region. In
          this case, you could specify the following key-value pairs:

          o Key=Environment,Value=Production

          o Key=Region,Value=us-east-2

          (structure)
              Metadata that you assign to your Amazon Web Services  resources.
              Tags  enable you to categorize your resources in different ways,
              for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.  In  Amazon  Web
              Services  Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems Manager
              documents (SSM documents), managed nodes,  maintenance  windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --scheduled-end-time (timestamp)
          The  time that the requester expects the runbook workflow related to
          the change request to complete. The time is an  estimate  only  that
          the requester provides for reviewers.

       --change-details (string)
          User-provided  details about the change. If no details are provided,
          content specified in the Template information section of the associ-
          ated change template is added.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To start a change request

       The  following  start-change-request-execution  example starts a change
       request with minimal options specified.

          aws ssm start-change-request-execution \
              --change-request-name MyChangeRequest \
              --document-name AWS-HelloWorldChangeTemplate \
