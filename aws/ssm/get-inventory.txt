GET-INVENTORY()                                                GET-INVENTORY()



NAME
       get-inventory -

DESCRIPTION
       Query inventory information. This includes managed node status, such as
       Stopped or Terminated .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-inventory is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Entities

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)

          results.

          (structure)
              One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more specific list
              of results.

                 The name of the filter key.

              Values -> (list)
                 Inventory filter values. Example: inventory filter where man-
                 aged node IDs are specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceInfor-
                 mation.InstanceId,Values=                     i-a12b3c4d5e6g,
                 i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal .

                 (string)

                 The type of filter.

                 NOTE:
                     The Exists filter must be used with aggregators. For more
                     information, see Aggregating inventory data in the Amazon
                     Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"BeginWith"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"|"Exists"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --aggregators (list)
          Returns counts of inventory types based on one or more  expressions.
          For  example,  if you aggregate by using an expression that uses the
          AWS:InstanceInformation.PlatformType type, you can see  a  count  of
          how  many  Windows and Linux managed nodes exist in your inventoried
          fleet.

          (structure)
              Specifies the inventory type and attribute for  the  aggregation
              execution.

              Expression -> (string)
                 The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

              Aggregators -> (list)
                 Nested  aggregators  to further refine aggregation for an in-
                 ventory type.

                 (structure)
                     Specifies the inventory type and attribute for the aggre-
                     gation execution.

                     Expression -> (string)
                        The inventory type and attribute name for aggregation.

                     Groups -> (list)
                        A  user-defined set of one or more filters on which to
                        aggregate inventory data. Groups return a count of re-
                        sources  that match and don't match the specified cri-
                        teria.

                            to aggregate inventory data. Groups return a count
                            of resources that match and don't match the speci-
                            fied criteria.

                               Filters  define the criteria for the group. The
                               matchingCount field displays the number of  re-
                               sources  that match the criteria. The notMatch-
                               ingCount field displays the number of resources
                               that don't match the criteria.

                                      tory  filter  where managed node IDs are
                                      specified as values  Key=AWS:InstanceIn-
                                      formation.InstanceId,Values=
                                      i-a12b3c4d5e6g, i-1a2b3c4d5e6,Type=Equal
                                      .

                                          The  Exists filter must be used with
                                          aggregators. For  more  information,

                 A  user-defined set of one or more filters on which to aggre-
                 gate inventory data. Groups return a count of resources  that
                 match and don't match the specified criteria.

                     Filters -> (list)
                        Filters define the criteria for the group. The  match-
                        ingCount  field  displays the number of resources that
                        match the criteria. The  notMatchingCount  field  dis-
                        plays  the  number  of  resources that don't match the
                        criteria.

                        (structure)
                            One or more filters. Use a filter to return a more

       --result-attributes (list)
          The list of inventory item types to return.

          (structure)
              The inventory item result attribute.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 Name of the inventory item type. Valid value: AWS:InstanceIn-
                 formation . Default Value: AWS:InstanceInformation .

       Shorthand Syntax:

       JSON Syntax:

          [

            }

          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

                     CaptureTime -> (string)
                        The time inventory item data was captured.

                     ContentHash -> (string)
                        MD5 hash of the inventory item type contents. The con-
                        tent hash is used to determine whether to  update  in-
                        ventory  information. The PutInventory API doesn't up-
                        date the inventory item type contents if the MD5  hash
                        hasn't changed since last update.

                     Content -> (list)
                        Contains  all the inventory data of the item type. Re-
                        sults include attribute names and values.

                        (map)
                            key -> (string)

                            value -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
