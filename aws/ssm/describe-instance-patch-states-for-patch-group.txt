NAME
       describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the high-level patch state for the managed nodes in the spec-
       ified patch group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group is  a  paginated  opera-
       tion.  Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire
       data set of results.  You  can  disable  pagination  by  providing  the
       --no-paginate argument.  When using --output text and the --query argu-
       ment on a paginated response, the --query argument  must  extract  data
       from  the  results  of  the following query expressions: InstancePatch-
       States

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-patch-states-for-patch-group
          --patch-group <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --patch-group (string)
          The name of the patch group for which the  patch  state  information
          should be retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Each entry in the array is a structure containing:

          o Key (string between 1 and 200 characters)

          o Values (array containing a single string)

          o Type (string "Equal", "NotEqual", "LessThan", "GreaterThan")

          (structure)
              Defines  a  filter used in  DescribeInstancePatchStatesForPatch-
              Group to scope down the information returned by the API.
                 Example : To filter for all managed nodes in  a  patch  group
                 having more than three patches with a FailedCount status, use
                 the following for the filter:

              o Value for Key : FailedCount

              o Value for Type : GreaterThan

              o Value for Values : 3

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter. Supported values include the  follow-
                 ing:

                 o InstalledCount

                 o InstalledOtherCount

                 o InstalledPendingRebootCount

                 o InstalledRejectedCount

                 o MissingCount

                 o FailedCount

                 o UnreportedNotApplicableCount

                 o NotApplicableCount

              Values -> (list)
                 The  value for the filter. Must be an integer greater than or
                 equal to 0.

                 (string)

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of comparison  that  should  be  performed  for  the
                 value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string,Type=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...],
              "Type": "Equal"|"NotEqual"|"LessThan"|"GreaterThan"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

          (structure)
              Defines  the  high-level  patch  compliance  state for a managed
              node, providing information about the number of installed, miss-
              ing,  not  applicable,  and  failed  patches along with metadata
              about the operation when this information was gathered  for  the
              managed node.

              InstanceId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of  the managed node the high-level patch compliance
                 information was collected for.

              PatchGroup -> (string)
                 The name of the patch group the managed node belongs to.

              BaselineId -> (string)
                 The ID of the patch baseline used to patch the managed node.

              SnapshotId -> (string)
                 The ID of the patch baseline snapshot used during the  patch-
                 ing operation when this compliance data was collected.

              InstallOverrideList -> (string)
                 An  https URL or an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
                 path-style URL to a list of patches  to  be  installed.  This
                 patch  installation  list, which you maintain in an S3 bucket
                 in YAML format and specify in the SSM document  AWS-RunPatch-
                 Baseline  ,  overrides  the  patches specified by the default
                 patch baseline.

                 For more information about the InstallOverrideList parameter,
                 see         About         the         ``AWS-RunPatchBaseline`

                 The  number  of  patches from the patch baseline that are in-
                 stalled on the managed node.

              InstalledOtherCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches not specified  in  the  patch  baseline
                 that are installed on the managed node.

              InstalledPendingRebootCount -> (integer)

                 The number of patches installed on a managed  node  that  are
                 specified in a RejectedPatches list. Patches with a status of
                 InstalledRejected were typically installed before  they  were
                 added to a RejectedPatches list.

                 NOTE:
                     If  ALLOW_AS_DEPENDENCY  is  the specified option for Re-
                     jectedPatchesAction , the value of InstalledRejectedCount
                     will always be 0 (zero).

              MissingCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that are appli-
                 cable for the managed node but aren't currently installed.

              FailedCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that  were  at-
                 tempted  to  be installed during the last patching operation,
                 but failed to install.

              UnreportedNotApplicableCount -> (integer)
                 The number of patches beyond the supported limit of NotAppli-
                 cableCount  that aren't reported by name to Inventory. Inven-

                 The number of patches from the patch baseline that aren't ap-
                 plicable  for the managed node and therefore aren't installed
                 on the node. This number may be  truncated  if  the  list  of
                 patch  names is very large. The number of patches beyond this
                 limit are reported in UnreportedNotApplicableCount .

              OperationStartTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time the most recent patching operation  was  started  on
                 the managed node.

              OperationEndTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time the most recent patching operation completed on the
                 managed node.

              Operation -> (string)
                 The type of patching operation that was performed: or

                 o SCAN assesses the patch compliance state.

                 o INSTALL installs missing patches.

              LastNoRebootInstallOperationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time of the last attempt to patch the managed  node  with
                 NoReboot specified as the reboot option.

              RebootOption -> (string)
                 Indicates the reboot option specified in the patch baseline.

                 NOTE:
                     Reboot  options apply to Install operations only. Reboots
                     aren't attempted for Patch Manager Scan operations.

                 o RebootIfNeeded : Patch Manager tries to reboot the  managed
                   node if it installed any patches, or if any patches are de-
                   tected with a status of InstalledPendingReboot .

                 o NoReboot : Patch Manager attempts to install missing  pack-
                   ages without trying to reboot the system. Patches installed
                   with this option are assigned a status of  InstalledPendin-
                   gReboot  . These patches might not be in effect until a re-
                   boot is performed.

              CriticalNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of managed nodes where patches that are  specified
                 as  Critical  for  compliance reporting in the patch baseline
                 aren't installed. These patches might be missing, have failed
                 installation, were rejected, or were installed but awaiting a
                 required managed node reboot. The  status  of  these  managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

              SecurityNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of managed nodes where patches that are specified
                 as Security in  a  patch  advisory  aren't  installed.  These
                 patches  might be missing, have failed installation, were re-
                 jected, or were installed but  awaiting  a  required  managed
                 node reboot. The status of these managed nodes is NON_COMPLI-
                 ANT .

              OtherNonCompliantCount -> (integer)
                 The number of managed nodes with patches installed  that  are
                 specified  as other than Critical or Security but aren't com-
                 pliant with the patch baseline. The status of  these  managed
                 nodes is NON_COMPLIANT .

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use when requesting the next set of items. If there are
          no additional items to return, the string is empty.
