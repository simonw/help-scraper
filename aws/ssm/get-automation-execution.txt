NAME
       get-automation-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Get detailed information about a particular Automation execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-automation-execution
          --automation-execution-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --automation-execution-id (string)
          The  unique identifier for an existing automation execution to exam-
          ine. The execution ID is returned by  StartAutomationExecution  when
          the execution of an Automation runbook is initiated.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 IsCritical -> (boolean)
                     The  flag  which  can  be used to help decide whether the
                     failure of current step leads to the Automation failure.

                 ValidNextSteps -> (list)
                     Strategies used when step fails, we support Continue  and
                     Abort.  Abort  will  fail  the  automation  when the step
                     fails. Continue will ignore the failure of  current  step
                     and  allow  automation  to run the next step. With condi-
                     tional branching, we add step:stepName to support the au-
                     tomation to go to another specific step.

                     (structure)
                        An array of search criteria that targets managed nodes
                        using a key-value pair that you specify.

                        NOTE:
                            One or more targets must be specified for  mainte-

                            the task, targets are optional for  other  mainte-

                     User-defined  criteria that maps to Key . For example, if

                     value:WebServer  to  run  a command on instances that in-
                     clude EC2 tags of ServerRole,WebServer .

                     Depending on the type of target, the  maximum  number  of
