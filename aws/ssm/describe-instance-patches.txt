DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCHES()                        DESCRIBE-INSTANCE-PATCHES()



NAME
       describe-instance-patches -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  information  about the patches on the specified managed node
       and their state relative to the patch baseline being used for the node.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-instance-patches is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: Patches

SYNOPSIS
            describe-instance-patches
          --instance-id <value>
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]

OPTIONS
       --instance-id (string)
          The  ID  of the managed node whose patch state information should be
          retrieved.

       --filters (list)
          Each element in the array is  a  structure  containing  a  key-value
          pair.

          Supported keys for DescribeInstancePatches include the following:

          o

            **
            Classification **   Sample values: Security | SecurityUpdates

          System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 72)

            Inline strong start-string without end-string.

          (structure)
              Defines a filter used in Patch Manager  APIs.  Supported  filter
              keys depend on the API operation that includes the filter. Patch
              Manager API operations that use PatchOrchestratorFilter  include
              the following:

              o DescribeAvailablePatches

              o DescribeInstancePatches

              o DescribePatchBaselines

              o DescribePatchGroups

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The value for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
