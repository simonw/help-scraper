NAME
       create-ops-item -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a new OpsItem. You must have permission in Identity and Access
       Management (IAM) to create a new OpsItem.  For  more  information,  see
       Getting  started with OpsCenter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Man-
       ager User Guide .

       Operations engineers and IT professionals use Amazon Web Services  Sys-
       tems  Manager OpsCenter to view, investigate, and remediate operational
       issues impacting the performance and health of their  Amazon  Web  Ser-
       vices  resources. For more information, see Amazon Web Services Systems
       Manager OpsCenter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide

OPTIONS
       --description (string)
          Information about the OpsItem.

       --ops-item-type (string)
          The  type of OpsItem to create. Currently, the only valid values are
          /aws/changerequest and /aws/issue .

       --operational-data (map)
          Operational data is custom data that provides useful  reference  de-
          tails about the OpsItem. For example, you can specify log files, er-
          ror strings, license keys, troubleshooting tips, or  other  relevant
          data.  You  enter operational data as key-value pairs. The key has a
          maximum length of 128 characters. The value has a maximum size of 20
          KB.

          WARNING:
              Operational  data  keys can't begin with the following: amazon ,
              aws , amzn , ssm , /amazon , /aws , /amzn , /ssm .

          You can choose to make the data searchable by other users in the ac-
          count  or you can restrict search access. Searchable data means that
          all users with access to the OpsItem Overview page (as  provided  by
          the   DescribeOpsItems  API  operation)  can  view and search on the
          specified data. Operational data that isn't searchable is only view-
          able  by  users  who  have access to the OpsItem (as provided by the
          GetOpsItem API operation).

          Use the /aws/resources key in OperationalData to specify  a  related
          resource  in  the  request.  Use  the /aws/automations key in Opera-
          tionalData to associate an Automation runbook with the  OpsItem.  To
          view  Amazon  Web Services CLI example commands that use these keys,
          see Creating OpsItems manually in the Amazon  Web  Services  Systems
          Manager User Guide .

          tags.  For  more  information, see Getting started with OpsCenter in
          the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide .

          Tags use a key-value pair. For example:
              Key=Department,Value=Finance

          WARNING:
              To add tags to a new OpsItem, a user must have  IAM  permissions
              for  both  the  ssm:CreateOpsItems operation and the ssm:AddTag-
              sToResource operation. To add tags to an existing  OpsItem,  use
              the  AddTagsToResource operation.

          (structure)
              Metadata  that you assign to your Amazon Web Services resources.
              Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different  ways,
              for  example,  by  purpose, owner, or environment. In Amazon Web
              Services Systems Manager, you can apply tags to Systems  Manager
              documents  (SSM  documents), managed nodes, maintenance windows,
              parameters, patch baselines, OpsItems, and OpsMetadata.

              Key -> (string)
                 The name of the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --category (string)
          Specify a category to assign to an OpsItem.

       --severity (string)
          Specify a severity to assign to an OpsItem.

       --actual-start-time (timestamp)
          The time a runbook workflow started. Currently reported only for the
          OpsItem type /aws/changerequest .

       --actual-end-time (timestamp)
          The  time  a runbook workflow ended. Currently reported only for the
          OpsItem type /aws/changerequest .

       --planned-start-time (timestamp)
          The time specified in a change request for  a  runbook  workflow  to
          start.  Currently  supported  only  for the OpsItem type /aws/chang-
          erequest .

       --planned-end-time (timestamp)
          The time specified in a change request for  a  runbook  workflow  to
          end.  Currently  supported  only  for  the  OpsItem type /aws/chang-
          erequest .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       To create an OpsItems

       The following create-ops-item example uses the  /aws/resources  key  in
       OperationalData  to  create  an OpsItem with an Amazon DynamoDB related
       resource.

          aws ssm create-ops-item \
              --title "EC2 instance disk full" \
              --description "Log clean up may have failed which caused the disk to be full" \
              --priority 2 \
              --source ec2 \
              --operational-data '{"/aws/resources":{"Value":"[{\"arn\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:12345678:table/OpsItems\"}]","Type":"SearchableString"}}' \
              --notifications Arn="arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:12345678:TestUser"

       Output:

          {
              "OpsItemId": "oi-1a2b3c4d5e6f"
          }

OUTPUT
       OpsItemId -> (string)
