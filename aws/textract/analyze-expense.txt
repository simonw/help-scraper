ANALYZE-EXPENSE()                                            ANALYZE-EXPENSE()



NAME
       analyze-expense -

DESCRIPTION
          AnalyzeExpense  synchronously  analyzes an input document for finan-
          cially related relationships between text.

       Information is returned as ExpenseDocuments and seperated as follows.

       o LineItemGroups - A data set containing LineItems which store informa-
         tion about the lines of text, such as an item purchased and its price
         on a receipt.

       o SummaryFields - Contains all other information  a  receipt,  such  as
         header information or the vendors name.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            analyze-expense
          --document <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document (structure)
          The input document, either as bytes or as an S3 object.

          You  pass  image  bytes to an Amazon Textract API operation by using
          the Bytes property. For example, you would use the Bytes property to
          pass  a document loaded from a local file system. Image bytes passed
          by using the Bytes property must be base64 encoded. Your code  might
          not need to encode document file bytes if you're using an AWS SDK to
          call Amazon Textract API operations.

          You pass images stored in an S3 bucket to an Amazon Textract API op-
          eration  by  using  the S3Object property. Documents stored in an S3
          bucket don't need to be base64 encoded.

          The AWS Region for the S3 bucket that contains the  S3  object  must
          match the AWS Region that you use for Amazon Textract operations.

          If  you  use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Textract operations, passing
          image bytes using the Bytes property isn't supported. You must first
          upload the document to an Amazon S3 bucket, and then call the opera-
          tion using the S3Object property.

          For Amazon Textract to process an S3 object, the user must have per-
          mission to access the S3 object.

          Bytes -> (blob)
              A  blob  of base64-encoded document bytes. The maximum size of a
              document that's provided in a blob of bytes is 5 MB.  The  docu-
              ment bytes must be in PNG or JPEG format.

              If  you're  using  an AWS SDK to call Amazon Textract, you might
              not need to base64-encode image bytes  passed  using  the  Bytes
              field.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              Identifies an S3 object as the document source. The maximum size
              of a document that's stored in an S3 bucket is 5 MB.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Bytes=blob,S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Bytes": blob,
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                            tion elements.
