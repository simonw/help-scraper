GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()                                  GET-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       get-expense-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that an-
       alyzes invoices and receipts. Amazon Textract  finds  contact  informa-
       tion,  items  purchased,  and  vendor name, from input invoices and re-
       ceipts.

       You start asynchronous invoice/receipt analysis  by  calling   StartEx-
       penseAnalysis  ,  which returns a job identifier (JobId ). Upon comple-
       tion of the invoice/receipt analysis,  Amazon  Textract  publishes  the
       completion  status  to  the  Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon
       SNS) topic. This topic must be registered in the initial call to Start-
       ExpenseAnalysis  .  To  get the results of the invoice/receipt analysis
       operation, first ensure that the status value published to  the  Amazon
       SNS  topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call GetExpenseAnalysis , and pass the
       job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call to StartExpenseAnalysis .

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are re-
       turned.  If  there  are more results than specified in MaxResults , the
       value of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination  to-
       ken  for  getting  the next set of results. To get the next page of re-
       sults, call GetExpenseAnalysis , and populate the NextToken request pa-
       rameter  with the token value that's returned from the previous call to
       GetExpenseAnalysis .

SYNOPSIS
            get-expense-analysis
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A unique identifier for the text detection job.  The  JobId  is  re-
          turned from StartExpenseAnalysis . A JobId value is only valid for 7
          days.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to  return  per  paginated  call.  The
          largest  value you can specify is 20. If you specify a value greater
          than 20, a maximum of 20 results is returned. The default  value  is
          20.

       --next-token (string)
          If  the  previous  response  was  incomplete (because there are more
          blocks to retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination  token  in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of blocks.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentMetadata -> (structure)
          Information about a document that Amazon Textract  processed.  Docu-
          mentMetadata  is  returned in every page of paginated responses from
          an Amazon Textract operation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the response is truncated, Amazon Textract  returns  this  token.
          You  can  use  this  token in the subsequent request to retrieve the
          next set of text-detection results.
