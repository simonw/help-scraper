START-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()                              START-EXPENSE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       start-expense-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts  the asynchronous analysis of invoices or receipts for data like
       contact information, items purchased, and vendor names.
          StartExpenseAnalysis can analyze text in documents that are in JPEG,
          PNG,  and  PDF  format. The documents must be stored in an Amazon S3
          bucket. Use the  DocumentLocation parameter to specify the  name  of
          your S3 bucket and the name of the document in that bucket.

          StartExpenseAnalysis returns a job identifier (JobId ) that you will
          provide to GetExpenseAnalysis to retrieve the results of the  opera-
          tion.  When the analysis of the input invoices/receipts is finished,
          Amazon Textract publishes a completion status to the  Amazon  Simple
          Notification  Service (Amazon SNS) topic that you provide to the No-
          tificationChannel . To obtain the results of the invoice and receipt
          analysis  operation,  ensure  that the status value published to the
          Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If so,  call   GetExpenseAnalysis  ,
          and  pass the job identifier (JobId ) that was returned by your call
          to StartExpenseAnalysis .

SYNOPSIS
            start-expense-analysis
          --document-location <value>
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--job-tag <value>]
          [--notification-channel <value>]
          [--output-config <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --document-location (structure)
          The location of the document to be processed.

          S3Object -> (structure)
              The Amazon S3 bucket that contains the input document.

              Bucket -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket. Note that the # character  is  not
                 valid in the file name.

              Name -> (string)
                 The  file  name of the input document. Synchronous operations
                 can use image files that are in JPEG or PNG format. Asynchro-
                 nous operations also support PDF and TIFF format files.

              Version -> (string)
                 If the bucket has versioning enabled, you can specify the ob-
                 ject version.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Object={Bucket=string,Name=string,Version=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Object": {
              "Bucket": "string",
              "Name": "string",
              "Version": "string"
            }
          }

       --client-request-token (string)
          The idempotent token that's used to identify the start  request.  If
          you  use the same token with multiple StartDocumentTextDetection re-
          quests, the same JobId is returned. Use ClientRequestToken  to  pre-
          vent  the  same  job from being accidentally started more than once.
          For more information, see Calling Amazon Textract Asynchronous Oper-
          ations

       --job-tag (string)
          An  identifier you specify that's included in the completion notifi-
          cation published to the Amazon SNS topic. For example, you  can  use
          JobTag  to identify the type of document that the completion notifi-
          cation corresponds to (such as a tax form or a receipt).

       --notification-channel (structure)
          The Amazon SNS topic ARN that you want Amazon  Textract  to  publish
          the completion status of the operation to.

          SNSTopicArn -> (string)
              The  Amazon  SNS topic that Amazon Textract posts the completion
              status to.

          RoleArn -> (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that gives  Amazon
              Textract publishing permissions to the Amazon SNS topic.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SNSTopicArn=string,RoleArn=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SNSTopicArn": "string",
            "RoleArn": "string"
          }

       --output-config (structure)
          Sets if the output will go to a customer defined bucket. By default,
          Amazon Textract will save the results internally to be  accessed  by
          the GetExpenseAnalysis operation.

          S3Bucket -> (string)
              The name of the bucket your output will go to.

          S3Prefix -> (string)
              The  prefix  of the object key that the output will be saved to.
              When not enabled, the prefix will be textract_output".

       Shorthand Syntax:

          S3Bucket=string,S3Prefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "S3Bucket": "string",
            "S3Prefix": "string"
          }

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The KMS key used to encrypt the inference results. This  can  be  in
          either  Key  ID or Key Alias format. When a KMS key is provided, the
          KMS key will be used for server-side encryption of  the  objects  in
          the  customer bucket. When this parameter is not enabled, the result
          will be encrypted server side,using SSE-S3.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       JobId -> (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the text detection job. The JobId is re-
          turned from StartExpenseAnalysis . A JobId value is only valid for 7
          days.
