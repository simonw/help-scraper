GET-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()                                GET-DOCUMENT-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       get-document-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets the results for an Amazon Textract asynchronous operation that an-
       alyzes text in a document.

       You start asynchronous text analysis by calling   StartDocumentAnalysis
       , which returns a job identifier (JobId ). When the text analysis oper-
       ation finishes, Amazon Textract publishes a completion  status  to  the
       Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that's registered
       in the initial call to StartDocumentAnalysis . To get  the  results  of
       the  text-detection  operation,  first check that the status value pub-
       lished to the Amazon SNS topic is SUCCEEDED . If so, call  GetDocument-
       Analysis  ,  and pass the job identifier (JobId ) from the initial call
       to StartDocumentAnalysis .
          GetDocumentAnalysis returns an array of  Block objects. The  follow-
          ing types of information are returned:

       o Form  data  (key-value pairs). The related information is returned in
         two  Block objects, each of type KEY_VALUE_SET : a KEY  Block  object
         and  a VALUE Block object. For example, Name: Ana Silva Carolina con-
         tains a key and value. Name: is the key. Ana Silva  Carolina  is  the
         value.

       o Table  and table cell data. A TABLE Block object contains information
         about a detected table. A CELL Block object is returned for each cell
         in a table.

       o Lines  and  words  of  text. A LINE Block object contains one or more
         WORD Block objects. All lines and words that are detected in the doc-
         ument  are  returned (including text that doesn't have a relationship
         with the value of the StartDocumentAnalysis  FeatureTypes  input  pa-
         rameter).

       o Queries.  A  QUERIES_RESULT  Block  object contains the answer to the
         query, the alias associated and an ID that connect it  to  the  query
         asked.  This  Block  also contains a location and attached confidence
         score

       Selection elements such as check boxes and option buttons  (radio  but-
       tons)  can  be detected in form data and in tables. A SELECTION_ELEMENT
       Block object contains information about a selection element,  including
       the selection status.

       Use the MaxResults parameter to limit the number of blocks that are re-
       turned. If there are more results than specified in  MaxResults  ,  the
       value  of NextToken in the operation response contains a pagination to-
       ken for getting the next set of results. To get the next  page  of  re-
       sults,  call  GetDocumentAnalysis  , and populate the NextToken request
       parameter with the token value that's returned from the  previous  call
       to GetDocumentAnalysis .

SYNOPSIS
            get-document-analysis
          --job-id <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --job-id (string)
          A  unique  identifier  for  the text-detection job. The JobId is re-
          turned from StartDocumentAnalysis . A JobId value is only valid  for
          7 days.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of  results  to return per paginated call. The
          largest value that you can specify is 1,000. If you specify a  value
          greater  than 1,000, a maximum of 1,000 results is returned. The de-
          fault value is 1,000.

       --next-token (string)
          If the previous response was  incomplete  (because  there  are  more
          blocks  to  retrieve), Amazon Textract returns a pagination token in
          the response. You can use this pagination token to retrieve the next
          set of blocks.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       DocumentMetadata -> (structure)
          Information  about  a document that Amazon Textract processed. Docu-
          mentMetadata is returned in every page of paginated  responses  from
          an Amazon Textract video operation.

          Pages -> (integer)
              The number of pages that are detected in the document.

       JobStatus -> (string)
          The current status of the text detection job.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  response  is truncated, Amazon Textract returns this token.
          You can use this token in the subsequent  request  to  retrieve  the
          next set of text detection results.

       Blocks -> (list)
          The results of the text-analysis operation.

          (structure)
              A  Block  represents  items  that  are  recognized in a document
              within a group of pixels close to each  other.  The  information
              returned  in a Block object depends on the type of operation. In
              text detection for documents (for example  DetectDocumentText ),
              you  get information about the detected words and lines of text.
              In text analysis (for example  AnalyzeDocument ), you  can  also
              get information about the fields, tables, and selection elements
              that are detected in the document.

              An array of Block objects is returned by  both  synchronous  and
              asynchronous operations. In synchronous operations, such as  De-
              tectDocumentText , the array of Block objects is the entire  set
              of  results.  In  asynchronous operations, such as  GetDocument-
              Analysis , the array is returned over one or more responses.

              For more information, see How Amazon Textract Works .

              BlockType -> (string)
                 The type of text item that's recognized.  In  operations  for
                 text detection, the following types are returned:

                 o PAGE  -  Contains a list of the LINE Block objects that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 o WORD - A word detected on a document page. A word is one or
                   more  ISO  basic  Latin script characters that aren't sepa-
                   rated by spaces.

                 o LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 In  text  analysis  operations,  the  following types are re-
                 turned:

                 o PAGE - Contains a list of child Block objects that are  de-
                   tected on a document page.

                 o KEY_VALUE_SET  - Stores the KEY and VALUE Block objects for
                   linked text that's detected on a document page. Use the En-
                   tityType  field to determine if a KEY_VALUE_SET object is a
                   KEY Block object or a VALUE Block object.

                 o WORD - A word that's detected on a document page. A word is
                   one  or  more ISO basic Latin script characters that aren't
                   separated by spaces.

                 o LINE - A string of tab-delimited, contiguous words that are
                   detected on a document page.

                 o TABLE - A table that's detected on a document page. A table
                   is grid-based information with two or more rows or columns,
                   with a cell span of one row and one column each.

                 o CELL - A cell within a detected table. The cell is the par-
                   ent of the block that contains the text in the cell.

                 o SELECTION_ELEMENT - A selection element such as  an  option
                   button  (radio  button) or a check box that's detected on a
                   document page. Use the value of SelectionStatus  to  deter-
                   mine the status of the selection element.

                 o QUERY  -  A  question asked during the call of AnalyzeDocu-
                   ment. Contains an alias and an ID that attachs  it  to  its
                   answer.

                 o QUERY_RESULT  -  A  response to a question asked during the
                   call of analyze document. Comes with an alias  and  ID  for
                   ease  of locating in a response. Also contains location and
                   confidence score.

              Confidence -> (float)
                 The confidence score that Amazon Textract has in the accuracy
                 of  the  recognized  text  and  the  accuracy of the geometry
                 points around the recognized text.

              Text -> (string)
                 The word or line of text that's  recognized  by  Amazon  Tex-
                 tract.

              TextType -> (string)
                 The kind of text that Amazon Textract has detected. Can check
                 for handwritten text and printed text.

              RowIndex -> (integer)
                 The row in which a table cell is located. The first row posi-
                 tion  is 1. RowIndex isn't returned by DetectDocumentText and
                 GetDocumentTextDetection .

              ColumnIndex -> (integer)
                 The column in which a table cell appears.  The  first  column
                 position  is 1. ColumnIndex isn't returned by DetectDocument-
                 Text and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              RowSpan -> (integer)
                 The number of rows that a table cell  spans.  Currently  this
                 value  is  always  1,  even  if the number of rows spanned is
                 greater than 1. RowSpan isn't returned by  DetectDocumentText
                 and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              ColumnSpan -> (integer)
                 The number of columns that a table cell spans. Currently this
                 value is always 1, even if the number of columns  spanned  is
                 greater  than 1. ColumnSpan isn't returned by DetectDocument-
                 Text and GetDocumentTextDetection .

              Geometry -> (structure)
                 The location of the recognized text on the image. It includes
                 an axis-aligned, coarse bounding box that surrounds the text,
                 and a finer-grain polygon for more accurate spatial  informa-
                 tion.

                 BoundingBox -> (structure)
                     An  axis-aligned coarse representation of the location of
                     the recognized item on the document page.

                     Width -> (float)
                        The width of the bounding box as a ratio of the  over-
                        all document page width.

                     Height -> (float)
                        The height of the bounding box as a ratio of the over-
                        all document page height.

                     Left -> (float)
                        The left coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio  of
                        overall document page width.

                     Top -> (float)
                        The  top  coordinate of the bounding box as a ratio of
                        overall document page height.

                 Polygon -> (list)
                     Within the bounding box, a  fine-grained  polygon  around
                     the recognized item.

                     (structure)
                        The X and Y coordinates of a point on a document page.
                        The X and Y values that are returned are ratios of the
                        overall  document page size. For example, if the input
                        document is 700 x 200 and the operation returns  X=0.5
                        and  Y=0.25,  then  the point is at the (350,50) pixel
                        coordinate on the document page.

                        An array of Point objects, Polygon ,  is  returned  by
                        DetectDocumentText . Polygon represents a fine-grained
                        polygon around detected text.  For  more  information,
                        see Geometry in the Amazon Textract Developer Guide.

                        X -> (float)
                            The  value  of  the  X coordinate for a point on a
                            Polygon .

                        Y -> (float)
                            The value of the Y coordinate for  a  point  on  a
                            Polygon .

              Id -> (string)
                 The  identifier  for  the  recognized text. The identifier is
                 only unique for a single operation.

              Relationships -> (list)
                 A list of child blocks of the current block. For  example,  a
                 LINE  object has child blocks for each WORD block that's part
                 of the line of text. There aren't Relationship objects in the
                 list  for  relationships  that  don't exist, such as when the
                 current block has no child blocks. The list size can  be  the
                 following:

                 o 0 - The block has no child blocks.

                 o 1 - The block has child blocks.

                 (structure)
                     Information about how blocks are related to each other. A
                     Block object contains 0 or more  Relation  objects  in  a
                     list, Relationships . For more information, see  Block .

                     The  Type  element  provides the type of the relationship
                     for all blocks in the IDs array.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The type of relationship that the blocks  in  the  IDs
                        array  have  with  the current block. The relationship
                        can be VALUE or CHILD . A relationship of  type  VALUE
                        is  a  list  that  contains  the ID of the VALUE block
                        that's associated with the KEY of a key-value pair.  A
                        relationship of type CHILD is a list of IDs that iden-
                        tify WORD blocks in the case of lines Cell  blocks  in
                        the case of Tables, and WORD blocks in the case of Se-
                        lection Elements.

                     Ids -> (list)
                        An array of IDs for related blocks. You  can  get  the
                        type of the relationship from the Type element.

                        (string)

              EntityTypes -> (list)
                 The type of entity. The following can be returned:

                 o KEY - An identifier for a field on the document.

                 o VALUE - The field text.
                     EntityTypes isn't returned by DetectDocumentText and Get-
                     DocumentTextDetection .

                 (string)

              SelectionStatus -> (string)
                 The selection status of a selection element, such as  an  op-
                 tion button or check box.

              Page -> (integer)
                 The  page  on which a block was detected. Page is returned by
                 asynchronous operations. Page values greater than 1 are  only
                 returned for multipage documents that are in PDF or TIFF for-
                 mat. A scanned image (JPEG/PNG), even if it contains multiple
                 document  pages,  is considered to be a single-page document.
                 The value of Page is always 1. Synchronous  operations  don't
                 return  Page because every input document is considered to be
                 a single-page document.

              Query -> (structure)
                 Text -> (string)
                     Question that Amazon Textract will apply to the document.
                     An example would be "What is the customer's SSN?"

                 Alias -> (string)
                     Alias attached to the query, for ease of location.

                 Pages -> (list)
                     List of pages associated with the query. The following is
                     a list of rules for using this parameter.

                     o If a page is not specified, it is set to ["1"]  by  de-
                       fault.

                     o The following characters are allowed in the parameter's
                       string: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - * . No whitespace is  al-
                       lowed.

                     o When using * to indicate all pages, it must be the only
                       element in the string.

                     o You can use page intervals, such as [1-3, 1-1,  4-*]  .
                       Where * indicates last page of document.

                     o Specified pages must be greater than 0 and less than or
                       equal to the number of pages in the document.
