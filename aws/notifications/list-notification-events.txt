LIST-NOTIFICATION-EVENTS()                          LIST-NOTIFICATION-EVENTS()



NAME
       list-notification-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of NotificationEvents according to specified filters, in
       reverse chronological order (newest first).

       WARNING:
          User Notifications stores notifications in  the  individual  Regions
          you register as notification hubs and the Region of the source event
          rule. ListNotificationEvents only returns  notifications  stored  in
          the  same  Region  in which the action is called. User Notifications
          doesn't backfill notifications to new Regions selected as  notifica-
          tion hubs. For this reason, we recommend that you make calls in your
          oldest  registered  notification  hub.  For  more  information,  see
          Notification hubs in the AWS User Notifications User Guide .

       list-notification-events  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: notificationEvents

OPTIONS
       --start-time (timestamp)
          The earliest time of events to return from this call.

       --end-time (timestamp)
          Latest time of events to return from this call.

       --locale (string)
          The locale code of the language used for the retrieved Notification-
          Event. The default locale is English (en_US) .

          Possible values:

          o de_DE

          o en_CA

          o en_US

          o en_UK

          o es_ES

          o fr_CA

          o fr_FR

          o id_ID

          o it_IT

          o ja_JP

          o ko_KR

          o pt_BR

          o tr_TR

          o zh_CN

          o zh_TW

       --source (string)
          The matched event source.

          Must  match  one  of the valid EventBridge sources. Only AWS service
          sourced events are supported. For example,  aws.ec2  and  aws.cloud-
          watch  .  For more information, see Event delivery from AWS services
          in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide .

       --include-child-events | --no-include-child-events (boolean)
          Include aggregated child events in the result.

       --aggregate-notification-event-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the aggregatedNotificationEventArn
          to match.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.
