LIST-CERTIFICATES()                                        LIST-CERTIFICATES()



NAME
       list-certificates -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  a list of certificate ARNs and domain names. By default, the
       API returns RSA_2048 certificates. To return all  certificates  in  the
       account,   include  the  keyType  filter  with  the  values  [RSA_1024,
       RSA_2048,    RSA_3072,    RSA_4096,    EC_prime256v1,     EC_secp384r1,
       EC_secp521r1] .

       In addition to keyType , you can also filter by the CertificateStatuses
       , keyUsage , and extendedKeyUsage attributes on  the  certificate.  For
       more information, see  Filters .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-certificates  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: CertificateSummaryList

OPTIONS
       --certificate-statuses (list)
          Filter the certificate list by status value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            PENDING_VALIDATION
            ISSUED
            INACTIVE
            EXPIRED
            VALIDATION_TIMED_OUT
            REVOKED
            FAILED

       --includes (structure)
          Filter the certificate list. For more information, see the   Filters
          structure.

          extendedKeyUsage -> (list)
              Specify one or more  ExtendedKeyUsage extension values.

              (string)

          keyUsage -> (list)
              Specify one or more  KeyUsage extension values.

              (string)

          keyTypes -> (list)
              Specify  one or more algorithms that can be used to generate key
              pairs.

              Default filtering returns only RSA_1024  and  RSA_2048  certifi-
              cates that have at least one domain. To return other certificate
              types, provide the desired type signatures in a  comma-separated
              list.  For  example, "keyTypes": ["RSA_2048","RSA_4096"] returns
              both RSA_2048 and RSA_4096 certificates.

              (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          extendedKeyUsage=string,string,keyUsage=string,string,keyTypes=string,string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "extendedKeyUsage": ["TLS_WEB_SERVER_AUTHENTICATION"|"TLS_WEB_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION"|"CODE_SIGNING"|"EMAIL_PROTECTION"|"TIME_STAMPING"|"OCSP_SIGNING"|"IPSEC_END_SYSTEM"|"IPSEC_TUNNEL"|"IPSEC_USER"|"ANY"|"NONE"|"CUSTOM", ...],
            "keyUsage": ["DIGITAL_SIGNATURE"|"NON_REPUDIATION"|"KEY_ENCIPHERMENT"|"DATA_ENCIPHERMENT"|"KEY_AGREEMENT"|"CERTIFICATE_SIGNING"|"CRL_SIGNING"|"ENCIPHER_ONLY"|"DECIPHER_ONLY"|"ANY"|"CUSTOM", ...],
            "keyTypes": ["RSA_1024"|"RSA_2048"|"RSA_3072"|"RSA_4096"|"EC_prime256v1"|"EC_secp384r1"|"EC_secp521r1", ...]
          }

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --sort-by (string)
          Specifies the field to sort results by. If you specify SortBy ,  you
          must also specify SortOrder .

          Possible values:

          o CREATED_AT

       --sort-order (string)
          Specifies  the  order  of sorted results. If you specify SortOrder ,
          you must also specify SortBy .

          Possible values:

          o ASCENDING

          o DESCENDING

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the ACM certificates for an AWS account

       The  following list-certificates command lists the ARNs of the certifi-
       cates in your account:

          aws acm list-certificates

       The preceding command produces output similar to the following:

          {
              "CertificateSummaryList": [
                  {
                      "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
                      "DomainName": "www.example.com"
                  },
                  {
                      "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee",
                      "DomainName": "www.example.net"
                  }
              ]
          }

       You can decide how many certificates you want to display each time  you
       call  list-certificates. For example, if you have four certificates and
       you want to display no more than two at a time, set the max-items argu-
       ment to 2 as in the following example:

          aws acm list-certificates --max-items 2

       Two certificate ARNs and a NextToken value will be displayed:

          "CertificateSummaryList": [
            {
              "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:region:account: \
                      certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012",
              "DomainName": "www.example.com"
            },
            {
              "CertificateArn": "arn:aws:acm:region:account: \
                       certificate/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee",
              "DomainName": "www.example.net"
            }
            ],
              "NextToken": "9f4d9f69-275a-41fe-b58e-2b837bd9ba48"

       To  display the next two certificates in your account, set this NextTo-
       ken value in your next call:

          aws acm list-certificates --max-items 2 --next-token 9f4d9f69-275a-41fe-b58e-2b837bd9ba48

       You can filter your output by using the certificate-statuses  argument.
       The following command displays certificates that have a PENDING_VALIDA-
       TION status:

          aws acm list-certificates --certificate-statuses PENDING_VALIDATION

       You can also filter your output by using  the  includes  argument.  The
       following command displays certificates filtered on the following prop-
       erties. The certificates to be displayed:

          - Specify that the RSA algorithm and a 2048 bit key are used to generate key pairs.
          - Contain a Key Usage extension that specifies that the certificates can be used to create digital signatures.
          - Contain an Extended Key Usage extension that specifies that the certificates can be used for code signing.

          aws acm list-certificates --max-items 10 --includes extendedKeyUsage=CODE_SIGNING,keyUsage=DIGITAL_SIGNATURE,keyTypes=RSA_2048

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and  contains  the
          value  to use for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination
          request.

       CertificateSummaryList -> (list)
          A list of ACM certificates.

          (structure)
              This structure is returned in the response object  of   ListCer-
              tificates action.

              CertificateArn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the certificate. This is of the
                 form:
                     arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
                     cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

                 For  more  information  about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names
                 (ARNs) .

              DomainName -> (string)
                 Fully qualified domain name (FQDN), such  as  www.example.com
                 or example.com, for the certificate.

              SubjectAlternativeNameSummaries -> (list)
                 One or more domain names (subject alternative names) included
                 in the certificate. This list contains the domain names  that
                 are bound to the public key that is contained in the certifi-
                 cate. The subject alternative names include the canonical do-
                 main name (CN) of the certificate and additional domain names
                 that can be used to connect to the website.

                 When called by  ListCertificates , this parameter  will  only
                 return  the  first  100 subject alternative names included in
                 the certificate. To display the full list of subject alterna-
                 tive names, use  DescribeCertificate .

                 (string)

              HasAdditionalSubjectAlternativeNames -> (boolean)
                 When called by  ListCertificates , indicates whether the full
                 list of subject alternative names has been  included  in  the
                 response.  If false, the response includes all of the subject
                 alternative names included in the certificate. If  true,  the
                 response  only  includes  the  first  100 subject alternative
                 names included in the certificate. To display the  full  list
                 of subject alternative names, use  DescribeCertificate .

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the certificate.

                 A certificate enters status PENDING_VALIDATION upon being re-
                 quested, unless it fails for any of the reasons given in  the
                 troubleshooting  topic  Certificate request fails . ACM makes
                 repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours  and
                 then times out. If a certificate shows status FAILED or VALI-
                 DATION_TIMED_OUT, delete the request, correct the issue  with
                 DNS  validation or Email validation , and try again. If vali-
                 dation succeeds, the certificate enters status ISSUED.

              Type -> (string)
                 The source of the certificate. For certificates  provided  by
                 ACM,  this value is AMAZON_ISSUED . For certificates that you
                 imported with  ImportCertificate , this value is  IMPORTED  .
                 ACM  does  not  provide managed renewal for imported certifi-
                 cates. For more information  about  the  differences  between
                 certificates that you import and those that ACM provides, see
                 Importing Certificates in the Certificate Manager User  Guide
                 .

              KeyAlgorithm -> (string)
                 The  algorithm  that  was used to generate the public-private
                 key pair.

              KeyUsages -> (list)
                 A list of Key Usage X.509 v3 extension objects.  Each  object
                 is  a  string value that identifies the purpose of the public
                 key contained in the certificate. Possible  extension  values
                 include  DIGITAL_SIGNATURE,  KEY_ENCHIPHERMENT,  NON_REPUDIA-
                 TION, and more.

                 (string)

              ExtendedKeyUsages -> (list)
                 Contains a list of Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension  ob-
                 jects. Each object specifies a purpose for which the certifi-
                 cate public key can be used and consists of a name and an ob-
                 ject identifier (OID).

                 (string)

              InUse -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  whether the certificate is currently in use by any
                 Amazon Web Services resources.

              Exported -> (boolean)
                 Indicates whether the certificate  has  been  exported.  This
                 value exists only when the certificate type is PRIVATE .

              RenewalEligibility -> (string)
                 Specifies whether the certificate is eligible for renewal. At
                 this time, only exported private certificates can be  renewed
                 with the  RenewCertificate command.

              NotBefore -> (timestamp)
                 The time before which the certificate is not valid.

              NotAfter -> (timestamp)
                 The time after which the certificate is not valid.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the certificate was requested.

              IssuedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The  time at which the certificate was issued. This value ex-
                 ists only when the certificate type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

              ImportedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the  certificate  was  imported.  This
                 value exists only when the certificate type is IMPORTED .

              RevokedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the certificate was revoked. This value ex-
                 ists only when the certificate status is REVOKED .
