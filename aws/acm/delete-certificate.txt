DELETE-CERTIFICATE()                                      DELETE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       delete-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  certificate  and its associated private key. If this action
       succeeds, the certificate no longer appears in the  list  that  can  be
       displayed  by  calling  the  ListCertificates action or be retrieved by
       calling the  GetCertificate action. The certificate will not be  avail-
       able for use by Amazon Web Services services integrated with ACM.

       NOTE:
          You  cannot  delete an ACM certificate that is being used by another
          Amazon Web Services service. To delete a certificate that is in use,
          the certificate association must first be removed.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          String  that  contains the ARN of the ACM certificate to be deleted.
          This must be of the form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The  following  delete-certificate command deletes the certificate with
       the specified ARN:

          aws acm delete-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

OUTPUT
       None
