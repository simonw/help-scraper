DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()                                  DESCRIBE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       describe-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns detailed metadata about the specified ACM certificate.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificate
          --certificate-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACM certificate. The ARN must
          have the following form:
              arn:aws:acm:region:123456789012:certifi-
              cate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

          For more information about ARNs, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the fields contained in an ACM certificate

       The following describe-certificate command retrieves all of the  fields
       for the certificate with the specified ARN:

          aws acm describe-certificate --certificate-arn arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:123456789012:certificate/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

       Output similar to the following is displayed:

              name that occurs as a result of the  RequestCertificate request.
              This  field  exists only when the certificate type is AMAZON_IS-
              SUED .

              (structure)
                 Contains information about the validation of each domain name

                     o SUCCESS

                     o FAILED

                 ResourceRecord -> (structure)

                     DNS to Validate Domain Ownership .

                     Note:  The  CNAME  information that you need does not in-
                     clude the name of your domain. If you include your domain
                     name  in the DNS database CNAME record, validation fails.

              The status of the certificate.

          RevokedAt -> (timestamp)

          FailureReason -> (string)
              The  reason  the  certificate  request failed. This value exists
              only when the certificate status is FAILED . For  more  informa-

          Type -> (string)
              The source of the certificate. For certificates provided by ACM,
              this value is AMAZON_ISSUED . For certificates that you imported
              with  ImportCertificate , this value is IMPORTED . ACM does  not
              provide  managed renewal for imported certificates. For more in-
              formation about the differences between  certificates  that  you
              import  and  those that ACM provides, see Importing Certificates

                 in the certificate, as it pertains to ACM's managed renewal .
                 This is different from the initial validation that occurs  as
                 a  result  of the  RequestCertificate request. This field ex-
                 ists only when the certificate type is AMAZON_ISSUED .

                 (structure)
                     Contains information about the validation of each  domain
                     name in the certificate.

                     ValidationStatus -> (string)
                        The validation status of the domain name. This can  be
                        one of the following values:

                        o PENDING_VALIDATION

                        clude the name of your domain. If you include your do-
                        main name in the DNS database CNAME record, validation
                        fails.    For    example,    if    the     name     is
                        "_a79865eb4cd1a6ab990a45779b4e0b96.yourdomain.com",

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value of the CNAME record to add to  your  DNS

              string value that identifies the purpose of the public key  con-
              tained  in  the  certificate.  Possible extension values include
              DIGITAL_SIGNATURE, KEY_ENCHIPHERMENT, NON_REPUDIATION, and more.

              (structure)
                 The Key Usage X.509 v3 extension defines the purpose  of  the
                 public key contained in the certificate.

                 Name -> (string)
                     A string value that contains a Key Usage extension name.

                 The Extended Key Usage X.509 v3 extension defines one or more
                 purposes for which the public key can be used. This is in ad-
                 dition to or in place of the basic purposes specified by  the
                 Key Usage extension.

                 Name -> (string)
                     The name of an Extended Key Usage value.

                 OID -> (string)
                     An  object identifier (OID) for the extension value. OIDs
                     are strings of numbers separated by periods. The  follow-
                     ing OIDs are defined in RFC 3280 and RFC 5280.

              cate authority (CA) that issued the certificate.  This  has  the
              following format:

                 ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012

              issued. A browser might respond to certificate that has not been
              logged by showing an error message. The logs  are  cryptographi-
              cally secure.
