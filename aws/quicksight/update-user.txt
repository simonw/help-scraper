OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to update.

       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that the user is in. Cur-
          rently, you use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that con-
          tains your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace. Currently, you should set this to default .

       --email (string)
          The email address of the user that you want to update.

       --role (string)
          The  Amazon  QuickSight role of the user. The role can be one of the
          following default security cohorts:

          o READER : A user who has read-only access to dashboards.

          o AUTHOR : A user who can create data sources,  datasets,  analyses,
            and dashboards.

          o ADMIN : A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon Quick-
            Sight settings.

          The name of the Amazon QuickSight role is invisible to the user  ex-
          cept for the console screens dealing with permissions.

          Possible values:

          o ADMIN

          o AUTHOR

          o READER

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR

          o RESTRICTED_READER

       --custom-permissions-name (string)
          (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile
          that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions  allows
          you  to  control a user's access by restricting access the following
          operations:

          o Create and update data sources

          o Create and update datasets

          o Create and update email reports

          o Subscribe to email reports

          A set of custom permissions includes any combination  of  these  re-
          strictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for cus-
          tom permission sets by using the Amazon  QuickSight  console.  Then,
          you  use  the  RegisterUser API operation to assign the named set of
          permissions to a Amazon QuickSight user.

          Amazon QuickSight custom permissions are applied through  IAM  poli-
          cies.  Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted by
          assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security co-
          horts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

          This  feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edi-
          tion subscriptions.

       --unapply-custom-permissions |  --no-unapply-custom-permissions  (bool-
       ean)
          A  flag  that you use to indicate that you want to remove all custom
          permissions from this user. Using this parameter resets the user  to
          the state it was in before a custom permissions profile was applied.
          This parameter defaults to NULL and  it  doesn't  accept  any  other
          value.

       --external-login-federation-provider-type (string)
          The type of supported external login provider that provides identity
          to let a user federate into Amazon  QuickSight  with  an  associated
          Identity  and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported ex-
          ternal login provider can be one of the following.

          o COGNITO :  Amazon  Cognito.  The  provider  URL  is  cognito-iden-
            tity.amazonaws.com.  When choosing the COGNITO provider type, dont
            use the  "CustomFederationProviderUrl"  parameter  which  is  only
            needed when the external provider is custom.

          o CUSTOM_OIDC : Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing
            CUSTOM_OIDC type, use the CustomFederationProviderUrl parameter to
            provide the custom OIDC provider URL.

          o NONE  : This clears all the previously saved external login infor-
            mation for a user. Use the `` DescribeUser  ``  API  operation  to
            check the external login information.

       --custom-federation-provider-url (string)
          The  URL  of the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that provides
          identity to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an asso-
          ciated  Identity  and  Access  Management(IAM)  role. This parameter
          should only be used when ExternalLoginFederationProviderType parame-
          ter is set to CUSTOM_OIDC .

       --external-login-id (string)
          The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
