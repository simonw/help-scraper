OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID.

       --data-source-id (string)
          The ID of the data source. This ID is unique per Amazon Web Services
          Region for each Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

              underlying source. This is a variant type  structure.  For  this
              structure  to  be  valid,  only  one  of  the  attributes can be
              non-null.

                     access  for  the single Athena data source that is speci-
                     fied in the structure, even if the account-wide role for-

                     grant  Amazon QuickSight access to your cluster. This pa-
                     rameter can be used instead of DataSourceCredentials .

                        to  call  redshift:GetClusterCredentials on your clus-
                        ter. The calling principal must have iam:PassRole  ac-
                        cess to pass the role to Amazon QuickSight. The role's
                        trust policy must allow the Amazon QuickSight  service
                        principal to assume the role.

                     DatabaseUser -> (string)
                        The  user whose permissions and group memberships will
                        be used by Amazon QuickSight to access the cluster. If
                        this  user  already  exists  in  your database, Amazon
                        QuickSight is granted the same  permissions  that  the
                        user  has. If the user doesn't exist, set the value of
                        AutoCreateDatabaseUser to True to create  a  new  user
                        with PUBLIC permissions.

                     DatabaseGroups -> (list)
                        A  list of groups whose permissions will be granted to
                        Amazon QuickSight to access the cluster. These permis-
                        sions  are  combined  with  the permissions granted to
                        Amazon QuickSight by the DatabaseUser . If you  choose
                        to  include this parameter, the RoleArn must grant ac-
                        cess to redshift:JoinGroup .

                        (string)

                     AutoCreateDatabaseUser -> (boolean)
                        Automatically creates a database user. If  your  data-
                        base  doesn't have a DatabaseUser , set this parameter
                        to True . If there is no DatabaseUser , Amazon  Quick-
                        Sight  can't connect to your cluster. The RoleArn that
                        you use for this operation must grant access  to  red-
                        shift:CreateClusterUser  to  successfully  create  the
                        user.

                 IdentityCenterConfiguration -> (structure)
                     An optional parameter that configures IAM Identity Center
                     authentication  to grant Amazon QuickSight access to your
                     cluster.

                     This parameter can  only  be  specified  if  your  Amazon
                     QuickSight  account  is configured with IAM Identity Cen-
                     ter.

                     EnableIdentityPropagation -> (boolean)
                        A Boolean option that controls whether  Trusted  Iden-
                        tity Propagation should be used.

                 RoleArn -> (string)
                     Use the RoleArn structure  to  override  an  account-wide
                     role  for  a specific S3 data source. For example, say an
                     account administrator has turned off all S3  access  with
                     an  account-wide  role.  The  administrator  can then use
                     RoleArn to bypass the account-wide role and allow S3  ac-
                     cess  for  the single S3 data source that is specified in
                     the structure, even if the account-wide  role  forbidding
                     S3 access is still active.

              A set of alternate data source parameters that you want to share
              for the credentials stored with this data  source.  The  creden-
              tials are applied in tandem with the data source parameters when
              you copy a data source by using a create or update request.  The
              API operation compares the DataSourceParameters structure that's
              in the request with the structures in the AlternateDataSourcePa-
              rameters  allow  list. If the structures are an exact match, the
              request is allowed to use the  credentials  from  this  existing
              data  source. If the AlternateDataSourceParameters list is null,
              the Credentials originally used with  this  DataSourceParameters
              are automatically allowed.

                        role  for  a specific Athena data source. For example,
                        say an account administrator has turned off all Athena
                        access  with  an  account-wide role. The administrator
                        can then use RoleArn to bypass the  account-wide  role
                        and  allow  Athena  access  for the single Athena data
                        source that is specified in the structure, even if the
                        account-wide  role  forbidding  Athena access is still
                        active.

                        grant Amazon QuickSight access to your  cluster.  This
                        parameter can be used instead of DataSourceCredentials
                        .

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            Use the RoleArn structure to allow  Amazon  Quick-
                            Sight  to  call  redshift:GetClusterCredentials on
                            your cluster.  The  calling  principal  must  have
                            iam:PassRole  access  to  pass  the role to Amazon
                            QuickSight. The role's trust policy must allow the
                            Amazon  QuickSight service principal to assume the
                            role.

                            base,  Amazon  QuickSight is granted the same per-
                            missions that the user has. If  the  user  doesn't
                            exist,  set the value of AutoCreateDatabaseUser to
                            True to create a new user with PUBLIC permissions.

                        DatabaseGroups -> (list)
                            A list of groups whose permissions will be granted
                            to  Amazon QuickSight to access the cluster. These
                            permissions  are  combined  with  the  permissions
                            granted to Amazon QuickSight by the DatabaseUser .
                            If you  choose  to  include  this  parameter,  the
                            RoleArn must grant access to redshift:JoinGroup .

                            (string)

                        AutoCreateDatabaseUser -> (boolean)
                            Automatically  creates  a  database  user. If your
                            database doesn't have a DatabaseUser  ,  set  this
                            parameter  to True . If there is no DatabaseUser ,
                            Amazon QuickSight can't connect to  your  cluster.
                            The  RoleArn  that you use for this operation must
                            grant access to redshift:CreateClusterUser to suc-
                            cessfully create the user.

                     IdentityCenterConfiguration -> (structure)
                        An  optional  parameter  that  configures IAM Identity
                        Center authentication to grant Amazon  QuickSight  ac-
                        cess to your cluster.

                        This  parameter  can  only be specified if your Amazon
                        QuickSight account is  configured  with  IAM  Identity
                        Center.

                        EnableIdentityPropagation -> (boolean)
                            A  Boolean  option  that  controls whether Trusted
                            Identity Propagation should be used.

                        if  the  manifest file was uploaded into Amazon Quick-
                        Sight.

                        Bucket -> (string)

                     RoleArn -> (string)
                        Use the RoleArn structure to override an  account-wide
                        role  for  a specific S3 data source. For example, say
                        an account administrator has turned off all S3  access
                        with  an account-wide role. The administrator can then
                        use RoleArn to bypass the account-wide role and  allow
                        S3 access for the single S3 data source that is speci-
                        fied in the structure, even if the  account-wide  role
                        forbidding S3 access is still active.
