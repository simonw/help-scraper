NAME
       generate-embed-url-for-anonymous-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Generates  an  embed URL that you can use to embed an Amazon QuickSight
       dashboard in your website, without having to register any reader users.
       Before  you  use  this  action,  make sure that you have configured the
       dashboards and permissions.

       The following rules apply to the generated URL:

       o It contains a temporary bearer token. It is valid for 5 minutes after
         it  is  generated.  Once  redeemed  within  this period, it cannot be
         re-used again.

       o The URL validity period should not be confused with the  actual  ses-
         sion    lifetime    that    can    be   customized   using   the   ``
         SessionLifetimeInMinutes `` parameter. The resulting user session  is
         valid  for  15  minutes  (minimum) to 10 hours (maximum). The default
         session duration is 10 hours.

       o You are charged only when the URL is used  or  there  is  interaction
         with Amazon QuickSight.

       For  more  information, see Embedded Analytics in the Amazon QuickSight
       User Guide .

       For more information about the high-level steps for embedding  and  for
       an  interactive demo of the ways you can customize embedding, visit the
       Amazon QuickSight Developer Portal .

SYNOPSIS
            generate-embed-url-for-anonymous-user
          --aws-account-id <value>
          [--session-lifetime-in-minutes <value>]
          --namespace <value>
          [--session-tags <value>]
          --authorized-resource-arns <value>
          --experience-configuration <value>
          [--allowed-domains <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that contains  the  dash-
          board that you're embedding.

       --session-lifetime-in-minutes (long)
          How  many minutes the session is valid. The session lifetime must be
          in [15-600] minutes range.

       --namespace (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight namespace that the  anonymous  user  virtually
          belongs  to.  If you are not using an Amazon QuickSight custom name-
          space, set this to default .

       --session-tags (list)
          The session tags used for row-level security. Before  you  use  this
          parameter,  make sure that you have configured the relevant datasets
          using the  DataSet$RowLevelPermissionTagConfiguration  parameter  so
          that session tags can be used to provide row-level security.

          These  are  not  the  tags used for the Amazon Web Services resource
          tagging feature. For more information, see Using Row-Level  Security
          (RLS) with Tags in the Amazon QuickSight User Guide .

          (structure)
              The key-value pair used for the row-level security tags feature.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag.

              Value -> (string)
                 The value that you want to assign the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --authorized-resource-arns (list)
          The Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) for the Amazon QuickSight resources
          that the user is authorized to access during  the  lifetime  of  the
          session. If you choose Dashboard embedding experience, pass the list
          of dashboard ARNs in the account that you want the user to  be  able
          to view. Currently, you can pass up to 25 dashboard ARNs in each API
          call.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --experience-configuration (structure)
          The configuration of the experience that you are embedding.

          Dashboard -> (structure)
              The type of embedding experience. In this  case,  Amazon  Quick-
              Sight dashboards.

              InitialDashboardId -> (string)
                 The  dashboard ID for the dashboard that you want the user to
                 see first. This ID is included in the output  URL.  When  the
                 URL  in  response is accessed, Amazon QuickSight renders this
                 dashboard.

                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of this dashboard must be  in-
                 cluded  in  the  AuthorizedResourceArns parameter. Otherwise,
                 the request will fail with InvalidParameterValueException .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Dashboard={InitialDashboardId=string}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Dashboard": {
              "InitialDashboardId": "string"
            }
          }

       --allowed-domains (list)
          The domains that you want to add to the allow list for access to the
          generated  URL  that is then embedded. This optional parameter over-
          rides the static domains that are configured in  the  Manage  Quick-
          Sight menu in the Amazon QuickSight console. Instead, it allows only
          the domains that you include in this parameter. You can list  up  to
          three domains or subdomains in each API call.

          To include all subdomains under a specific domain to the allow list,
          use * . For example, https://*.sapp.amazon.com includes  all  subdo-
          mains under https://sapp.amazon.com .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       EmbedUrl -> (string)
          The embed URL for the dashboard.

       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.

       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.
