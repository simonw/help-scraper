OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The Amazon Web Services account ID.

       --data-set-id (string)
          The ID for the dataset that you want to create. This  ID  is  unique
          per Amazon Web Services Region for each Amazon Web Services account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

                 A  logical table is a unit that joins and that data transfor-
                 mations operate on. A logical table has a source,  which  can
                 be  either a physical table or result of a join. When a logi-
                 cal table points to a physical table, the logical table  acts
                 as  a  mutable  copy of that physical table through transform
                 operations.

                 Alias -> (string)

                        A data transformation on a logical table.  This  is  a
                        variant  type  structure.  For  this  structure  to be
                        valid, only one of the attributes can be non-null.

                        ProjectOperation -> (structure)

                            that  come  after  a  projection can only refer to
                            projected columns.

                            ProjectedColumns -> (list)

                               value. Rows for which the expression  evaluates
                               to true are kept in the dataset.

                        CreateColumnsOperation -> (structure)
                            An operation that creates calculated columns. Col-
                            umns created in one such operation form a  lexical
                            closure.

                            Columns -> (list)

                                      A  unique  ID  to  identify a calculated
                                      column. During a dataset update, if  the
                                      column ID of a calculated column matches
                                      that of an existing  calculated  column,
                                      Amazon QuickSight preserves the existing
                                      calculated column.

                        CastColumnTypeOperation -> (structure)
                            A  transform  operation  that  casts a column to a
                            different type.

                            ColumnName -> (string)

                               are only available for decimal columns that are
                               part of a SPICE dataset.

                            Format -> (string)
                               When casting a column from string  to  datetime
                               type,  you can supply a string in a format sup-
                               ported  by  Amazon  QuickSight  to  denote  the
                               source data format.

                               NOTE:
                                   This  is  not  tags for the Amazon Web Ser-
                                   vices tagging feature.
