OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account the import job was exe-
          cuted in.

       --asset-bundle-import-job-id (string)
          The ID of the job. The job ID is set when you start a new job with a
          StartAssetBundleImportJob API call.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS

       --endpoint-url (string)

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

                            bypass  the account-wide role and allow Athena ac-
                            cess for the single Athena  data  source  that  is

                            count-wide role forbidding Athena access is  still

                            Cluster ID. This field can be blank  if  the  Host
                            and Port are provided.

                        IAMParameters -> (structure)
                            An optional parameter that uses IAM authentication
                            to grant Amazon QuickSight access to your cluster.
                            This    parameter   can   be   used   instead   of
                            DataSourceCredentials .

                            RoleArn -> (string)
                               Use  the  RoleArn  structure  to  allow  Amazon
                               QuickSight  to  call redshift:GetClusterCreden-
                               tials on your cluster.  The  calling  principal
                               must  have iam:PassRole access to pass the role
                               to Amazon QuickSight. The role's  trust  policy
                               must  allow the Amazon QuickSight service prin-
                               cipal to assume the role.

                            DatabaseUser -> (string)
                               The user whose permissions  and  group  member-
                               ships  will be used by Amazon QuickSight to ac-
                               cess the cluster. If this user  already  exists
                               in  your database, Amazon QuickSight is granted
                               the same permissions that the user has. If  the
                               user  doesn't  exist, set the value of AutoCre-
                               ateDatabaseUser to True to create  a  new  user
                               with PUBLIC permissions.

                            DatabaseGroups -> (list)

                               granted to  Amazon  QuickSight  to  access  the
                               cluster.  These  permissions  are combined with
                               the permissions granted to Amazon QuickSight by
                               the  DatabaseUser  .  If  you choose to include
                               this parameter, the RoleArn must  grant  access
                               to redshift:JoinGroup .

                               (string)

                            AutoCreateDatabaseUser -> (boolean)
                               Automatically  creates a database user. If your
                               database doesn't have a DatabaseUser , set this
                               parameter to True . If there is no DatabaseUser
                               , Amazon QuickSight can't connect to your clus-
                               ter.  The  RoleArn that you use for this opera-
                               tion must grant access to  redshift:CreateClus-
                               terUser to successfully create the user.

                        IdentityCenterConfiguration -> (structure)

                            Center authentication to grant  Amazon  QuickSight
                            access to your cluster.

                            This  parameter can only be specified if your Ama-
                            zon QuickSight  account  is  configured  with  IAM
                            Identity Center.

                            EnableIdentityPropagation -> (boolean)

                               Identity Propagation should be used.

                            NULL if the manifest file was uploaded into Amazon
                            QuickSight.

                        RoleArn -> (string)
                            Use the  RoleArn  structure  to  override  an  ac-
                            count-wide role for a specific S3 data source. For
                            example, say an account administrator  has  turned
                            off  all  S3 access with an account-wide role. The
                            administrator can then use RoleArn to  bypass  the
                            account-wide role and allow S3 access for the sin-
                            gle S3 data source that is specified in the struc-
                            ture,  even if the account-wide role forbidding S3
                            access is still active.
