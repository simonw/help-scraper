       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-

       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument

       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
