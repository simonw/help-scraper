SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()                                        SEARCH-DASHBOARDS()



NAME
       search-dashboards -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for dashboards that belong to a user.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-dashboards is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: DashboardSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            search-dashboards
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the  Amazon Web Services account that contains the user
          whose dashboards you're searching for.

       --filters (list)
          The filters to apply to the search. Currently, you can  search  only
          by user name, for example, "Filters": [ { "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
          "Operator":      "StringEquals",      "Value":       "arn:aws:quick-
          sight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" } ]

          (structure)
              A filter that you apply when searching for dashboards.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example, "Operator": "StringEquals" .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example, "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER" .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the named item, in this case QUICKSIGHT_USER ,
                 that you want to use  as  a  filter,  for  example,  "Value":
                 "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/UserName1" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals",
              "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
