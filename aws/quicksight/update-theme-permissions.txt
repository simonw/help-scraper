NAME
       update-theme-permissions -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the resource permissions for a theme. Permissions apply to the
       action to grant or revoke permissions on, for  example  "quicksight:De-
       scribeTheme" .

       Theme  permissions apply in groupings. Valid groupings include the fol-
       lowing for the three levels of permissions, which are user,  owner,  or
       no permissions:

       o User

         o "quicksight:DescribeTheme"

         o "quicksight:DescribeThemeAlias"

         o "quicksight:ListThemeAliases"

         o "quicksight:ListThemeVersions"

       o Owner

         o "quicksight:DescribeTheme"

         o "quicksight:DescribeThemeAlias"

         o "quicksight:ListThemeAliases"

         o "quicksight:ListThemeVersions"

         o "quicksight:DeleteTheme"

         o "quicksight:UpdateTheme"

         o "quicksight:CreateThemeAlias"

         o "quicksight:DeleteThemeAlias"

         o "quicksight:UpdateThemeAlias"

         o "quicksight:UpdateThemePermissions"

         o "quicksight:DescribeThemePermissions"

       o To specify no permissions, omit the permissions list.

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that contains the theme.

              Principal -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal. This can be
                 one of the following:

                 o The ARN of an Amazon QuickSight user  or  group  associated
                   with a data source or dataset. (This is common.)

                 o The  ARN  of an Amazon QuickSight user, group, or namespace

                 o The  ARN of an Amazon Web Services account root: This is an
                   IAM ARN rather than a QuickSight ARN. Use this option  only
                   to  share  resources (templates) across Amazon Web Services
                   accounts. (This is less common.)

                 The IAM action to grant or revoke permissions on.

                 (string)

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Principal": "string",

          A list of resource permissions to be revoked from the theme.

          (structure)
              Permission for the resource.

              Principal -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the principal. This can  be
                 one of the following:

                 o The  ARN  of  an Amazon QuickSight user or group associated
                   with a data source or dataset. (This is common.)

                 o The ARN of an Amazon QuickSight user, group,  or  namespace
                   associated with an analysis, dashboard, template, or theme.
                   (This is common.)

                 o The ARN of an Amazon Web Services account root: This is  an
                   IAM  ARN rather than a QuickSight ARN. Use this option only
                   to share resources (templates) across Amazon  Web  Services
                   accounts. (This is less common.)

              Actions -> (list)
                 The IAM action to grant or revoke permissions on.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Principal=string,Actions=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Principal": "string",
              "Actions": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              Principal -> (string)
