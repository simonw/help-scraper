OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The  ID  of  the Amazon Web Services account that contains the theme
          that you're describing.

       --theme-id (string)
          The ID for the theme.

       --version-number (long)
          The version number for the version to describe. If  a  VersionNumber
          parameter  value  isn't provided, the latest version of the theme is
          described.

       --alias-name (string)
          The alias of the theme that you want to describe. If you name a spe-
          cific  alias, you describe the version that the alias points to. You
          can specify the latest version of the theme by providing the keyword
          $LATEST  in  the AliasName parameter. The keyword $PUBLISHED doesn't
          apply to themes.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
