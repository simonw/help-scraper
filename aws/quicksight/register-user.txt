OPTIONS
       --identity-type (string)
          Amazon  QuickSight supports several ways of managing the identity of
          users. This parameter accepts two values:

          o IAM : A user whose identity maps to an existing IAM user or role.

          o QUICKSIGHT : A user whose identity is owned and managed internally
            by Amazon QuickSight.

          Possible values:

          o IAM

          o QUICKSIGHT

       --email (string)
          The email address of the user that you want to register.

       --user-role (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight role for the user. The user role can be one of
          the following:

          o READER : A user who has read-only access to dashboards.

          o AUTHOR : A user who can create data sources,  datasets,  analyses,
            and dashboards.

          o ADMIN : A user who is an author, who can also manage Amazon Quick-
            Sight settings.

          o RESTRICTED_READER : This role isn't currently available for use.

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR : This role isn't currently available for use.

          Possible values:

          o ADMIN

          o AUTHOR

          o READER

          o RESTRICTED_AUTHOR

          o RESTRICTED_READER

       --iam-arn (string)
          The ARN of the IAM user or role that you are registering with Amazon
          QuickSight.

       --session-name (string)
          You  need  to  use this parameter only when you register one or more
          users using an assumed IAM role. You don't need to provide the  ses-
          sion  name for other scenarios, for example when you are registering
          an IAM user or an Amazon QuickSight user. You can register  multiple
          users  using  the same IAM role if each user has a different session
          name. For more information on assuming IAM roles, see `  assume-role
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/assume-role.html`__
          in the CLI Reference.

       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID for the Amazon Web Services account that the user is in. Cur-
          rently, you use the ID for the Amazon Web Services account that con-
          tains your Amazon QuickSight account.

       --namespace (string)
          The namespace. Currently, you should set this to default .

       --user-name (string)
          The Amazon QuickSight user name that you want to create for the user
          you are registering.

       --custom-permissions-name (string)
          (Enterprise edition only) The name of the custom permissions profile
          that you want to assign to this user. Customized permissions  allows
          you  to  control a user's access by restricting access the following
          operations:

          o Create and update data sources

          o Create and update datasets

          o Create and update email reports

          o Subscribe to email reports

          To add custom permissions to an existing user, use `` UpdateUser  ``
          instead.

          A  set  of  custom permissions includes any combination of these re-
          strictions. Currently, you need to create the profile names for cus-
          tom  permission  sets  by using the Amazon QuickSight console. Then,
          you use the RegisterUser API operation to assign the  named  set  of
          permissions to a QuickSight user.

          Amazon  QuickSight  custom permissions are applied through IAM poli-
          cies. Therefore, they override the permissions typically granted  by
          assigning Amazon QuickSight users to one of the default security co-
          horts in Amazon QuickSight (admin, author, reader).

          This feature is available only to Amazon QuickSight Enterprise  edi-
          tion subscriptions.

       --external-login-federation-provider-type (string)
          The type of supported external login provider that provides identity
          to let a user federate into Amazon  QuickSight  with  an  associated
          Identity  and Access Management(IAM) role. The type of supported ex-
          ternal login provider can be one of the following.

          o COGNITO :  Amazon  Cognito.  The  provider  URL  is  cognito-iden-
            tity.amazonaws.com.  When choosing the COGNITO provider type, dont
            use the  "CustomFederationProviderUrl"  parameter  which  is  only
            needed when the external provider is custom.

          o CUSTOM_OIDC : Custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider. When choosing
            CUSTOM_OIDC type, use the CustomFederationProviderUrl parameter to
            provide the custom OIDC provider URL.

       --custom-federation-provider-url (string)
          The  URL  of the custom OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that provides
          identity to let a user federate into Amazon QuickSight with an asso-
          ciated  Identity  and  Access  Management(IAM)  role. This parameter
          should only be used when ExternalLoginFederationProviderType parame-
          ter is set to CUSTOM_OIDC .

       --external-login-id (string)
          The identity ID for a user in the external login provider.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
