SEARCH-ANALYSES()                                            SEARCH-ANALYSES()



NAME
       search-analyses -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for analyses that belong to the user specified in the filter.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-analyses is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: AnalysisSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            search-analyses
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that contains the analyses
          that you're searching for.

       --filters (list)
          The structure for the search filters that you want to apply to  your
          search.

          (structure)
              A filter that you apply when searching for one or more analyses.

              Operator -> (string)
                 The comparison operator that you want to use as a filter, for
                 example "Operator": "StringEquals" .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the value that you want to use as a  filter,  for
                 example "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER" .

              Value -> (string)
                 The  value  of the named item, in this case QUICKSIGHT_USER ,
                 that you want to use as a filter, for example  "Value"  .  An
                 example is "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:1:user/default/User-
                 Name1" .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Operator=string,Name=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Operator": "StringEquals",
              "Name": "QUICKSIGHT_USER",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnalysisSummaryList -> (list)
          Metadata describing the analyses that you searched for.

          (structure)

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the analysis. This name is displayed in the  Ama-
                 zon QuickSight console.

              Status -> (string)
                 The last known status for the analysis.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time that the analysis was last updated.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A pagination token that can be used in a subsequent request.

       Status -> (integer)
          The HTTP status of the request.

       RequestId -> (string)
          The Amazon Web Services request ID for this operation.
