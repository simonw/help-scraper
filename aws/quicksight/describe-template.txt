       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-template
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --template-id <value>
          [--version-number <value>]
          [--alias-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account that contains the template
          that you're describing.

       --template-id (string)
          The ID for the template.

       --version-number (long)
          (Optional) The number for the version to describe. If a  VersionNum-
          ber  parameter  value isn't provided, the latest version of the tem-
          plate is described.

       --alias-name (string)
          The alias of the template that you want to describe. If you  name  a
          specific  alias,  you describe the version that the alias points to.
          You can specify the latest version of the template by providing  the
          keyword  $LATEST  in the AliasName parameter. The keyword $PUBLISHED
          doesn't apply to templates.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
