       --logical-table-map (map)
          Configures the combination and transformation of the data  from  the
          physical tables.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (structure)
              A  logical  table is a unit that joins and that data transforma-
              tions operate on. A logical table has a source, which can be ei-
              ther  a physical table or result of a join. When a logical table
              points to a physical table, the logical table acts as a  mutable
              copy of that physical table through transform operations.

              Alias -> (string)
                 A display name for the logical table.

              DataTransforms -> (list)

                 (structure)
                     A data transformation on a logical table. This is a vari-
                     ant type structure. For this structure to be valid,  only
                     one of the attributes can be non-null.

                     ProjectOperation -> (structure)
                        An  operation  that  projects columns. Operations that
                        come after a projection can only  refer  to  projected
                        columns.

                        ProjectedColumns -> (list)
                            Projected columns.

                            value.  Rows for which the expression evaluates to
                            true are kept in the dataset.

                     CreateColumnsOperation -> (structure)
                        An operation that creates calculated columns.  Columns
                        created in one such operation form a lexical closure.

                        Columns -> (list)
                            Calculated columns to create.

                            (structure)
                               A calculated column for a dataset.

                                   umn. During a dataset update, if the column
                                   ID  of  a calculated column matches that of
                                   an  existing  calculated   column,   Amazon
                                   QuickSight  preserves  the  existing calcu-
                                   lated column.

                               Expression -> (string)
                                   An expression that defines  the  calculated
                                   column.

                            type,  you  can  supply  a string in a format sup-
                            ported by Amazon QuickSight to denote  the  source
                            data format.

                     TagColumnOperation -> (structure)

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the

       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
