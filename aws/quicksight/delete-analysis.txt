DELETE-ANALYSIS()                                            DELETE-ANALYSIS()



NAME
       delete-analysis -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an analysis from Amazon QuickSight. You can optionally include
       a recovery window during which you can restore  the  analysis.  If  you
       don't  specify  a  recovery  window value, the operation defaults to 30
       days. Amazon QuickSight attaches a DeletionTime stamp to  the  response
       that specifies the end of the recovery window. At the end of the recov-
       ery window, Amazon QuickSight deletes the analysis permanently.

       At any time before recovery window ends, you can use the  RestoreAnaly-
       sis API operation to remove the DeletionTime stamp and cancel the dele-
       tion of the analysis. The analysis remains visible  in  the  API  until
       it's deleted, so you can describe it but you can't make a template from
       it.

       An analysis that's scheduled for deletion isn't accessible in the  Ama-
       zon QuickSight console. To access it in the console, restore it. Delet-
       ing an analysis doesn't delete the dashboards that you publish from it.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-analysis
          --aws-account-id <value>
          --analysis-id <value>
          [--recovery-window-in-days <value>]
          [--force-delete-without-recovery | --no-force-delete-without-recovery]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --aws-account-id (string)
          The ID of the Amazon Web Services account where you want  to  delete
          an analysis.

       --analysis-id (string)
          The ID of the analysis that you're deleting.

       --recovery-window-in-days (long)
          A  value  that  specifies  the number of days that Amazon QuickSight
          waits before it deletes the analysis. You can't use  this  parameter
          with the ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery option in the same API call. The
          default value is 30.

       --force-delete-without-recovery  |   --no-force-delete-without-recovery
       (boolean)
          This  option defaults to the value NoForceDeleteWithoutRecovery . To
          immediately delete the analysis, add the  ForceDeleteWithoutRecovery
          option. You can't restore an analysis after it's deleted.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
