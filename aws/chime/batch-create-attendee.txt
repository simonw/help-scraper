SYNOPSIS
            batch-create-attendee

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --meeting-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime SDK meeting ID.

       --attendees (list)
          The request containing the attendees to create.

          (structure)
              The  Amazon  Chime  SDK attendee fields to create, used with the
              BatchCreateAttendee action.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency  token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              Tags -> (list)
                 The tag key-value pairs.

                 (structure)
                     Describes a tag applied to a resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The key of the tag.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the tag.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ExternalUserId=string,Tags=[{Key=string,Value=string},{Key=string,Value=string}] ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ExternalUserId": "string",
              "Tags": [
                {
                  "Key": "string",
                  "Value": "string"
                }
                ...
              ]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Attendees -> (list)
          The attendee information, including attendees IDs and join tokens.

          (structure)
              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-
              deeId and JoinToken . The JoinToken allows a client to authenti-
              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires
              when  the  meeting ends or when  DeleteAttendee is called. After
              that, the attendee is unable to join the meeting.

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the
              attendee.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              AttendeeId -> (string)
                 The Amazon Chime SDK attendee ID.

              JoinToken -> (string)
                 The join token used by the Amazon Chime SDK attendee.

       Errors -> (list)
          If the action fails for one or more of the attendees in the request,
          a list of the attendees is returned, along with error codes and  er-
          ror messages.

          (structure)
              The  list  of errors returned when errors are encountered during
              the BatchCreateAttendee and  CreateAttendee  actions.  This  in-
              cludes external user IDs, error codes, and error messages.

              ExternalUserId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon Chime SDK external user ID. An idempotency token.
                 Links the attendee to an identity managed by a builder appli-
                 cation.

              ErrorCode -> (string)
                 The error code.

              ErrorMessage -> (string)
                 The error message.
