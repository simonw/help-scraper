       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not

       the string will be taken literally.

       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              An Amazon Chime SDK meeting attendee. Includes a  unique  Atten-

              cate and join as the specified attendee. The  JoinToken  expires

              We recommend securely  transferring  each  JoinToken  from  your
              server application to the client so that no other client has ac-
              cess to the token except for the one authorized to represent the

                 cation.

          a list of the attendees is returned, along with error codes and  er-
          ror messages.
