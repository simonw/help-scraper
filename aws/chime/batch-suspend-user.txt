BATCH-SUSPEND-USER()                                      BATCH-SUSPEND-USER()



NAME
       batch-suspend-user -

DESCRIPTION
       Suspends  up  to 50 users from a Team or EnterpriseLWA Amazon Chime ac-
       count. For more information about different account types, see Managing
       Your Amazon Chime Accounts in the Amazon Chime Administration Guide .

       Users  suspended  from  a  Team  account are disassociated from the ac-
       count,but they can continue to use Amazon Chime as free users.  To  re-
       move  the  suspension from suspended Team account users, invite them to
       the Team account again. You can use the  InviteUsers action to do so.

       Users suspended from an EnterpriseLWA account  are  immediately  signed
       out of Amazon Chime and can no longer sign in. To remove the suspension
       from suspended EnterpriseLWA account users, use the  BatchUnsuspendUser
       action.

       To sign out users without suspending them, use the  LogoutUser action.

SYNOPSIS
            batch-suspend-user
          --account-id <value>
          --user-id-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The Amazon Chime account ID.

       --user-id-list (list)
          The request containing the user IDs to suspend.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To suspend multiple users

       The following batch-suspend-user example suspends the listed users from
       the specified Amazon Chime account.

          aws chime batch-suspend-user \
              --account-id a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE \
              --user-id-list "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-22222EXAMPLE" "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-33333EXAMPLE" "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-44444EXAMPLE"

       Output:

          {
              "UserErrors": []
          }

OUTPUT

          If  the   BatchSuspendUser  action fails for one or more of the user
