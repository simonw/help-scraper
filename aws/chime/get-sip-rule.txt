GET-SIP-RULE()                                                  GET-SIP-RULE()



NAME
       get-sip-rule -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  the  details of a SIP rule, such as the rule ID, name, trig-
       gers, and target endpoints.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-sip-rule
          --sip-rule-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --sip-rule-id (string)
          The SIP rule ID.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          The SIP rule details.

          SipRuleId -> (string)

          TriggerType -> (string)
              The  type  of trigger assigned to the SIP rule in TriggerValue ,
              currently RequestUriHostname or ToPhoneNumber .

                 SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                     The SIP media application ID.

                 Priority -> (integer)
                     Priority of the SIP media application in the target list.

                 AwsRegion -> (string)
                     The AWS Region of the target application.

          CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
              The time at which the SIP rule was created, in ISO 8601 format.

          UpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
