NAME
       list-sip-media-applications -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the SIP media applications under the administrator's AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-sip-media-applications
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number of results to return in a single call. Defaults
          to 100.

       --next-token (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SipMediaApplications -> (list)
          List of SIP media applications and application details.

          (structure)
              The  details  of  the  SIP media application, including name and
              endpoints. An AWS account can have multiple SIP  media  applica-
              tions.

              SipMediaApplicationId -> (string)
                 The SIP media application ID.

              AwsRegion -> (string)
                 The AWS Region in which the SIP media application is created.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the SIP media application.

              Endpoints -> (list)
                 List  of endpoints for SIP media application. Currently, only
                 one endpoint per SIP media application is permitted.

                 (structure)
                     The endpoint assigned to the SIP media application.

                     LambdaArn -> (string)
                        Valid Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  Lambda  func-
                        tion. The function must be created in the same AWS Re-
                        gion as the SIP media application.

              CreatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The SIP media application creation  timestamp,  in  ISO  8601
                 format.

              UpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 The SIP media application updated timestamp, in ISO 8601 for-
                 mat.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The token to use to retrieve the next page of results.
