DESCRIBE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()                  DESCRIBE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()



NAME
       describe-gateway-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  metadata about a gateway such as its name, network interfaces,
       configured time zone, and the state (whether the gateway is running  or
       not).  To  specify  which  gateway to describe, use the Amazon Resource
       Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-gateway-information
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To describe a gateway

       The following  describe-gateway-information  command  returns  metadata
       about the specified gateway.  To specify which gateway to describe, use
       the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the command.

       This examples specifies a gateway with the id sgw-12A3456B  in  account
       123456789012:

          aws storagegateway describe-gateway-information --gateway-arn "arn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:123456789012:gateway/sgw-12A3456B"

       This  command  outputs  a JSON block that contains metadata about about
       the gateway such as its name, network interfaces, configured time zone,
       and the state (whether the gateway is running or not).
