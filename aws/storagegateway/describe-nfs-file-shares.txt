NAME
       describe-nfs-file-shares -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  description  for  one  or  more Network File System (NFS) file
       shares from an S3 File Gateway. This operation is only supported for S3
       File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-nfs-file-shares
          --file-share-arn-list <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --file-share-arn-list (list)
          An  array  containing  the  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of each file
          share to be described.

          (string)
              The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NFSFileShareInfoList -> (list)
          An array containing a description for each requested file share.

          (structure)
              The Unix file permissions and ownership information assigned, by
              default,  to native S3 objects when an S3 File Gateway discovers
              them in S3 buckets. This operation is only supported in S3  File
              Gateways.

              NFSFileShareDefaults -> (structure)
                 Describes  Network  File System (NFS) file share default val-
                 ues. Files and folders stored as  Amazon  S3  objects  in  S3
                 buckets  don't,  by  default,  have Unix file permissions as-
                 signed to them. Upon discovery in an  S3  bucket  by  Storage
                 Gateway,  the S3 objects that represent files and folders are
                 assigned these default Unix permissions.  This  operation  is
                 only supported for S3 File Gateways.

                 FileMode -> (string)
                     The  Unix file mode in the form "nnnn". For example, 0666
                     represents the default file mode inside the  file  share.
                     The default value is 0666 .

                 DirectoryMode -> (string)
                     The  Unix directory mode in the form "nnnn". For example,
                     0666 represents the default access mode for all  directo-
                     ries inside the file share. The default value is 0777 .

                 GroupId -> (long)
                     The default group ID for the file share (unless the files
                     have another group ID specified). The  default  value  is
                     nfsnobody .

                 OwnerId -> (long)
                     The  default owner ID for files in the file share (unless
                     the files have another owner ID specified).  The  default
                     value is nfsnobody .

              FileShareARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the file share.

              FileShareId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file share.

              FileShareStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the file share.

                 Valid Values: CREATING | UPDATING | AVAILABLE | DELETING

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways operation to return a list of gateways for your  ac-
                 count and Amazon Web Services Region.

              KMSEncrypted -> (boolean)
                 Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your
                 own KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3.  Op-
                 tional.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption.  Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              Path -> (string)
                 The file share path used by the NFS client  to  identify  the
                 mount point.

              Role -> (string)
                 The  ARN of the IAM role that an S3 File Gateway assumes when
                 it accesses the underlying storage.

              LocationARN -> (string)
                 A custom ARN for the backend storage used  for  storing  data
                 for  file shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional
                 prefix concatenation. The prefix  must  end  with  a  forward
                 slash (/).

                 NOTE:
                     You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point
                     ARN or access point alias, as shown in the following  ex-
                     amples.

                     Bucket ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/

                     Access point ARN:
                        arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/ac-
                        cess-point-name/prefix/

                     If you specify an access point, the bucket policy must be
                     configured  to  delegate  access  control  to  the access
                     point. For information, see Delegating access control  to
                     access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .

                     Access point alias:
                        test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias

              DefaultStorageClass -> (string)
                 The  default  storage class for objects put into an Amazon S3
                 bucket by the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_INTEL-
                 LIGENT_TIERING . Optional.

                 Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING | S3_STAN-
                 DARD_IA | S3_ONEZONE_IA

              ObjectACL -> (string)
                 A value that sets the access control  list  (ACL)  permission
                 for objects in the S3 bucket that an S3 File Gateway puts ob-
                 jects into. The default value is private .

              ClientList -> (list)
                 The list of clients that are allowed to access  the  S3  File
                 Gateway.  The  list must contain either valid IP addresses or
                 valid CIDR blocks.

                 (string)

              Squash -> (string)
                 The user mapped to anonymous user. Valid options are the fol-
                 lowing:

                 o RootSquash : Only root is mapped to anonymous user.

                 o NoSquash : No one is mapped to anonymous user.

                 o AllSquash : Everyone is mapped to anonymous user.

              ReadOnly -> (boolean)
                 A  value that sets the write status of a file share. Set this
                 value to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise
                 set to false .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              GuessMIMETypeEnabled -> (boolean)
                 A  value  that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded
                 objects based on file extensions. Set this value to  true  to
                 enable  MIME  type guessing, otherwise set to false . The de-
                 fault value is true .

                 Valid Values: true | false

              RequesterPays -> (boolean)
                 A value that sets who pays the cost of the  request  and  the
                 cost  associated  with  data  download from the S3 bucket. If
                 this value is set to true , the  requester  pays  the  costs;
                 otherwise,  the  S3 bucket owner pays. However, the S3 bucket
                 owner always pays the cost of storing data.

                 NOTE:
                     RequesterPays is a configuration for the S3  bucket  that
                     backs the file share, so make sure that the configuration
                     on the file share is the same as the S3 bucket configura-
                     tion.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              Tags -> (list)
                 A  list  of  up  to  50  tags assigned to the NFS file share,
                 sorted alphabetically by key name. Each tag  is  a  key-value
                 pair.  For a gateway with more than 10 tags assigned, you can
                 view all tags using the ListTagsForResource API operation.

                 (structure)
                     A key-value pair  that  helps  you  manage,  filter,  and
                     search  for  your  resource. Allowed characters: letters,
                     white space, and numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the
                     following characters: + - = . _ : /.

                     Key -> (string)
                        Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

                     Value -> (string)
                        Value of the tag key.

              FileShareName -> (string)
                 The name of the file share. Optional.

                 NOTE:
                     FileShareName  must be set if an S3 prefix name is set in
                     LocationARN , or if an access point or access point alias
                     is used.

              CacheAttributes -> (structure)
                 Refresh cache information for the file share.

                 CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
                     Refreshes  a  file  share's  cache  by using Time To Live
                     (TTL). TTL is the length of time since the  last  refresh
                     after  which access to the directory would cause the file
                     gateway to first refresh that directory's  contents  from
                     the  Amazon  S3 bucket or Amazon FSx file system. The TTL
                     duration is in seconds.

                     Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30
                     days)

              NotificationPolicy -> (string)
                 The notification policy of the file share. SettlingTimeInSec-
                 onds controls the number of seconds to wait  after  the  last
                 point  in  time a client wrote to a file before generating an
                 ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients  can  make  many
                 small writes to files, it's best to set this parameter for as
                 long as possible to avoid generating  multiple  notifications
                 for the same file in a small time period.

                 NOTE:
                     SettlingTimeInSeconds  has no effect on the timing of the
                     object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the no-
                     tification.

                 The  following  example  sets NotificationPolicy on with Set-
                 tlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.
                     {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

                 The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
                     {}

              VPCEndpointDNSName -> (string)
                 Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the NFS file
                 share uses to connect to Amazon S3.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter is required for NFS file shares that con-
                     nect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint,  a  VPC  access
                     point,  or an access point alias that points to a VPC ac-
                     cess point.

              BucketRegion -> (string)
                 Specifies the Region of the S3  bucket  where  the  NFS  file
                 share stores files.

                 NOTE:
                     This  parameter is required for NFS file shares that con-
                     nect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint,  a  VPC  access
                     point,  or an access point alias that points to a VPC ac-
                     cess point.

              AuditDestinationARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage used for  audit
                 logs.
