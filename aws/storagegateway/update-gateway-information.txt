UPDATE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()                      UPDATE-GATEWAY-INFORMATION()



NAME
       update-gateway-information -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  gateway's  metadata,  which includes the gateway's name and
       time zone. To specify which gateway to update, use the Amazon  Resource
       Name (ARN) of the gateway in your request.

       NOTE:
          For  gateways  activated  after September 2, 2015, the gateway's ARN
          contains the gateway ID  rather  than  the  gateway  name.  However,
          changing the name of the gateway has no effect on the gateway's ARN.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            update-gateway-information
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--gateway-name <value>]
          [--gateway-timezone <value>]
          [--cloud-watch-log-group-arn <value>]
          [--gateway-capacity <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --gateway-name (string)
          The name you configured for your gateway.

       --gateway-timezone (string)
          A value that indicates the time zone of the gateway.

       --cloud-watch-log-group-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of the Amazon CloudWatch log group
          that you want to use to monitor and log events in the gateway.

          For more information, see What is Amazon CloudWatch Logs?

       --gateway-capacity (string)
          Specifies the size of the gateway's metadata cache.

          Possible values:

          o Small

          o Medium

          o Large

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)

          Web Services Region.
