UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-START-TIME()                UPDATE-MAINTENANCE-START-TIME()



NAME
       update-maintenance-start-time -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a  gateway's  maintenance  window  schedule, with settings for
       monthly or weekly cadence, specific day and time to begin  maintenance,
       and  which types of updates to apply. Time configuration uses the gate-
       way's time zone. You can pass values for a complete maintenance  sched-
       ule, or update policy, or both. Previous values will persist for which-
       ever setting you choose not to modify.  If  an  incomplete  or  invalid
       maintenance  schedule  is  passed,  the entire request will be rejected
       with an error and no changes will occur.

       A complete maintenance schedule must include values for  both   Minute-
       OfHour and HourOfDay , and either  DayOfMonth  or  DayOfWeek .

       NOTE:
          We  recommend  keeping maintenance updates turned on, except in spe-
          cific use cases where the brief disruptions caused by  updating  the
          gateway could critically impact your deployment.

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --hour-of-day (integer)
          The hour component of the maintenance start time represented as hh ,
          where hh is the hour (00 to 23). The hour of the day is in the  time
          zone of the gateway.

       --minute-of-hour (integer)
          The minute component of the maintenance start time represented as mm
          , where mm is the minute (00 to 59). The minute of the  hour  is  in
          the time zone of the gateway.

       --day-of-week (integer)
          The  day  of  the  week component of the maintenance start time week
          represented as an ordinal number from 0 to  6,  where  0  represents
          Sunday and 6 represents Saturday.

       --day-of-month (integer)
          The  day of the month component of the maintenance start time repre-
          sented as an ordinal number from 1 to 28,  where  1  represents  the
          first  day  of  the month. It is not possible to set the maintenance
          schedule to start on days 29 through 31.

       --software-update-preferences (structure)
          A set of variables indicating the software  update  preferences  for
          the gateway.

          Includes AutomaticUpdatePolicy field with the following inputs:
              ALL_VERSIONS - Enables regular gateway maintenance updates.

              EMERGENCY_VERSIONS_ONLY  -  Disables regular gateway maintenance
              updates. The gateway will still receive  emergency  version  up-
              dates  on  rare occasions if necessary to remedy highly critical
              security or durability issues. You will be  notified  before  an
              emergency  version  update is applied. These updates are applied
              during your gateway's scheduled maintenance window.

          AutomaticUpdatePolicy -> (string)
              Indicates the automatic update policy for a gateway.
                 ALL_VERSIONS - Enables regular gateway maintenance updates.

                 EMERGENCY_VERSIONS_ONLY - Disables  regular  gateway  mainte-
                 nance  updates. The gateway will still receive emergency ver-
                 sion updates on rare occasions if necessary to remedy  highly
                 critical  security or durability issues. You will be notified
                 before an emergency version update is applied. These  updates
                 are  applied during your gateway's scheduled maintenance win-
                 dow.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          AutomaticUpdatePolicy=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "AutomaticUpdatePolicy": "ALL_VERSIONS"|"EMERGENCY_VERSIONS_ONLY"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable  automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled, the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
