NAME
       describe-upload-buffer -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about the upload buffer of a gateway. This opera-
       tion is supported for the stored volume, cached volume, and tape  gate-
       way types.

       The  response  includes  disk  IDs that are configured as upload buffer
       space, and it includes the amount of upload buffer space allocated  and
       used.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-upload-buffer
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An array of the gateway's local disk  IDs  that  are  configured  as
          working  storage. Each local disk ID is specified as a string (mini-
          mum length of 1 and maximum length of 300). If no  local  disks  are
          configured as working storage, then the DiskIds array is empty.

          (string)

       UploadBufferUsedInBytes -> (long)
          The total number of bytes being used in the gateway's upload buffer.

       UploadBufferAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The  total number of bytes allocated in the gateway's as upload buf-
          fer.
