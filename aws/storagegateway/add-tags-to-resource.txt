ADD-TAGS-TO-RESOURCE()                                  ADD-TAGS-TO-RESOURCE()



NAME
       add-tags-to-resource -

DESCRIPTION
       Adds  one  or  more tags to the specified resource. You use tags to add
       metadata to resources, which you can use to categorize these resources.
       For  example,  you can categorize resources by purpose, owner, environ-
       ment, or team. Each tag consists of a key and a value,  which  you  de-
       fine. You can add tags to the following Storage Gateway resources:

       o Storage gateways of all types

       o Storage volumes

       o Virtual tapes

       o NFS and SMB file shares

       o File System associations

       You  can  create  a maximum of 50 tags for each resource. Virtual tapes
       and storage volumes that are recovered to a new gateway maintain  their
       tags.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            add-tags-to-resource
          --resource-arn <value>
          --tags <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource you want to add tags
          to.

       --tags (list)
          The key-value pair that represents the tag you want to  add  to  the
          resource. The value can be an empty string.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers representable in UTF-8 format, and  the  following  special
              characters:  +  - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a tag's key
              is 128 characters, and the maximum length for a tag's  value  is
              256.

          (structure)
              A  key-value  pair that helps you manage, filter, and search for
              your resource. Allowed characters:  letters,  white  space,  and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ResourceARN -> (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource you want to add tags
          to.
