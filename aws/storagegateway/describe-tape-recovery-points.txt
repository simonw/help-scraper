DESCRIBE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINTS()                DESCRIBE-TAPE-RECOVERY-POINTS()



NAME
       describe-tape-recovery-points -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of virtual tape recovery points that are available for
       the specified tape gateway.

       A recovery point is a point-in-time view of a virtual tape at which all
       the  data  on  the virtual tape is consistent. If your gateway crashes,
       virtual tapes that have recovery points can be recovered to a new gate-
       way. This operation is only supported in the tape gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-tape-recovery-points  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: TapeRecoveryPointInfos

SYNOPSIS
            describe-tape-recovery-points
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       TapeRecoveryPointInfos -> (list)
          An array of TapeRecoveryPointInfos that are available for the speci-
          fied gateway.

          (structure)
              Describes a recovery point.

              TapeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the virtual tape.

              TapeRecoveryPointTime -> (timestamp)
                 The  time when the point-in-time view of the virtual tape was
                 replicated for later recovery.

                 The default timestamp format of the tape recovery point  time
                 is in the ISO8601 extended YYYY-MM-DD'T'HH:MM:SS'Z' format.

              TapeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size, in bytes, of the virtual tapes to recover.

              TapeStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the virtual tapes.

       Marker -> (string)
          An  opaque  string  that indicates the position at which the virtual
          tape recovery points that were listed for description ended.

          Use this marker in your next request to list the next set of virtual
          tape  recovery  points  in  the  list. If there are no more recovery
          points to describe, this field does not appear in the response.
