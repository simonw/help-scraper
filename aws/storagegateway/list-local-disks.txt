LIST-LOCAL-DISKS()                                          LIST-LOCAL-DISKS()



NAME
       list-local-disks -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a  list of the gateway's local disks. To specify which gateway
       to describe, you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  gateway  in
       the body of the request.

       The  request  returns a list of all disks, specifying which are config-
       ured as working storage, cache storage, or stored volume or not config-
       ured  at  all. The response includes a DiskStatus field. This field can
       have a value of present (the disk is available to  use),  missing  (the
       disk is no longer connected to the gateway), or mismatch (the disk node
       is occupied by a disk that has incorrect metadata or the  disk  content
       is corrupted).

SYNOPSIS
            list-local-disks
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       Disks -> (list)
          A JSON object containing the following fields:

          o ListLocalDisksOutput$Disks

          (structure)
              Represents a gateway's local disk.

              DiskId -> (string)
                 The unique device ID or other distinguishing data that  iden-
                 tifies a local disk.

              DiskPath -> (string)
                 The path of a local disk in the gateway virtual machine (VM).

              DiskNode -> (string)
                 The  device  node of a local disk as assigned by the virtual-
                 ization environment.

              DiskStatus -> (string)
                 A value that represents the status of a local disk.

              DiskSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The local disk size in bytes.

              DiskAllocationType -> (string)
                 One of the DiskAllocationType enumeration values that identi-
                 fies how a local disk is used.

                 Valid Values: UPLOAD_BUFFER | CACHE_STORAGE

              DiskAllocationResource -> (string)
                 The  iSCSI  qualified  name (IQN) that is defined for a disk.
                 This field is not included in the response if the local  disk
                 is  not  defined as an iSCSI target. The format of this field
                 is targetIqn::LUNNumber::region-volumeId .

              DiskAttributeList -> (list)
                 A list of values that represents attributes of a local disk.

                 (string)
