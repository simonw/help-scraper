CREATE-TAPES()                                                  CREATE-TAPES()



NAME
       create-tapes -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  one or more virtual tapes. You write data to the virtual tapes
       and then archive the tapes. This operation is  only  supported  in  the
       tape gateway type.

       NOTE:
          Cache storage must be allocated to the gateway before you can create
          virtual tapes. Use the  AddCache operation to add cache storage to a
          gateway.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --gateway-arn <value>
          --tape-size-in-bytes <value>
          --client-token <value>
          --num-tapes-to-create <value>
          --tape-barcode-prefix <value>
          [--kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted]
          [--kms-key <value>]
          [--pool-id <value>]
          [--worm | --no-worm]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that represents the gateway to
          associate the virtual tapes with. Use the  ListGateways operation to
          return  a  list of gateways for your account and Amazon Web Services
          Region.

       --tape-size-in-bytes (long)
          The size, in bytes, of the virtual tapes that you want to create.

          NOTE:
              The size must be aligned by gigabyte (1024*1024*1024 bytes).

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier that you use to retry a request. If you retry  a
          request,  use  the same ClientToken you specified in the initial re-
          quest.

          NOTE:
              Using the same ClientToken prevents creating the  tape  multiple
              times.

       --num-tapes-to-create (integer)
          The number of virtual tapes that you want to create.

       --tape-barcode-prefix (string)
          A  prefix that you append to the barcode of the virtual tape you are
          creating. This prefix makes the barcode unique.

          NOTE:
              The prefix must be 1-4 characters in length and must be  one  of
              the uppercase letters from A to Z.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --pool-id (string)
          The  ID of the pool that you want to add your tape to for archiving.
          The tape in this pool is archived in the S3 storage  class  that  is
          associated  with  the  pool. When you use your backup application to
          eject the tape, the tape is archived directly into the storage class
          (S3  Glacier  or  S3  Glacier  Deep Archive) that corresponds to the
          pool.

          Valid Values: GLACIER | DEEP_ARCHIVE

       --worm | --no-worm (boolean)
          Set to TRUE if the tape you are creating is to be  configured  as  a
          write-once-read-many (WORM) tape.

       --tags (list)
          A list of up to 50 tags that can be assigned to a virtual tape. Each
          tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers  representable  in  UTF-8 format, and the following special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a  tag's  key
              is  128  characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is
              256.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and  search  for
              your  resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters, white space, and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TapeARNs -> (list)
          A list of unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)  that  represents  the
          virtual tapes that were created.

          (string)



                                                                CREATE-TAPES()
