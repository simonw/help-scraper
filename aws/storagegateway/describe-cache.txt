DESCRIBE-CACHE()                                              DESCRIBE-CACHE()



NAME
       describe-cache -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  the  cache of a gateway. This operation is
       only supported in the cached volume, tape, and file gateway types.

       The response includes disk IDs that are configured as cache, and it in-
       cludes the amount of cache allocated and used.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-cache
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       DiskIds -> (list)
          An array of strings that identify disks that are to be configured as
          working  storage.  Each string has a minimum length of 1 and maximum
          length of 300. You can get the disk  IDs  from  the   ListLocalDisks
          API.

          (string)

       CacheAllocatedInBytes -> (long)
          The amount of cache in bytes allocated to a gateway.

       CacheUsedPercentage -> (double)
          Percent use of the gateway's cache storage. This metric applies only
          to the gateway-cached volume setup. The sample is taken at  the  end
          of the reporting period.

       CacheDirtyPercentage -> (double)
          The file share's contribution to the overall percentage of the gate-
          way's cache that has not been persisted to Amazon Web Services.  The
          sample is taken at the end of the reporting period.

       CacheHitPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          served from cache. The sample is taken at the end of  the  reporting
          period.

       CacheMissPercentage -> (double)
          Percent of application read operations from the file shares that are
          not served from cache. The sample is taken at the end of the report-
          ing period.
