CREATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()                                CREATE-SMB-FILE-SHARE()



NAME
       create-smb-file-share -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a Server Message Block (SMB) file share on an existing S3 File
       Gateway. In Storage Gateway, a file share is a file system mount  point
       backed  by Amazon S3 cloud storage. Storage Gateway exposes file shares
       using an SMB interface. This operation is only supported  for  S3  File
       Gateways.

       WARNING:
          S3 File Gateways require Security Token Service (Amazon Web Services
          STS) to be activated to enable you to create a file share. Make sure
          that Amazon Web Services STS is activated in the Amazon Web Services
          Region you are creating your S3 File Gateway in. If Amazon Web  Ser-
          vices STS is not activated in this Amazon Web Services Region, acti-
          vate it. For information about how to activate Amazon  Web  Services
          STS,  see  Activating and deactivating Amazon Web Services STS in an
          Amazon Web Services Region in the  Identity  and  Access  Management
          User Guide .

          File  gateways  don't  support  creating hard or symbolic links on a
          file share.

OPTIONS
       --client-token (string)
          A unique string value that you supply that is used by S3 File  Gate-
          way to ensure idempotent file share creation.

       --gateway-arn (string)
          The  ARN  of  the S3 File Gateway on which you want to create a file
          share.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set to true to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption  with  your  own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master key
          (CMK) used for Amazon S3  server-side  encryption.  Storage  Gateway
          does  not  support  asymmetric CMKs. This value can only be set when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --role (string)
          The ARN of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that an  S3
          File Gateway assumes when it accesses the underlying storage.

       --location-arn (string)
          A  custom ARN for the backend storage used for storing data for file
          shares. It includes a resource ARN with an optional prefix  concate-
          nation. The prefix must end with a forward slash (/).

          NOTE:
              You can specify LocationARN as a bucket ARN, access point ARN or
              access point alias, as shown in the following examples.

              Bucket ARN:
                 arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/prefix/

              Access point ARN:
                 arn:aws:s3:region:account-id:accesspoint/ac-
                 cess-point-name/prefix/

              If  you  specify an access point, the bucket policy must be con-
              figured to delegate access control to the access point. For  in-
              formation, see Delegating access control to access points in the
              Amazon S3 User Guide .

              Access point alias:
                 test-ap-ab123cdef4gehijklmn5opqrstuvuse1a-s3alias

       --default-storage-class (string)
          The default storage class for objects put into an Amazon  S3  bucket
          by  the S3 File Gateway. The default value is S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING
          . Optional.

          Valid Values: S3_STANDARD | S3_INTELLIGENT_TIERING |  S3_STANDARD_IA
          | S3_ONEZONE_IA

       --object-acl (string)
          A  value  that sets the access control list (ACL) permission for ob-
          jects in the S3 bucket that a S3 File Gateway puts objects into. The
          default value is private .

          Possible values:

          o private

          o public-read

          o public-read-write

          o authenticated-read

          o bucket-owner-read

          o bucket-owner-full-control

          o aws-exec-read

       --read-only | --no-read-only (boolean)
          A  value  that sets the write status of a file share. Set this value
          to true to set the write status to read-only, otherwise set to false
          .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --guess-mime-type-enabled | --no-guess-mime-type-enabled (boolean)
          A  value that enables guessing of the MIME type for uploaded objects
          based on file extensions. Set this value to true to enable MIME type
          guessing, otherwise set to false . The default value is true .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --requester-pays | --no-requester-pays (boolean)
          A  value that sets who pays the cost of the request and the cost as-
          sociated with data download from the S3 bucket. If this value is set
          to  true  ,  the  requester pays the costs; otherwise, the S3 bucket
          owner pays. However, the S3 bucket owner always  pays  the  cost  of
          storing data.

          NOTE:
              RequesterPays  is  a  configuration for the S3 bucket that backs
              the file share, so make sure that the configuration on the  file
              share is the same as the S3 bucket configuration.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --smbacl-enabled | --no-smbacl-enabled (boolean)
          Set  this  value  to true to enable access control list (ACL) on the
          SMB file share. Set it to false to map file  and  directory  permis-
          sions to the POSIX permissions.

          For  more  information,  see Using Microsoft Windows ACLs to control
          access to an SMB file share in the Storage Gateway User Guide .

          Valid Values: true | false

       --access-based-enumeration | --no-access-based-enumeration (boolean)
          The files and folders on this share will only be  visible  to  users
          with read access.

       --admin-user-list (list)
          A  list  of  users  or  groups  in the Active Directory that will be
          granted administrator privileges on the file share. These users  can
          do  all  file  operations  as the super-user. Acceptable formats in-
          clude: DOMAIN\User1 , user1 , @group1 , and @DOMAIN\group1 .

          WARNING:
              Use this option very carefully, because any user  in  this  list
              can  do anything they like on the file share, regardless of file
              permissions.

          (string)

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --file-share-name (string)
          The name of the file share. Optional.

          NOTE:
              FileShareName must be set if an S3 prefix name is set  in  Loca-
              tionARN , or if an access point or access point alias is used.

       --cache-attributes (structure)
          Specifies refresh cache information for the file share.

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)
              Refreshes  a file share's cache by using Time To Live (TTL). TTL
              is the length of time since the last refresh after which  access
              to  the  directory would cause the file gateway to first refresh
              that directory's contents from the Amazon S3  bucket  or  Amazon
              FSx file system. The TTL duration is in seconds.

              Valid Values:0, 300 to 2,592,000 seconds (5 minutes to 30 days)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "CacheStaleTimeoutInSeconds": integer
          }

       --notification-policy (string)
          The  notification  policy  of  the file share. SettlingTimeInSeconds
          controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in  time
          a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notifi-
          cation. Because clients can make many small writes  to  files,  it's
          best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generat-
          ing multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.

          NOTE:
              SettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the  object
              uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.

          The  following  example  sets  NotificationPolicy  on with Settling-
          TimeInSeconds set to 60.
              {\"Upload\": {\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\": 60}}

          The following example sets NotificationPolicy off.
              {}

       --vpc-endpoint-dns-name (string)
          Specifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file  share
          uses to connect to Amazon S3.

          NOTE:
              This  parameter  is required for SMB file shares that connect to
              Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an  ac-
              cess point alias that points to a VPC access point.

       --bucket-region (string)
          Specifies  the  Region  of  the  S3  bucket where the SMB file share
          stores files.

          NOTE:
              This parameter is required for SMB file shares that  connect  to
              Amazon  S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an ac-
              cess point alias that points to a VPC access point.

       --oplocks-enabled | --no-oplocks-enabled (boolean)
          Specifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB  file
          share.

          NOTE:
              Enabling  opportunistic  locking on case-sensitive shares is not
              recommended for workloads that involve access to files with  the
              same name in different case.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       FileShareARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the newly created file share.
