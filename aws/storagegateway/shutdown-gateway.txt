SHUTDOWN-GATEWAY()                                          SHUTDOWN-GATEWAY()



NAME
       shutdown-gateway -

DESCRIPTION
       Shuts  down  a  gateway. To specify which gateway to shut down, use the
       Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway in the body of your request.

       The operation shuts down the gateway service component running  in  the
       gateway's virtual machine (VM) and not the host VM.

       NOTE:
          If  you  want  to shut down the VM, it is recommended that you first
          shut down the gateway component in the  VM  to  avoid  unpredictable
          conditions.

       After  the  gateway  is  shutdown, you cannot call any other API except
       StartGateway ,  DescribeGatewayInformation , and   ListGateways  .  For
       more  information, see  ActivateGateway . Your applications cannot read
       from or write to the gateway's storage volumes, and there are no  snap-
       shots taken.

       NOTE:
          When  you make a shutdown request, you will get a 200 OK success re-
          sponse immediately. However, it might take some time for the gateway
          to  shut  down.  You can call the  DescribeGatewayInformation API to
          check the status. For more information, see  ActivateGateway .

       If do not intend to use the gateway again, you must delete the  gateway
       (using   DeleteGateway  )  to no longer pay software charges associated
       with the gateway.

SYNOPSIS
            shutdown-gateway
          --gateway-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       GatewayARN -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.
