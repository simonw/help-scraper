LIST-FILE-SYSTEM-ASSOCIATIONS()                LIST-FILE-SYSTEM-ASSOCIATIONS()



NAME
       list-file-system-associations -

DESCRIPTION
       Gets  a  list of FileSystemAssociationSummary objects. Each object con-
       tains a summary of a file system association. This  operation  is  only
       supported for FSx File Gateways.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-file-system-associations  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: FileSystemAssociationSummaryList

SYNOPSIS
            list-file-system-associations
          [--gateway-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation  to  return a list of gateways for your account and Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Marker -> (string)
          If  the request includes Marker , the response returns that value in
          this field.

       NextMarker -> (string)
          If a value is present, there are more file  system  associations  to
          return.  In  a  subsequent  request, use NextMarker as the value for
          Marker to retrieve the next set of file system associations.

       FileSystemAssociationSummaryList -> (list)
          An array of information about the Amazon FSx gateway's  file  system
          associations.

          (structure)
              Gets  the  summary returned by ListFileSystemAssociation , which
              is a summary of a created file system association.

              FileSystemAssociationId -> (string)
                 The ID of the file system association.

              FileSystemAssociationARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  file  system  associa-
                 tion.

              FileSystemAssociationStatus -> (string)
                 The  status of the file share. Valid Values: AVAILABLE | CRE-
                 ATING | DELETING | FORCE_DELETING | UPDATING | ERROR

              GatewayARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  List-
                 Gateways  operation to return a list of gateways for your ac-
                 count and Amazon Web Services Region.
