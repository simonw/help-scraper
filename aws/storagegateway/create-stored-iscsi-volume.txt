CREATE-STORED-ISCSI-VOLUME()                      CREATE-STORED-ISCSI-VOLUME()



NAME
       create-stored-iscsi-volume -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  volume  on a specified gateway. This operation is only sup-
       ported in the stored volume gateway type.

       The size of the volume to create is inferred from the  disk  size.  You
       can choose to preserve existing data on the disk, create volume from an
       existing snapshot, or create an empty volume. If you choose  to  create
       an empty gateway volume, then any existing data on the disk is erased.

       In  the  request, you must specify the gateway and the disk information
       on which you are creating the volume. In response, the gateway  creates
       the volume and returns volume information such as the volume Amazon Re-
       source Name (ARN), its size, and the iSCSI target ARN  that  initiators
       can use to connect to the volume target.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

          --gateway-arn <value>
          --disk-id <value>
          [--snapshot-id <value>]
          --preserve-existing-data | --no-preserve-existing-data
          --target-name <value>
          --network-interface-id <value>
          [--kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted]
          [--kms-key <value>]

          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --gateway-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the gateway. Use the  ListGateways
          operation to return a list of gateways for your account  and  Amazon
          Web Services Region.

       --disk-id (string)
          The  unique identifier for the gateway local disk that is configured
          as a stored volume. Use ListLocalDisks to list disk IDs for a  gate-
          way.

       --snapshot-id (string)
          The  snapshot  ID (e.g., "snap-1122aabb") of the snapshot to restore
          as the new stored volume. Specify this field if you want  to  create
          the  iSCSI storage volume from a snapshot; otherwise, do not include
          this field. To list snapshots for your account use DescribeSnapshots
          in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud API Reference .

       --preserve-existing-data | --no-preserve-existing-data (boolean)
          Set to true if you want to preserve the data on the local disk. Oth-
          erwise, set to false to create an empty volume.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --target-name (string)
          The name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to  connect  to  a
          volume  and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For example, speci-
          fying  TargetName  as  myvolume  results  in  the  target   ARN   of
          arn:aws:storagegateway:us-east-2:111122223333:gate-
          way/sgw-12A3456B/target/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target
          name must be unique across all volumes on a gateway.

          If  you  don't  specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the value that
          was previously used for this volume as the new target name.

       --network-interface-id (string)
          The network interface of the gateway on which to  expose  the  iSCSI
          target. Only IPv4 addresses are accepted. Use  DescribeGatewayInfor-
          mation to get a list of the network interfaces available on a  gate-
          way.

          Valid Values: A valid IP address.

       --kms-encrypted | --no-kms-encrypted (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to use Amazon S3 server-side encryption with your own
          KMS key, or false to use a key managed by Amazon S3. Optional.

          Valid Values: true | false

       --kms-key (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric  customer  master  key
          (CMK)  used  for  Amazon  S3 server-side encryption. Storage Gateway
          does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only  be  set  when
          KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  up  to 50 tags that can be assigned to a stored volume.
          Each tag is a key-value pair.

          NOTE:
              Valid characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and num-
              bers  representable  in  UTF-8 format, and the following special
              characters: + - = . _ : / @. The maximum length of a  tag's  key
              is  128  characters, and the maximum length for a tag's value is
              256.

          (structure)
              A key-value pair that helps you manage, filter, and  search  for
              your  resource.  Allowed  characters:  letters, white space, and
              numbers, representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: +
              - = . _ : /.

              Key -> (string)
                 Tag key. The key can't start with aws:.

              Value -> (string)
                 Value of the tag key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
