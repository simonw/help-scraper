NAME
       describe-stored-iscsi-volumes -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  description  of  the gateway volumes specified in the re-
       quest. The list of gateway volumes in the  request  must  be  from  one
       gateway.  In  the  response, Storage Gateway returns volume information
       sorted by volume ARNs. This operation is only supported in stored  vol-
       ume gateway type.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stored-iscsi-volumes
          --volume-arns <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --volume-arns (list)
          An array of strings where each string represents the Amazon Resource
          Name (ARN) of a stored volume. All of the specified  stored  volumes
          must  be  from the same gateway. Use  ListVolumes to get volume ARNs
          for a gateway.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       StorediSCSIVolumes -> (list)
          Describes a single unit of output from  DescribeStorediSCSIVolumes .
          The following fields are returned:

          o ChapEnabled  :  Indicates  whether  mutual CHAP is enabled for the
            iSCSI target.

          o LunNumber : The logical disk number.

          o NetworkInterfaceId : The network interface ID of the stored volume
            that initiator use to map the stored volume as an iSCSI target.

          o NetworkInterfacePort  :  The  port  used to communicate with iSCSI
            targets.

          o PreservedExistingData : Indicates when the stored volume was  cre-
            ated, existing data on the underlying local disk was preserved.

          o SourceSnapshotId  :  If the stored volume was created from a snap-
            shot, this field contains the snapshot ID used, e.g. snap-1122aabb
            . Otherwise, this field is not included.

          o StorediSCSIVolumes  :  An array of StorediSCSIVolume objects where
            each object contains metadata about one stored volume.

          o TargetARN : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

          o VolumeARN : The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the stored volume.

          o VolumeDiskId : The disk ID of the local disk that was specified in
            the  CreateStorediSCSIVolume operation.

            resents a collection of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

          o VolumeProgress  : Represents the percentage complete if the volume
            is restoring or bootstrapping that represents the percent of  data
            transferred.  This  field  does  not appear in the response if the
            stored volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

          o VolumeSizeInBytes : The size of the volume in bytes.

          o VolumeStatus : One of the VolumeStatus values that  indicates  the
            state of the volume.

          o VolumeType  : One of the enumeration values describing the type of
            the volume. Currently, only STORED volumes are supported.

          (structure)
              Describes an iSCSI stored volume.

              VolumeARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the storage volume.

              VolumeId -> (string)
                 The unique identifier of the volume, e.g., vol-AE4B946D.

              VolumeType -> (string)

                 One  of  the  VolumeStatus values that indicates the state of
                 the storage volume.

              VolumeAttachmentStatus -> (string)
                 A value that indicates whether a storage volume  is  attached
                 to,  detached  from, or is in the process of detaching from a
                 gateway. For more information, see Moving your volumes  to  a
                 different gateway .

              VolumeSizeInBytes -> (long)
                 The size of the volume in bytes.

              VolumeProgress -> (double)
                 Represents the percentage complete if the volume is restoring
                 or bootstrapping that represents the percent of  data  trans-
                 ferred.  This  field  does  not appear in the response if the
                 stored volume is not restoring or bootstrapping.

              VolumeDiskId -> (string)
                 The ID of the local disk that was specified in  the   Create-
                 StorediSCSIVolume operation.

              SourceSnapshotId -> (string)
                 If  the stored volume was created from a snapshot, this field
                 contains the snapshot ID used, e.g. snap-78e22663. Otherwise,
                 this field is not included.

              PreservedExistingData -> (boolean)
                 Indicates  if  when  the  stored volume was created, existing
                 data on the underlying local disk was preserved.

                 Valid Values: true | false

              VolumeiSCSIAttributes -> (structure)
                 An  VolumeiSCSIAttributes object that represents a collection
                 of iSCSI attributes for one stored volume.

                 TargetARN -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the volume target.

                 NetworkInterfaceId -> (string)
                     The network interface identifier.

                 NetworkInterfacePort -> (integer)
                     The port used to communicate with iSCSI targets.

                 LunNumber -> (integer)
                     The logical disk number.

                 ChapEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicates  whether  mutual  CHAP is enabled for the iSCSI
                     target.

              CreatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the volume was created.  Volumes  created  prior  to
                 March 28, 2017 dont have this timestamp.

              VolumeUsedInBytes -> (long)
                 The  size  of  the  data  stored on the volume in bytes. This
                 value is calculated based on the number of  blocks  that  are
                 touched,  instead  of the actual amount of data written. This
                 value can be useful for sequential write  patterns  but  less
                 accurate for random write patterns. VolumeUsedInBytes is dif-
                 ferent from the compressed size of the volume, which  is  the
                 value that is used to calculate your bill.

                 NOTE:
                     This  value is not available for volumes created prior to
                     May 13, 2015, until you store data on the volume.

              KMSKey -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a symmetric customer master
                 key  (CMK) used for Amazon S3 server-side encryption. Storage
                 Gateway does not support asymmetric CMKs. This value can only
                 be set when KMSEncrypted is true . Optional.

              TargetName -> (string)
                 The  name of the iSCSI target used by an initiator to connect
                 to a volume and used as a suffix for the target ARN. For  ex-
                 ample,  specifying TargetName as myvolume results in the tar-
                 get           ARN           of           arn:aws:storagegate-
                 way:us-east-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/tar-
                 get/iqn.1997-05.com.amazon:myvolume . The target name must be
                 unique across all volumes on a gateway.

                 If  you don't specify a value, Storage Gateway uses the value
                 that was previously used for this volume as  the  new  target
                 name.
