SEND-COMMAND()                                                  SEND-COMMAND()



NAME
       send-command -

DESCRIPTION
       Sends a command to an Amazon QLDB ledger.

       NOTE:
          Instead  of  interacting  directly with this API, we recommend using
          the QLDB driver or the QLDB shell to execute data transactions on  a
          ledger.

          o If  you  are  working  with  an  AWS SDK, use the QLDB driver. The
            driver provides a high-level abstraction  layer  above  this  QLDB
            Session  data plane and manages SendCommand API calls for you. For
            information and a list of  supported  programming  languages,  see
            Getting started with the driver in the Amazon QLDB Developer Guide
            .

          o If you are working with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS  CLI),
            use  the  QLDB  shell.  The shell is a command line interface that
            uses the QLDB driver to interact with a ledger.  For  information,
            see Accessing Amazon QLDB using the QLDB shell .

OPTIONS
       --session-token (string)
          Specifies the session token for the current command. A session token
          is constant throughout the life of the session.

          To obtain a session token, run the StartSession command.  This  Ses-
          sionToken  is  required  for every subsequent command that is issued
          during the current session.

       --start-session (structure)
          Command to start a new session. A session token is obtained as  part
          of the response.

          LedgerName -> (string)
              The name of the ledger to start a new session against.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LedgerName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LedgerName": "string"
          }

       --start-transaction (structure)
          Command to start a new transaction.

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          }

       --end-session (structure)
          Command to end the current session.

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          }

       --commit-transaction (structure)
          Command to commit the specified transaction.

          TransactionId -> (string)
              Specifies the transaction ID of the transaction to commit.

          CommitDigest -> (blob)
              Specifies  the  commit digest for the transaction to commit. For
              every active transaction, the commit digest must be passed. QLDB
              validates  CommitDigest  and rejects the commit with an error if
              the digest computed on the client does not match the digest com-
              puted by QLDB.

              The purpose of the CommitDigest parameter is to ensure that QLDB
              commits a transaction if and only if the  server  has  processed
              the  exact set of statements sent by the client, in the same or-
              der that client sent them, and with no duplicates.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransactionId=string,CommitDigest=blob

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransactionId": "string",

          }

       --abort-transaction (structure)
          Command to abort the current transaction.

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          }

       --execute-statement (structure)
          Command to execute a statement in the specified transaction.

          TransactionId -> (string)
              Specifies the transaction ID of the request.

          Statement -> (string)
              Specifies the statement of the request.

          Parameters -> (list)
              Specifies the parameters for the parameterized statement in  the
              request.

              (structure)

                 formats.

                 IonText -> (string)
                     An  Amazon Ion plaintext value contained in a ValueHolder
                     structure.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TransactionId=string,Statement=string,Parameters=[{IonBinary=blob,IonText=string},{IonBinary=blob,IonText=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TransactionId": "string",
            "Statement": "string",
            "Parameters": [
              {
                "IonBinary": blob,
                "IonText": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --fetch-page (structure)
          Command to fetch a page.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
