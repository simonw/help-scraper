SEARCH-DEVICES()                                              SEARCH-DEVICES()



NAME
       search-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches devices and lists the ones that meet a set of filter criteria.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-devices  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Devices

          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filters to use to list a specified  set  of  devices.  Supported
          filter  keys  are  DeviceName, DeviceStatus, DeviceStatusDetailCode,
          RoomName, DeviceType, DeviceSerialNumber, UnassociatedOnly,  Connec-
          tionStatus  (ONLINE  and  OFFLINE),  NetworkProfileName, NetworkPro-
          fileArn, Feature, and FailureCode.

          (structure)
              A filter name and value pair that is used to return a more  spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to match a set of re-
              sources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The sort order to use in listing the specified set of devices.  Sup-
          ported sort keys are DeviceName, DeviceStatus, RoomName, DeviceType,
          DeviceSerialNumber,   ConnectionStatus,   NetworkProfileName,   Net-
          workProfileArn, Feature, and FailureCode.

          (structure)
              An object representing a sort criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The sort key of a sort object.

              Value -> (string)
                 The sort value of a sort object.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "ASC"|"DESC"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
