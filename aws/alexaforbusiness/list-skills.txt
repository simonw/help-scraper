NAME
       list-skills -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all enabled skills in a specific skill group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-skills  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: SkillSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-skills
          [--skill-group-arn <value>]
          [--enablement-type <value>]
          [--skill-type <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --skill-group-arn (string)
          The ARN of the skill group for which to list enabled skills.

       --enablement-type (string)
          Whether the skill is enabled under the user's account.

          Possible values:

          o ENABLED

          o PENDING

       --skill-type (string)
          Whether the skill is publicly available or is a private skill.

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

          o ALL

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       SkillSummaries -> (list)
          The list of enabled skills requested. Required.

          (structure)

              SkillName -> (string)
                 The name of the skill.

              SupportsLinking -> (boolean)
                 Linking support for a skill.

              EnablementType -> (string)
                 Whether the skill is enabled under the user's account, or  if
                 it requires linking to be used.

              SkillType -> (string)
                 Whether  the  skill  is  publicly  available  or is a private
