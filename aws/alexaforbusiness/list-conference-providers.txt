LIST-CONFERENCE-PROVIDERS()                        LIST-CONFERENCE-PROVIDERS()



NAME
       list-conference-providers -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists conference providers under a specific AWS account.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-conference-providers  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You
       can  disable  pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When
       using --output text and the --query argument on a  paginated  response,
       the  --query argument must extract data from the results of the follow-
       ing query expressions: ConferenceProviders

SYNOPSIS
            list-conference-providers
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ConferenceProviders -> (list)
          The conference providers.

          (structure)
              An entity that provides a conferencing solution. Alexa for Busi-
              ness  acts  as  the  voice  interface and mediator that connects
              users to their preferred conference provider. Examples  of  con-
              ference  providers  include Amazon Chime, Zoom, Cisco, and Poly-
              com.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the newly created conference provider.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the conference provider.

              Type -> (string)
                 The type of conference providers.

              IPDialIn -> (structure)
                 The IP endpoint and protocol for calling.

                 Endpoint -> (string)
                     The IP address.

                 CommsProtocol -> (string)
                     The protocol, including SIP, SIPS, and H323.

              PSTNDialIn -> (structure)
                 The information for PSTN conferencing.

                 CountryCode -> (string)
                     The zip code.

                 PhoneNumber -> (string)
                     The phone number to call to join the conference.

                 OneClickIdDelay -> (string)
                     The delay duration before Alexa enters the conference  ID
                     with dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF). Each number on the
                     dial pad corresponds to a DTMF tone, which is how we send
                     data over the telephone network.

                 OneClickPinDelay -> (string)
                     The delay duration before Alexa enters the conference pin
                     with dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF). Each number on the
                     dial pad corresponds to a DTMF tone, which is how we send
                     data over the telephone network.

              MeetingSetting -> (structure)
                 The meeting settings for the conference provider.

                 RequirePin -> (string)
                     The values that indicate whether the pin  is  always  re-
                     quired.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The tokens used for pagination.
