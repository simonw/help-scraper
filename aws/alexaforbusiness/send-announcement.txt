SYNOPSIS
            send-announcement
          --room-filters <value>
          --content <value>
          [--time-to-live-in-seconds <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --room-filters (list)
          The filters to use to send an announcement to a  specified  list  of
          rooms. The supported filter keys are RoomName, ProfileName, RoomArn,
          and ProfileArn. To send to all rooms, specify an  empty  RoomFilters
          list.

          (structure)
              A  filter name and value pair that is used to return a more spe-
              cific list of results. Filters can be used to match a set of re-
              sources by various criteria.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of a filter.

              Values -> (list)
                 The values of a filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --content (structure)
          The  announcement  content.  This  can contain only one of the three
          possible announcement types (text, SSML or audio).

          TextList -> (list)
              The list of text messages.

              (structure)
                 The text message.

                 Locale -> (string)
                     The locale of the text message. Currently, en-US is  sup-
                     ported.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the text message.

          SsmlList -> (list)
              The list of SSML messages.

              (structure)
                 The SSML message. For more information, see SSML Reference .

                 Locale -> (string)
                     The  locale of the SSML message. Currently, en-US is sup-
                     ported.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the SSML message in the correct SSML format.
                     The audio tag is not supported.

          AudioList -> (list)
              The list of audio messages.

              (structure)
                 The  audio  message.  There is a 1 MB limit on the audio file
                 input and the only supported format is MP3. To  convert  your
                 MP3 audio files to an Alexa-friendly,

                 required  codec  version  (MPEG  version  2) and bit rate (48
                 kbps), you might use converter software. One option for  this
                 is  a  command-line  tool,  FFmpeg. For more information, see
                 FFmpeg . The following command  converts  the  provided  <in-
                 put-file> to an MP3 file that is played in the announcement:
                     ffmpeg -i <input-file> -ac 2 -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 48k
                     -ar 16000 <output-file.mp3>

                 Locale -> (string)
                     The locale of the audio message. Currently, en-US is sup-
                     ported.

                 Location -> (string)
                     The  location  of  the audio file. Currently, S3 URLs are
                     supported. Only S3 locations comprised of safe characters
                     are valid. For more information, see Safe Characters .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          TextList=[{Locale=string,Value=string},{Locale=string,Value=string}],SsmlList=[{Locale=string,Value=string},{Locale=string,Value=string}],AudioList=[{Locale=string,Location=string},{Locale=string,Location=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "TextList": [
              {
                "Locale": "en-US",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "SsmlList": [
              {
                "Locale": "en-US",
                "Value": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "AudioList": [
              {
                "Locale": "en-US",
                "Location": "string"
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --time-to-live-in-seconds (integer)
          The  time  to  live for an announcement. Default is 300. If delivery
          doesn't occur within this time, the announcement is not delivered.

       --client-request-token (string)
          The unique, user-specified identifier for the request  that  ensures
          idempotency.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AnnouncementArn -> (string)
          The identifier of the announcement.
