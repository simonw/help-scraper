GET-APP-MONITOR()                                            GET-APP-MONITOR()



NAME
       get-app-monitor -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves the complete configuration information for one app monitor.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-app-monitor
          --name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The app monitor to retrieve information for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       AppMonitor -> (structure)
          A structure containing all the configuration information for the app
          monitor.

          AppMonitorConfiguration -> (structure)
              A structure that contains much of the configuration data for the
              app monitor.

              AllowCookies -> (boolean)
                 If you set this to true , the RUM web client sets  two  cook-
                 ies,  a  session  cookie and a user cookie. The cookies allow
                 the RUM web client to collect data relating to the number  of
                 users  an application has and the behavior of the application
                 across a sequence  of  events.  Cookies  are  stored  in  the
                 top-level domain of the current page.

              EnableXRay -> (boolean)
                 If  you  set this to true , RUM enables X-Ray tracing for the
                 user sessions that RUM  samples.  RUM  adds  an  X-Ray  trace
                 header  to  allowed  HTTP  requests. It also records an X-Ray
                 segment for allowed HTTP requests. You  can  see  traces  and
                 segments  from  these  user sessions in the X-Ray console and
                 the CloudWatch ServiceLens console. For more information, see
                 What is X-Ray?

              ExcludedPages -> (list)
                 A list of URLs in your website or application to exclude from
                 RUM data collection.

                 You can't include both ExcludedPages and IncludedPages in the
                 same operation.

                 (string)

              FavoritePages -> (list)
                 A  list of pages in the CloudWatch RUM console that are to be
                 displayed with a "favorite" icon.

                 (string)

              GuestRoleArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the guest IAM role that is attached to the  Amazon
                 Cognito  identity  pool that is used to authorize the sending
                 of data to RUM.

              IdentityPoolId -> (string)
                 The ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool that  is  used  to
                 authorize the sending of data to RUM.

              IncludedPages -> (list)
                 If  this  app  monitor  is  to collect data from only certain
                 pages in your application, this structure lists those pages.
                     <p>You can't include both <code>ExcludedPages</code>  and
                     <code>IncludedPages</code> in the same operation.</p>

                 (string)

              SessionSampleRate -> (double)
                 Specifies the percentage of user sessions to use for RUM data
                 collection. Choosing a higher percentage gives you more  data
                 but also incurs more costs.

                 The  number  you  specify  is the percentage of user sessions
                 that will be used.

                 If you omit this parameter, the default of 10 is used.

              Telemetries -> (list)
                 An array that lists the types of telemetry data that this app
                 monitor is to collect.

                 o errors  indicates  that  RUM  collects data about unhandled
                   JavaScript errors raised by your application.

                 o performance indicates that RUM  collects  performance  data
                   about how your application and its resources are loaded and
                   rendered. This includes Core Web Vitals.

                 o http indicates that RUM collects  data  about  HTTP  errors
                   thrown by your application.

              using CloudWatch Logs.

              CwLog -> (structure)
                 A  structure  that contains the information about whether the
                 app monitor stores copies of the data that  RUM  collects  in
                 CloudWatch Logs. If it does, this structure also contains the
                 name of the log group.

                 CwLogEnabled -> (boolean)
                     Indicated whether the app monitor stores  copies  of  the
