NAME
       list-tables -

DESCRIPTION
       A  list of tables, along with the name, status and retention properties
       of each table. See code sample for details.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-tables
          [--database-name <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --next-token (string)
          The pagination token. To resume pagination,  provide  the  NextToken
          value as argument of a subsequent API invocation.

       --max-results (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the output. If the total num-
          ber of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken
          is provided in the output. To resume pagination, provide the NextTo-
          ken value as argument of a subsequent API invocation.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Tables -> (list)
          A list of tables.

          (structure)
              Table represents a database table in Timestream. Tables  contain
              one  or  more  related time series. You can modify the retention
              duration of the memory store and the magnetic store for a table.

              Arn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name that uniquely identifies this table.

              TableName -> (string)
                 The name of the Timestream table.

              DatabaseName -> (string)
                 The name of the Timestream database that contains this table.

              TableStatus -> (string)
                 The current state of the table:

                 o DELETING - The table is being deleted.

                 o ACTIVE - The table is ready for use.

              RetentionProperties -> (structure)
                 The retention duration for  the  memory  store  and  magnetic
                 store.

                 MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours -> (long)
                     The  duration for which data must be stored in the memory
                     store.

                 MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays -> (long)
                     The duration for which data must be stored  in  the  mag-
                     netic store.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the Timestream table was created.

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The time when the Timestream table was last updated.

              MagneticStoreWriteProperties -> (structure)
                 Contains  properties  to  set on the table when enabling mag-
                 netic store writes.

                 EnableMagneticStoreWrites -> (boolean)
                     A flag to enable magnetic store writes.

                 MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation -> (structure)
                     The location to write error reports for records  rejected
                     asynchronously during magnetic store writes.

                     S3Configuration -> (structure)
                        Configuration of an S3 location to write error reports
                        for records rejected, asynchronously, during  magnetic
                        store writes.

                        BucketName -> (string)
                            >Bucket name of the customer S3 bucket.

                        ObjectKeyPrefix -> (string)
                            Object key preview for the customer S3 location.

                        EncryptionOption -> (string)
                            Encryption  option  for  the customer s3 location.
                            Options are S3  server  side  encryption  with  an
                            S3-managed key or KMS managed key.

                        KmsKeyId -> (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.
