CREATE-TABLE()                                                  CREATE-TABLE()



NAME
       create-table -

DESCRIPTION
       The  CreateTable  operation adds a new table to an existing database in
       your account. In an Amazon Web Services account, table names must be at
       least  unique  within each Region if they are in the same database. You
       may have identical table names in the same Region if the tables are  in
       separate  databases. While creating the table, you must specify the ta-
       ble name, database name, and the retention properties.  Service  quotas
       apply . See code sample for details.

          The name of the Timestream database.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream table.

       --retention-properties (structure)
          The  duration  for which your time series data must be stored in the
          memory store and the magnetic store.

          MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours -> (long)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          MemoryStoreRetentionPeriodInHours=long,MagneticStoreRetentionPeriodInDays=long

       JSON Syntax:

          {

          A list of key-value pairs to label the table.

          (structure)
              A tag is a label that you assign to a Timestream database and/or
              table. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of
              which you define. Tags enable you to categorize databases and/or
              tables, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment.

              Key -> (string)
                 The key of the tag. Tag keys are case sensitive.

              Value -> (string)

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON

       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
