WRITE-RECORDS()                                                WRITE-RECORDS()



NAME
       write-records -

DESCRIPTION
       The  WriteRecords  operation enables you to write your time series data
       into Timestream. You can specify a single data point or a batch of data
       points  to  be  inserted  into the system. Timestream offers you with a
       flexible schema that auto detects the column names and data  types  for
       your  Timestream  tables based on the dimension names and data types of
       the data points you specify when invoking  writes  into  the  database.
       Timestream support eventual consistency read semantics. This means that
       when you query data immediately after writing  a  batch  of  data  into
       Timestream,  the  query  results might not reflect the results of a re-
       cently completed write operation. The results  may  also  include  some
       stale data. If you repeat the query request after a short time, the re-
       sults should return the latest data. Service quotas apply .

       See code sample for details.
          Upserts

       You can use the Version parameter in a WriteRecords request  to  update
       data  points. Timestream tracks a version number with each record. Ver-
       sion defaults to 1 when not specified for the record  in  the  request.
       Timestream will update an existing records measure value along with its
       Version upon receiving a write request with a higher Version number for
       that  record.  Upon receiving an update request where the measure value
       is the same as that of the existing record,  Timestream  still  updates
       Version , if it is greater than the existing value of Version . You can
       update a data point as many times as desired, as long as the  value  of
       Version continuously increases.

       For  example, suppose you write a new record without indicating Version
       in the request. Timestream will store this record, and set Version to 1
       .  Now,  suppose  you try to update this record with a WriteRecords re-
       quest of the same record with a different measure value but,  like  be-
       fore,  do  not  provide  Version . In this case, Timestream will reject
       this update with a RejectedRecordsException since the  updated  records
       version  is not greater than the existing value of Version. However, if
       you were to  resend  the  update  request  with  Version  set  to  2  ,
       Timestream  would  then  succeed in updating the records value, and the
       Version would be set to 2 . Next, suppose you sent a  WriteRecords  re-
       quest  with  this  same record and an identical measure value, but with
       Version set to 3 . In this case, Timestream would only  update  Version
       to  3 . Any further updates would need to send a version number greater
       than 3 , or the update requests would receive  a  RejectedRecordsExcep-
       tion .

SYNOPSIS
            write-records
          --database-name <value>
          --table-name <value>
          [--common-attributes <value>]
          --records <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --database-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream database.

       --table-name (string)
          The name of the Timestream table.

       --common-attributes (structure)
          A record containing the common measure, dimension, time, and version
          attributes shared across all the records in the request. The measure
          and  dimension  attributes specified will be merged with the measure
          and dimension attributes in the records  object  when  the  data  is
          written  into  Timestream.  Dimensions may not overlap, or a Valida-
          tionException will be thrown. In other words, a record must  contain
          dimensions with unique names.

          Dimensions -> (list)
              Contains the list of dimensions for time series data points.

              (structure)
                 Dimension represents the meta data attributes of the time se-
                 ries. For example, the name and availability zone of  an  EC2
                 instance  or  the  name of the manufacturer of a wind turbine
                 are dimensions.

                 Name -> (string)
                     Dimension represents the meta data attributes of the time
                     series. For example, the name and availability zone of an
                     EC2 instance or the name of the manufacturer  of  a  wind
                     turbine are dimensions.

                     For  constraints  on  Dimension  names,  see  Naming Con-
                     straints .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value of the dimension.

                 DimensionValueType -> (string)
                     The data type of the dimension for the time  series  data
                     point.

          MeasureName -> (string)
              Measure  represents  the  data attribute of the time series. For
              example, the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance or the RPM of  a
              wind turbine are measures.

          MeasureValue -> (string)
              Contains the measure value for the time series data point.

          MeasureValueType -> (string)
              Contains  the data type of the measure value for the time series
              data point. Default type is DOUBLE .

          Time -> (string)
              Contains the time at which the measure value for the data  point
              was  collected.  The  time value plus the unit provides the time
              elapsed since the epoch. For example, if the time value is 12345
              and the unit is ms , then 12345 ms have elapsed since the epoch.

          TimeUnit -> (string)
              The  granularity of the timestamp unit. It indicates if the time
              value is in seconds, milliseconds,  nanoseconds  or  other  sup-
              ported values. Default is MILLISECONDS .

          Version -> (long)
              64-bit attribute used for record updates. Write requests for du-
              plicate data with a higher version number will update the exist-
              ing  measure value and version. In cases where the measure value
              is the same, Version will still be updated . Default value is  1
              .

              NOTE:
                 Version  must  be 1 or greater, or you will receive a Valida-
                 tionException error.

          MeasureValues -> (list)
              Contains the list of MeasureValue for time series data points.

              This is only allowed for type MULTI .  For  scalar  values,  use
              MeasureValue attribute of the Record directly.

              (structure)
                 MeasureValue  represents  the  data attribute of the time se-
                 ries. For example, the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance  or
                 the RPM of a wind turbine are measures. MeasureValue has both
                 name and value.

                 MeasureValue is only allowed for type  MULTI  .  Using  MULTI
                 type,  you  can pass multiple data attributes associated with
                 the same time series in a single record

                 Name -> (string)
                     Name of the MeasureValue.

                     For constraints on MeasureValue names,  refer  to  Naming
                     Constraints in the Timestream developer guide.

                 Value -> (string)
                     Value for the MeasureValue.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Contains  the  data type of the MeasureValue for the time
                     series data point.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Dimensions=[{Name=string,Value=string,DimensionValueType=string},{Name=string,Value=string,DimensionValueType=string}],MeasureName=string,MeasureValue=string,MeasureValueType=string,Time=string,TimeUnit=string,Version=long,MeasureValues=[{Name=string,Value=string,Type=string},{Name=string,Value=string,Type=string}]

       JSON Syntax:

              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --records (list)
          An array of records containing the unique measure, dimension,  time,
          and version attributes for each time series data point.

          (structure)
              Record  represents  a  time series data point being written into
              Timestream. Each record contains an array of dimensions.  Dimen-
              sions  represent  the meta data attributes of a time series data
              point such as the instance name or availability zone of  an  EC2
              instance.  A  record also contains the measure name which is the
              name of the measure being collected for example the CPU utiliza-
              tion  of  an  EC2  instance.  A record also contains the measure
              value and the value type which is the data type of  the  measure
              value.  In  addition, the record contains the timestamp when the
              measure was collected that the timestamp unit  which  represents
              the granularity of the timestamp.

              Records  have  a  Version field, which is a 64-bit long that you
              can use for updating data points. Writes of a  duplicate  record
              with the same dimension, timestamp, and measure name but differ-
              ent measure value will only succeed if the Version attribute  of
              the  record  in the write request is higher than that of the ex-
              isting record. Timestream defaults to a Version of 1 for records
              without the Version field.

              Dimensions -> (list)
                 Contains the list of dimensions for time series data points.

                 (structure)
                     Dimension represents the meta data attributes of the time
                     series. For example, the name and availability zone of an
                     EC2  instance  or  the name of the manufacturer of a wind
                     turbine are dimensions.

                     Name -> (string)
                        Dimension represents the meta data attributes  of  the
                        time  series.  For  example, the name and availability
                        zone of an EC2 instance or the name  of  the  manufac-
                        turer of a wind turbine are dimensions.

                        For  constraints  on  Dimension names, see Naming Con-
                        straints .

                     Value -> (string)
                        The value of the dimension.

                     DimensionValueType -> (string)
                        The data type of the dimension  for  the  time  series
                        data point.

              MeasureName -> (string)
                 Measure represents the data attribute of the time series. For
                 example, the CPU utilization of an EC2 instance or the RPM of
                 a wind turbine are measures.

              MeasureValue -> (string)
                 Contains the measure value for the time series data point.

              MeasureValueType -> (string)
                 Contains  the data type of the measure value for the time se-
                 ries data point. Default type is DOUBLE .

              Time -> (string)
                 Contains the time at which the measure  value  for  the  data
                 point  was  collected.  The time value plus the unit provides
                 the time elapsed since the epoch. For example,  if  the  time
                 value  is  12345  and  the  unit  is  ms , then 12345 ms have
                 elapsed since the epoch.

              TimeUnit -> (string)
                 The granularity of the timestamp unit. It  indicates  if  the
                 time  value is in seconds, milliseconds, nanoseconds or other
                 supported values. Default is MILLISECONDS .

              Version -> (long)
                 64-bit attribute used for record updates. Write requests  for
                 duplicate  data  with a higher version number will update the
                 existing measure value and version. In cases where  the  mea-
                 sure  value  is the same, Version will still be updated . De-
                 fault value is 1 .

                 NOTE:
                     Version must be 1 or greater, or you will receive a Vali-
                     dationException error.

              MeasureValues -> (list)
                 Contains  the  list  of  MeasureValue  for  time  series data
                 points.

                 This is only allowed for type MULTI . For scalar values,  use
                 MeasureValue attribute of the Record directly.

                 (structure)
                     MeasureValue  represents  the  data attribute of the time
                     series. For example, the CPU utilization of  an  EC2  in-
                     stance  or  the  RPM of a wind turbine are measures. Mea-
                     sureValue has both name and value.

                     MeasureValue is only allowed for type MULTI . Using MULTI
                     type,  you  can  pass multiple data attributes associated
                     with the same time series in a single record

                     Name -> (string)
                        Name of the MeasureValue.

                        For constraints on MeasureValue names, refer to Naming
                        Constraints in the Timestream developer guide.

                     Value -> (string)

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
