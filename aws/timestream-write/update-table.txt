UPDATE-TABLE()                                                  UPDATE-TABLE()



NAME
       update-table -

DESCRIPTION
       Modifies  the retention duration of the memory store and magnetic store
       for your Timestream table. Note that the change in  retention  duration
       takes  effect  immediately. For example, if the retention period of the
       memory store was initially set to 2 hours and then changed to 24 hours,
       the  memory store will be capable of holding 24 hours of data, but will
       be populated with 24 hours of data 22 hours after this change was made.
       Timestream  does  not retrieve data from the magnetic store to populate
       the memory store.

       See code sample for details.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              S3Configuration -> (structure)
                 Configuration  of  an  S3 location to write error reports for
                 records  rejected,  asynchronously,  during  magnetic   store
                 writes.

                 EncryptionOption -> (string)
                     Encryption  option  for the customer s3 location. Options
                     are S3 server side encryption with an S3-managed  key  or
                     KMS managed key.

                 KmsKeyId -> (string)
                     KMS  key  id for the customer s3 location when encrypting
                     with a KMS managed key.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          EnableMagneticStoreWrites=boolean,MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation={S3Configuration={BucketName=string,ObjectKeyPrefix=string,EncryptionOption=string,KmsKeyId=string}}

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "EnableMagneticStoreWrites": true|false,
            "MagneticStoreRejectedDataLocation": {
              "S3Configuration": {
                "BucketName": "string",
                "ObjectKeyPrefix": "string",

            }
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
