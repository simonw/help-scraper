LIST-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITIES()                  LIST-CERTIFICATE-AUTHORITIES()



NAME
       list-certificate-authorities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the private certificate authorities that you created by using the
       CreateCertificateAuthority action.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-certificate-authorities is a  paginated  operation.  Multiple  API
       calls  may  be  issued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: CertificateAuthorities

SYNOPSIS
            list-certificate-authorities
          [--resource-owner <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --resource-owner (string)
          Use this parameter to filter the returned set of certificate author-
          ities based on their owner. The default is SELF.

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o OTHER_ACCOUNTS

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list your private certificate authorities

       The  following  list-certificate-authorities  command lists information
       about all of the private CAs in your account.

          aws acm-pca list-certificate-authorities --max-results 10

OUTPUT
       CertificateAuthorities -> (list)
          Summary information about each certificate authority you  have  cre-
          ated.

          (structure)
              Contains  information  about  your private certificate authority
              (CA). Your private CA can issue and revoke  X.509  digital  cer-
              tificates.  Digital certificates verify that the entity named in
              the certificate Subject field owns or controls  the  public  key
              contained  in  the  Subject  Public  Key  Info  field.  Call the
              CreateCertificateAuthority action to create your private CA. You
              must  then call the GetCertificateAuthorityCertificate action to
              retrieve a private CA certificate signing  request  (CSR).  Sign
              the  CSR  with your ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or
              subordinate        CA        certificate.        Call        the
              ImportCertificateAuthorityCertificate   action   to  import  the
              signed certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

              Arn -> (string)
                 Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your private  certificate  au-
                 thority        (CA).       The       format       is       ``
                 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              OwnerAccount -> (string)
                 The AWS account ID that owns the certificate authority.

              CreatedAt -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which your private CA was created.

              LastStateChangeAt -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time at which your private CA was last updated.

              Type -> (string)
                 Type of your private CA.

              Serial -> (string)
                 Serial number of your private CA.

              Status -> (string)
                 Status of your private CA.

              NotBefore -> (timestamp)
                 Date and time before which your private CA certificate is not
                 valid.

              NotAfter -> (timestamp)
                 Date  and time after which your private CA certificate is not
                 valid.

              FailureReason -> (string)
                 Reason the request to create your private CA failed.

              CertificateAuthorityConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Your private CA configuration.

                 KeyAlgorithm -> (string)
                     Type of the public key algorithm and size,  in  bits,  of
                     the  key  pair that your CA creates when it issues a cer-
                     tificate. When you create a subordinate CA, you must  use
                     a key algorithm supported by the parent CA.

                 SigningAlgorithm -> (string)
                     Name  of  the algorithm your private CA uses to sign cer-
                     tificate requests.

                     This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAl-
                     gorithm parameter used to sign certificates when they are
                     issued.

                                      private PKI, the common name (CN) can be
                                      any string within the length limit.

                                      Note:  In publicly trusted certificates,
                                      the common name must be a  fully  quali-
                                      fied  domain name (FQDN) associated with
                                      the certificate subject.

                                      Jr. for junior, Sr. for senior, and  III
                                      for third.

                               EdiPartyName -> (structure)
                                   Represents  GeneralName  as an EdiPartyName
                                   object.

                                   Represents GeneralName as an IPv4  or  IPv6
                                   address.

                               RegisteredId -> (string)
                                   Represents GeneralName as an object identi-
                                   fier (OID).

              RevocationConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Information about  the  Online  Certificate  Status  Protocol
                 (OCSP)  configuration  or  certificate  revocation list (CRL)
                 created and maintained by your private CA.

                 CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration of the certificate revocation  list  (CRL),
                     if any, maintained by your private CA. A CRL is typically
                     updated approximately 30 minutes after a  certificate  is
                     revoked.  If  for any reason a CRL update fails, ACM Pri-
                     vate CA makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Boolean value that specifies whether certificate revo-
                        cation  lists  (CRLs)  are  enabled.  You can use this
                        value to enable certificate revocation for  a  new  CA
                        when you call the CreateCertificateAuthority action or
                        for   an   existing   CA    when    you    call    the
                        UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

                     ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                        Validity period of the CRL in days.

                     CustomCname -> (string)
                        Name  inserted  into  the certificate CRL Distribution
                        Points extension that enables the use of an alias  for
                        the  CRL  distribution  point.  Use  this value if you
                        don't want the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

                     S3BucketName -> (string)
                        Name of the S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do
                        not  provide a value for the CustomCname argument, the
                        name of your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL  Distri-
                        bution Points extension of the issued certificate. You
                        can change the name of  your  bucket  by  calling  the
                        UpdateCertificateAuthority operation. You must specify
                        a bucket policy that allows ACM Private  CA  to  write
                        the CRL to your bucket.

                     S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                        Determines  whether  the CRL will be publicly readable
                        or privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If  you
                        choose  PUBLIC_READ,  the  CRL will be accessible over
                        the     public     internet.     If     you     choose
                        BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL,  only  the owner of the CRL
                        S3 bucket can access the CRL, and your PKI clients may
                        need an alternative method of access.

                        If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                            Note:  This  default can cause CA creation to fail
                            in some circumstances. If you  have  have  enabled
                            the  Block  Public Access (BPA) feature in your S3
                            account, then you must specify the value  of  this
                            parameter  as  BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL , and not
                            doing so results in an error. If you have disabled
                            BPA   in   S3,   then   you   can  specify  either
                            BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL or  PUBLIC_READ  as  the
                            value.

                        the S3 bucket .

                 OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
                     Configuration  of  Online  Certificate  Status   Protocol
                     (OCSP)  support,  if  any, maintained by your private CA.
                     When you revoke a certificate, OCSP responses may take up
                     to 60 minutes to reflect the new status.

                     Enabled -> (boolean)
                        Flag  enabling  use  of  the Online Certificate Status
                        Protocol (OCSP) for validating certificate  revocation
                        status.

                     OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                        By  default, ACM Private CA injects an AWS domain into
                        certificates being validated by the Online Certificate
                        Status  Protocol  (OCSP). A customer can alternatively
                        use this object to define a CNAME specifying a custom-
                        ized OCSP domain.

                        Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a proto-
                        col prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                        .

              RestorableUntil -> (timestamp)
                 The  period  during  which  a deleted CA can be restored. For
                 more information, see the PermanentDeletionTimeInDays parame-
                 ter of the DeleteCertificateAuthorityRequest action.

              KeyStorageSecurityStandard -> (string)
                 Defines  a  cryptographic  key management compliance standard
                 used for handling CA keys.

                 Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

                 Note:    AWS    Region    ap-northeast-3    supports     only
                 FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER.  You  must  explicitly  specify
                 this parameter and value when creating a CA in  that  Region.
                 Specifying  a different value (or no value) results in an In-
                 validArgsException with the message "A certificate  authority
                 cannot  be created in this region with the specified security
                 standard."

       NextToken -> (string)
          When the list is truncated, this value is present and should be used
          for the NextToken parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
