ISSUE-CERTIFICATE()                                        ISSUE-CERTIFICATE()



NAME
       issue-certificate -

DESCRIPTION
       Uses  your  private  certificate  authority  (CA), or one that has been
       shared with you, to issue a client certificate. This action returns the
       Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of the certificate. You can retrieve the
       certificate by calling the GetCertificate  action  and  specifying  the
       ARN.

       NOTE:
          You cannot use the ACM ListCertificateAuthorities action to retrieve
          the ARNs of the certificates that you issue by using ACM Private CA.

OPTIONS
       --api-passthrough (structure)
          Specifies X.509 certificate information to be included in the issued
          certificate. An APIPassthrough or APICSRPassthrough template variant
          must be selected, or else this parameter is ignored. For more infor-
          mation  about  using  these templates, see Understanding Certificate
          Templates .

          If conflicting or duplicate certificate information is supplied dur-
          ing  certificate issuance, ACM Private CA applies order of operation
          rules to determine what information is used.

          Extensions -> (structure)
              Specifies X.509 extension information for a certificate.

              CertificatePolicies -> (list)
                 Contains a sequence of one or more policy information  terms,
                 each  of which consists of an object identifier (OID) and op-
                 tional qualifiers. For more information, see  NIST's  defini-
                 tion of Object Identifier (OID) .

                 In an end-entity certificate, these terms indicate the policy
                 under which the certificate was issued and the  purposes  for
                 which  it may be used. In a CA certificate, these terms limit
                 the set of policies for certification paths that include this
                 certificate.

                 (structure)
                     Defines the X.509 CertificatePolicies extension.

                     CertPolicyId -> (string)
                        Specifies  the object identifier (OID) of the certifi-
                        cate policy under which the  certificate  was  issued.
                        For  more information, see NIST's definition of Object
                        Identifier (OID) .

                     PolicyQualifiers -> (list)
                        Modifies the given CertPolicyId with a qualifier.  ACM
                        Private  CA supports the certification practice state-
                        ment (CPS) qualifier.

                        (structure)

                               Defines the qualifier type. ACM Private CA sup-
                               ports  the  use of a URI for a CPS qualifier in
                               this field.

                               CpsUri -> (string)

              SubjectAlternativeNames -> (list)
                 The  subject  alternative name extension allows identities to
                 be bound to the subject of the certificate. These  identities
                 may be included in addition to or in place of the identity in
                 the subject field of the certificate.

                        Contains  information  about  the certificate subject.
                        The Subject field in the  certificate  identifies  the
                        entity  that  owns  or  controls the public key in the
                        certificate. The entity can be a user,  computer,  de-

                        distinguished name (DN). A DN is a sequence  of  rela-
                        tive  distinguished  names  (RDNs). The RDNs are sepa-
                        rated by commas in the certificate.

                            the length limit.

                            Note: In publicly trusted certificates, the common
                            name  must be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
                            associated with the certificate subject.

                        SerialNumber -> (string)

                 A  subdivision  or unit of the organization (such as sales or
                 finance) with which the certificate subject is affiliated.

              DistinguishedNameQualifier -> (string)
                 Disambiguating information for the certificate subject.

              State -> (string)

              CommonName -> (string)
                 For CA and end-entity certificates in a private PKI, the com-
                 mon name (CN) can be any string within the length limit.

                 Note:  In publicly trusted certificates, the common name must
                 be a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) associated  with  the
                 certificate subject.

              SerialNumber -> (string)
                 The certificate serial number.

              Locality -> (string)
                 The  locality  (such as a city or town) in which the certifi-
                 cate subject is located.

              Title -> (string)
                 A title such as Mr. or Ms., which is pre-pended to  the  name
                 to refer formally to the certificate subject.

              Surname -> (string)
                 Family  name.  In the US and the UK, for example, the surname
                 of an individual is ordered last. In Asian cultures the  sur-
                 name is typically ordered first.

                 GivenName , the first letter of the middle name  if  one  ex-
                 ists, and the first letter of the Surname .

              Pseudonym -> (string)
                 Typically a shortened version of a longer GivenName . For ex-
                 ample, Jonathan is often shortened to John. Elizabeth is  of-

                 guished names (RDNs), each of which  consists  of  an  object
                 identifier (OID) and a value. For more information, see NISTs
                 definition of Object Identifier (OID) .

                 NOTE:
                     Custom attributes cannot  be  used  in  combination  with
                     standard attributes.

       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) that was returned when you called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 ``

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 1070)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --csr (blob)
          The  certificate  signing request (CSR) for the certificate you want
          to issue. As an example, you can use the following  OpenSSL  command
          to create the CSR and a 2048 bit RSA private key.
              openssl  req  -new  -newkey  rsa:2048  -days  365  -keyout  pri-
              vate/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr

          If you have a configuration file, you can  then  use  the  following
          OpenSSL  command.  The usr_cert block in the configuration file con-
          tains your X509 version 3 extensions.
              openssl req -new -config  openssl_rsa.cnf  -extensions  usr_cert
              -newkey      rsa:2048      -days      365      -keyout      pri-
              vate/test_cert_priv_key.pem -out csr/test_cert_.csr

          Note: A CSR must provide either a subject name or a subject alterna-
          tive name or the request will be rejected.

       --signing-algorithm (string)
          The  name of the algorithm that will be used to sign the certificate
          to be issued.

          This parameter should not be confused with the SigningAlgorithm  pa-
          rameter used to sign a CSR in the CreateCertificateAuthority action.

          NOTE:
              The specified signing algorithm family (RSA or ECDSA) much match
              the algorithm family of the CA's secret key.

          Possible values:

          o SHA256WITHECDSA

          o SHA384WITHECDSA

          o SHA512WITHECDSA

          o SHA256WITHRSA

          o SHA384WITHRSA

          o SHA512WITHRSA

       --template-arn (string)
          Specifies a custom configuration template to use when issuing a cer-
          tificate. If this parameter is not provided, ACM Private CA defaults
          to the EndEntityCertificate/V1 template. For  CA  certificates,  you
          should  choose  the  shortest path length that meets your needs. The
          path length is indicated by the PathLen*N* portion of the ARN, where
          N is the CA depth .

          Note:  The  CA depth configured on a subordinate CA certificate must
          not exceed the limit set by its parents in the CA hierarchy.

          For a list of TemplateArn values supported by ACM  Private  CA,  see
          Understanding Certificate Templates .

       --validity (structure)
          Information  describing  the  end of the validity period of the cer-
          tificate. This parameter sets the Not After date  for  the  certifi-
          cate.

          Certificate  validity  is the period of time during which a certifi-
          cate is valid. Validity can be expressed as  an  explicit  date  and
          time  when  the  certificate expires, or as a span of time after is-
          suance, stated in days, months, or years. For more information,  see
          Validity in RFC 5280.

          This  value  is unaffected when ValidityNotBefore is also specified.
          For example, if Validity is set to 20 days in the future,  the  cer-
          tificate  will  expire  20 days from issuance time regardless of the
          ValidityNotBefore value.

          The end of the validity period configured on a certificate must  not
          exceed the limit set on its parents in the CA hierarchy.

          Value -> (long)
              A  long integer interpreted according to the value of Type , be-
              low.

          Type -> (string)
              Determines how ACM Private CA interprets the Value parameter, an
              integer.  Supported  validity  types include those listed below.
              Type definitions with values include a sample  input  value  and
              the resulting output.
                 END_DATE  :  The  specific date and time when the certificate
                 will expire, expressed using UTCTime (YYMMDDHHMMSS) or Gener-
                 alizedTime  (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) format. When UTCTime is used, if
                 the year field (YY) is greater than or equal to 50, the  year
                 is  interpreted  as  19YY. If the year field is less than 50,
                 the year is interpreted as 20YY.

              o Sample input value: 491231235959 (UTCTime format)

              o Output expiration date/time: 12/31/2049 23:59:59
                 ABSOLUTE : The specific date and time when the validity of  a
                 certificate  will start or expire, expressed in seconds since
                 the Unix Epoch.

              o Sample input value: 2524608000

              o Output expiration date/time: 01/01/2050 00:00:00
                 DAYS , MONTHS , YEARS : The relative time from the moment  of
                 issuance  until  the  certificate  will  expire, expressed in
                 days, months, or years.

              Example if DAYS , issued on 10/12/2020 at 12:34:54 UTC:

              o Sample input value: 90

              o Output expiration date: 01/10/2020 12:34:54 UTC

              The minimum validity duration for a certificate  using  relative
              time  (DAYS ) is one day. The minimum validity for a certificate
              using absolute time (ABSOLUTE or END_DATE ) is one second.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Value=long,Type=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Value": long,
            "Type": "END_DATE"|"ABSOLUTE"|"DAYS"|"MONTHS"|"YEARS"
          }

       --validity-not-before (structure)
          Information describing the start of the validity period of the  cer-
          tificate.  This parameter sets the Not Before" date for the certifi-
          cate.

          By default, when issuing a certificate, ACM Private CA sets the "Not
          Before" date to the issuance time minus 60 minutes. This compensates
          for clock inconsistencies across computer systems. The  ValidityNot-
          Before parameter can be used to customize the Not Before value.

          Unlike  the  Validity  parameter, the ValidityNotBefore parameter is
          optional.

          The ValidityNotBefore value is expressed as  an  explicit  date  and
          time, using the Validity type value ABSOLUTE . For more information,
          see Validity in this API reference and Validity in RFC 5280.

          Value -> (long)
              A long integer interpreted according to the value of Type ,  be-

                 alizedTime (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS) format. When UTCTime is used,  if
                 the  year field (YY) is greater than or equal to 50, the year
                 is interpreted as 19YY. If the year field is  less  than  50,
                 the year is interpreted as 20YY.

              o Sample input value: 491231235959 (UTCTime format)

              o Output expiration date/time: 12/31/2049 23:59:59
                 ABSOLUTE  : The specific date and time when the validity of a
                 certificate will start or expire, expressed in seconds  since

              o Output expiration date/time: 01/01/2050 00:00:00
                 DAYS  , MONTHS , YEARS : The relative time from the moment of
                 issuance until the  certificate  will  expire,  expressed  in
                 days, months, or years.

              Example if DAYS , issued on 10/12/2020 at 12:34:54 UTC:

              o Sample input value: 90

              o Output expiration date: 01/10/2020 12:34:54 UTC

              The  minimum  validity duration for a certificate using relative
              time (DAYS ) is one day. The minimum validity for a  certificate
              using absolute time (ABSOLUTE or END_DATE ) is one second.

          }

       --idempotency-token (string)
          Alphanumeric string that can be used to distinguish between calls to
          the IssueCertificate action. Idempotency tokens for IssueCertificate
          time  out  after one minute. Therefore, if you call IssueCertificate
          multiple times with the same idempotency token  within  one  minute,
          ACM  Private CA recognizes that you are requesting only one certifi-
          cate and will issue only one. If you change  the  idempotency  token
          for  each call, PCA recognizes that you are requesting multiple cer-
          tificates.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To issue a private certificate

       The following issue-certificate command uses the private  CA  specified
       by the ARN to issue a private certificate.

          aws acm-pca issue-certificate --certificate-authority-arn arn:aws:acm-pca:us-west-2:123456789012:certificate-authority/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 --csr file://C:\cert_1.csr --signing-algorithm "SHA256WITHRSA" --validity Value=365,Type="DAYS" --idempotency-token 1234

OUTPUT
       CertificateArn -> (string)
          The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN) of the issued certificate and the
          certificate serial number. This is of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012               /certifi-
