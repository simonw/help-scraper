NAME
       describe-certificate-authority -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  information about your private certificate authority (CA) or one
       that has been shared with you. You specify the private CA on  input  by
       its  ARN (Amazon Resource Name). The output contains the status of your
       CA. This can be any of the following:

       o CREATING - ACM Private CA is creating your  private  certificate  au-
         thority.

       o PENDING_CERTIFICATE  -  The certificate is pending. You must use your
         ACM Private CA-hosted or on-premises root or subordinate CA  to  sign
         your private CA CSR and then import it into PCA.

       o ACTIVE - Your private CA is active.

       o DISABLED - Your private CA has been disabled.

       o EXPIRED - Your private CA certificate has expired.

       o FAILED  -  Your  private  CA  has failed. Your CA can fail because of
         problems such a network outage or back-end AWS failure or  other  er-
         rors.  A  failed  CA  can never return to the pending state. You must
         create a new CA.

       o DELETED - Your private CA is within  the  restoration  period,  after
         which  it is permanently deleted. The length of time remaining in the
         CA's restoration period is also included in this action's output.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-certificate-authority
          --certificate-authority-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --certificate-authority-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that was  returned  when  you  called
          CreateCertificateAuthority . This must be of the form:

              ``
              arn:aws:acm-pca:region       :account       :certificate-author-
              ity/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 `` .

              System Message: WARNING/2 (<string>:, line 70)
                     Inline literal start-string without end-string.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                                   shortened to Beth, Liz, or Eliza.

                               GenerationQualifier -> (string)
                                   Typically  a qualifier appended to the name
                                   of an individual. Examples include Jr.  for
                                   junior, Sr. for senior, and III for third.

                            EdiPartyName -> (structure)
                               Represents  GeneralName  as an EdiPartyName ob-
                               ject.

                               PartyName -> (string)
                                   Specifies the party name.

                               NameAssigner -> (string)
                                   Specifies the name assigner.

                            UniformResourceIdentifier -> (string)
                               Represents GeneralName as a URI.

                            IpAddress -> (string)
                               Represents GeneralName as an IPv4 or  IPv6  ad-
                               dress.

                            RegisteredId -> (string)
                               Represents  GeneralName as an object identifier
                               (OID).

          RevocationConfiguration -> (structure)
              Information about the Online Certificate Status Protocol  (OCSP)
              configuration  or  certificate revocation list (CRL) created and
              maintained by your private CA.

              CrlConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration of the certificate revocation  list  (CRL),  if
                 any,  maintained  by  your private CA. A CRL is typically up-
                 dated approximately 30 minutes after  a  certificate  is  re-
                 voked.  If  for any reason a CRL update fails, ACM Private CA
                 makes further attempts every 15 minutes.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Boolean value that specifies whether certificate  revoca-
                     tion  lists (CRLs) are enabled. You can use this value to
                     enable certificate revocation for a new CA when you  call
                     the  CreateCertificateAuthority action or for an existing
                     CA when you call the UpdateCertificateAuthority action.

                 ExpirationInDays -> (integer)
                     Validity period of the CRL in days.

                 CustomCname -> (string)
                     Name  inserted  into  the  certificate  CRL  Distribution
                     Points extension that enables the use of an alias for the
                     CRL distribution point. Use this value if you don't  want
                     the name of your S3 bucket to be public.

                 S3BucketName -> (string)
                     Name  of  the  S3 bucket that contains the CRL. If you do
                     not provide a value for  the  CustomCname  argument,  the
                     name  of  your S3 bucket is placed into the CRL Distribu-
                     tion Points extension of the issued certificate. You  can
                     change   the   name   of   your  bucket  by  calling  the
                     UpdateCertificateAuthority operation. You must specify  a
                     bucket policy that allows ACM Private CA to write the CRL
                     to your bucket.

                 S3ObjectAcl -> (string)
                     Determines whether the CRL will be publicly  readable  or
                     privately held in the CRL Amazon S3 bucket. If you choose
                     PUBLIC_READ, the CRL will be accessible over  the  public
                     internet.  If  you choose BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL, only
                     the owner of the CRL S3 bucket can access  the  CRL,  and
                     your  PKI  clients  may need an alternative method of ac-
                     cess.

                     If no value is specified, the default is PUBLIC_READ .
                        Note: This default can cause CA creation  to  fail  in
                        some circumstances. If you have have enabled the Block
                        Public Access (BPA) feature in your S3  account,  then
                        you  must  specify  the  value  of  this  parameter as
                        BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL , and not doing  so  results
                        in  an error. If you have disabled BPA in S3, then you
                        can specify either BUCKET_OWNER_FULL_CONTROL  or  PUB-
                        LIC_READ as the value.

                     For  more  information, see Blocking public access to the
                     S3 bucket .

              OcspConfiguration -> (structure)
                 Configuration of Online Certificate  Status  Protocol  (OCSP)
                 support,  if any, maintained by your private CA. When you re-
                 voke a certificate, OCSP responses may take up to 60  minutes
                 to reflect the new status.

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     Flag enabling use of the Online Certificate Status Proto-
                     col (OCSP) for validating certificate revocation status.

                 OcspCustomCname -> (string)
                     By default, ACM Private CA injects  an  AWS  domain  into
                     certificates  being  validated  by the Online Certificate
                     Status Protocol (OCSP). A customer can alternatively  use
                     this  object  to  define  a CNAME specifying a customized
                     OCSP domain.

                     Note: The value of the CNAME must not include a  protocol
                     prefix such as "http://" or "https://".

                     For  more information, see Customizing Online Certificate
                     Status Protocol (OCSP) in  the  AWS  Certificate  Manager
                     Private Certificate Authority (PCA) User Guide .

          RestorableUntil -> (timestamp)
              The  period  during which a deleted CA can be restored. For more
              information, see the  PermanentDeletionTimeInDays  parameter  of
              the DeleteCertificateAuthorityRequest action.

          KeyStorageSecurityStandard -> (string)
              Defines  a cryptographic key management compliance standard used
              for handling CA keys.

              Default: FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_3_OR_HIGHER

              Note:    AWS     Region     ap-northeast-3     supports     only
              FIPS_140_2_LEVEL_2_OR_HIGHER.  You  must explicitly specify this
              parameter and value when creating a CA in that Region.  Specify-
              ing a different value (or no value) results in an InvalidArgsEx-
              ception with the message "A certificate authority cannot be cre-
              ated in this region with the specified security standard."
