UPDATE-BUDGET()                                                UPDATE-BUDGET()



NAME
       update-budget -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a budget. You can change every part of a budget except for the
       budgetName and the calculatedSpend . When you modify a budget, the cal-
       culatedSpend  drops  to  zero  until  AWS has new usage data to use for
       forecasting.

       WARNING:
          Only one of BudgetLimit or PlannedBudgetLimits can be present in the
          syntax  at  one time. Use the syntax that matches your case. The Re-
          quest Syntax section shows the BudgetLimit syntax.  For  PlannedBud-
          getLimits , see the Examples section.

SYNOPSIS
            update-budget
          --account-id <value>
          --new-budget <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId  that  is associated with the budget that you want to
          update.

       --new-budget (structure)
          The budget that you want to update your budget to.

          BudgetName -> (string)
              The name of a budget. The name must be unique within an account.
              The : and \ characters aren't allowed in BudgetName .

          BudgetLimit -> (structure)
              The  total  amount  of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage,
              Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans  coverage  that  you
              want to track with your budget.
                 BudgetLimit  is  required  for cost or usage budgets, but op-
                 tional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or  coverage  bud-
                 gets.  RI  and  Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets
                 default to 100 , which is the only valid value for RI or Sav-
                 ings  Plans  utilization  or  coverage budgets. You can't use
                 BudgetLimit with PlannedBudgetLimits for CreateBudget and Up-
                 dateBudget actions.

              Amount -> (string)
                 The  cost  or  usage  amount that is associated with a budget
                 forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

              Unit -> (string)
                 The unit of measurement that is used for the budget forecast,
                 actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars or GB.

          PlannedBudgetLimits -> (map)
              A map containing multiple BudgetLimit , including current or fu-
              ture limits.
                 PlannedBudgetLimits is available for cost or usage budget and
                 supports monthly and quarterly TimeUnit .

              For  monthly  budgets,  provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits
              values. This must start from the current month and  include  the
              next  11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in epoch
              seconds.

              For quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of PlannedBudgetLimits
              value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must
              start from the current quarter and include the next 3  quarters.
              The key is the start of the quarter, UTC in epoch seconds.

              If  the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4
              quarters for quarterly, provide the  PlannedBudgetLimits  values
              only for the remaining periods.

              If  the  budget begins at a date in the future, provide Planned-
              BudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.

              After all of the BudgetLimit values in  PlannedBudgetLimits  are
              used,  the  budget  continues  to use the last limit as the Bud-
              getLimit . At that point, the planned budget provides  the  same
              experience as a fixed budget.
                 DescribeBudget   and   DescribeBudgets  response  along  with
                 PlannedBudgetLimits will also contain BudgetLimit  represent-
                 ing the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBud-
                 getLimits  .  This  only  applies  to  budgets  created  with
                 PlannedBudgetLimits  .  Budgets  created  without PlannedBud-
                 getLimits will only contain BudgetLimit , and no  PlannedBud-
                 getLimits .

                     forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of measurement that is used for the budget fore-

              If  you  create  your budget and don't specify a start date, AWS
              defaults to  the  start  of  your  chosen  time  period  (DAILY,
              MONTHLY,  QUARTERLY,  or  ANNUALLY). For example, if you created
              your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY , and didn't set  a
              start  date,  AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If
              you chose MONTHLY , AWS set your start date  to  01/01/18  00:00
              UTC  .  If you didn't specify an end date, AWS set your end date
              to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same  for  the  AWS
              Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation.

              After  the  end  date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
              notifications and subscribers.

              Start -> (timestamp)
                 The start date for a budget. If you created your  budget  and
                 didn't  specify  a  start  date, AWS defaults to the start of
                 your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or  ANNU-
                 ALLY). For example, if you created your budget on January 24,
                 2018, chose DAILY , and didn't set a start date, AWS set your
                 start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY , AWS
                 set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC . The defaults  are
                 the  same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console and
                 the API.

                 You can change your start date with the  UpdateBudget  opera-
                 tion.

              End -> (timestamp)
                 The end date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date,
                 AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC  .  The  defaults
                 are  the same for the AWS Billing and Cost Management console
                 and the API.

                 After the end date, AWS deletes the budget and all associated
                 notifications  and  subscribers. You can change your end date
                 with the UpdateBudget operation.

                     cast,  actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars
                     or GB.

              ForecastedSpend -> (structure)
                 The amount of cost, usage, RI units, or Savings  Plans  units
                 that you are forecasted to use.

                 Amount -> (string)
                     The cost or usage amount that is associated with a budget
                     forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of measurement that is used for the budget fore-
                     cast,  actual spend, or budget threshold, such as dollars
                     or GB.

              erage, Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage.

          LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
              The last time that you updated this budget.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.
