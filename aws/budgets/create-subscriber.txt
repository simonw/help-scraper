       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            create-subscriber
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          --subscriber <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget that  you  want  to
          create a subscriber for.

       --budget-name (string)
          The  name  of the budget that you want to subscribe to. Budget names
          must be unique within an account.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification that you want to create a subscriber for.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Specifies whether the notification is  for  how  much  you  have
              spent  (ACTUAL ) or for how much that you're forecasted to spend
              (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that's used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that's associated with a notification.  Thresholds
              are  always  a  percentage,  and many customers find value being
              alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount.  The  maximum
              limit  for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The type of threshold for  a  notification.  For  ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go over or
              are forecasted to go over your total cost  threshold.  For  PER-
              CENTAGE thresholds, Amazon Web Services notifies you when you go
              over or are forecasted to go over a certain percentage  of  your
              forecasted spend. For example, if you have a budget for 200 dol-
              lars and you have a PERCENTAGE threshold of 80%, Amazon Web Ser-
              vices notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Specifies whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget no-
              tification is in the ALARM state, you passed the  set  threshold
              for the budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --subscriber (structure)
          The  subscriber  that  you want to associate with a budget notifica-
          tion.

          SubscriptionType -> (string)
              The type of notification that Amazon Web  Services  sends  to  a
              subscriber.

          Address -> (string)
              The  address that Amazon Web Services sends budget notifications
              to, either an SNS topic or an email.

              When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't contain
              line breaks.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          SubscriptionType=string,Address=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "SubscriptionType": "SNS"|"EMAIL",
            "Address": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
