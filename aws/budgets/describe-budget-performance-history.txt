NAME
       describe-budget-performance-history -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the history for DAILY , MONTHLY , and QUARTERLY budgets. Bud-
       get history isn't available for ANNUAL budgets.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       describe-budget-performance-history is a paginated operation.  Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response, the --query argument must extract data from  the  results  of
       the following query expressions: BudgetPerformanceHistory

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The account ID of the user. It's a 12-digit number.

       --budget-name (string)
          A string that represents the budget name. The ":" and "" characters,
          and the "/action/" substring, aren't allowed.

       --time-period (structure)
          Retrieves how often the budget went into  an  ALARM  state  for  the
          specified time period.

          Start -> (timestamp)
              The  start  date  for  a  budget. If you created your budget and
              didn't specify a start date, Amazon Web Services defaults to the
              start  of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or
              ANNUALLY). For example, if you created your  budget  on  January
              24,  2018, chose DAILY , and didn't set a start date, Amazon Web
              Services set your start date to 01/24/18  00:00  UTC  .  If  you
              chose  MONTHLY  ,  Amazon  Web  Services  set your start date to
              01/01/18 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same for  the  Billing
              and Cost Management console and the API.

              You can change your start date with the UpdateBudget operation.

          End -> (timestamp)
              The  end  date  for a budget. If you didn't specify an end date,
              Amazon Web Services set your end date to 06/15/87  00:00  UTC  .
              The  defaults  are  the same for the Billing and Cost Management
              console and the API.

              After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the  budget  and
              all the associated notifications and subscribers. You can change
              your end date with the UpdateBudget operation.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Start=timestamp,End=timestamp

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Start": timestamp,
            "End": timestamp
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

                     Start -> (timestamp)

                        get and didn't specify a start date, Amazon  Web  Ser-

                        (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example,
                        if  you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose
                        DAILY , and didn't set a start date, Amazon  Web  Ser-
                        vices  set  your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If
                        you chose MONTHLY , Amazon Web Services set your start
                        date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same
                        for the Billing and Cost Management  console  and  the
                        API.

                        You  can  change your start date with the UpdateBudget
                        operation.

                     End -> (timestamp)
                        The end date for a budget. If you  didn't  specify  an
                        end  date,  Amazon  Web  Services set your end date to
                        06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same for the
                        Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                        After  the  end  date, Amazon Web Services deletes the
                        budget and all the associated notifications  and  sub-
                        scribers.  You  can  change your end date with the Up-
                        dateBudget operation.

       NextToken -> (string)
          A generic string.
