NAME
       describe-subscribers-for-notification -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the subscribers that are associated with a notification.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-subscribers-for-notification  is a paginated operation. Multi-
       ple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of
       results.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate ar-
       gument.  When using --output text and the --query argument on  a  pagi-
       nated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results
       of the following query expressions: Subscribers

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subscribers-for-notification
          --account-id <value>
          --budget-name <value>
          --notification <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The accountId that is associated with the budget  whose  subscribers
          you want descriptions of.

       --budget-name (string)
          The name of the budget whose subscribers you want descriptions of.

       --notification (structure)
          The notification whose subscribers you want to list.

          NotificationType -> (string)
              Whether  the notification is for how much you have spent (ACTUAL
              ) or for how much you're forecasted to spend (FORECASTED ).

          ComparisonOperator -> (string)
              The comparison that is used for this notification.

          Threshold -> (double)
              The threshold that is associated with a notification. Thresholds
              are  always  a  percentage,  and many customers find value being
              alerted between 50% - 200% of the budgeted amount.  The  maximum
              limit  for  your  threshold  is  1,000,000%  above  the budgeted
              amount.

          ThresholdType -> (string)
              The type of threshold for  a  notification.  For  ABSOLUTE_VALUE
              thresholds,  AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted
              to go over your total cost threshold. For PERCENTAGE thresholds,
              AWS notifies you when you go over or are forecasted to go over a
              certain percentage of your forecasted spend. For example, if you
              have  a budget for 200 dollars and you have a PERCENTAGE thresh-
              old of 80%, AWS notifies you when you go over 160 dollars.

          NotificationState -> (string)
              Whether this notification is in alarm. If a budget  notification
              is in the ALARM state, you have passed the set threshold for the
              budget.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          NotificationType=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Threshold=double,ThresholdType=string,NotificationState=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "NotificationType": "ACTUAL"|"FORECASTED",
            "ComparisonOperator": "GREATER_THAN"|"LESS_THAN"|"EQUAL_TO",
            "Threshold": double,
            "ThresholdType": "PERCENTAGE"|"ABSOLUTE_VALUE",
            "NotificationState": "OK"|"ALARM"
          }

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve the subscribers for a budget notification

       This example retrieves the subscribers for a Cost and Usage budget  no-
       tification.

       Command:

          aws budgets describe-subscribers-for-notification --account-id 111122223333 --budget-name "Example Budget" --notification NotificationType=ACTUAL,ComparisonOperator=GREATER_THAN,Threshold=80,ThresholdType=PERCENTAGE --max-results 5

       Output:

          {
             "Subscribers": [
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example2@example.com"
                 },
                 {
                     "SubscriptionType": "EMAIL",
                     "Address": "example@example.com"
                 }
             ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Subscribers -> (list)
          A list of subscribers that are associated with a notification.

          (structure)
              The subscriber to a budget notification. The subscriber consists
              of a subscription type and either an  Amazon  SNS  topic  or  an
              email address.

              For example, an email subscriber would have the following param-
              eters:

              o A subscriptionType of EMAIL

              o An address of example@example.com

              SubscriptionType -> (string)
                 The type of notification that AWS sends to a subscriber.

              Address -> (string)
                 The address that AWS sends budget notifications to, either an
                 SNS topic or an email.

                 When you create a subscriber, the value of Address can't con-
                 tain line breaks.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next
          set of results that you can retrieve.
