NAME
       describe-budgets -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the budgets that are associated with an account.

       WARNING:
          The  Request  Syntax  section  shows  the  BudgetLimit  syntax.  For
          PlannedBudgetLimits , see the Examples section.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-budgets is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may  be
       issued  in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Budgets

SYNOPSIS
            describe-budgets
          --account-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --account-id (string)
          The  accountId that is associated with the budgets that you want de-
          scriptions of.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Budgets -> (list)
          A list of budgets.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of the CreateBudget operation. The content
              consists of the detailed metadata and data file information, and
              the current status of the budget object.

              This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) pattern for a budget:
                 arn:aws:budgets::AccountId:budget/budgetName

              BudgetName -> (string)
                 The name of a budget. The name must be unique within  an  ac-
                 count. The : and \ characters aren't allowed in BudgetName .

              BudgetLimit -> (structure)
                 The total amount of cost, usage, RI utilization, RI coverage,
                 Savings Plans utilization, or Savings Plans coverage that you
                 want to track with your budget.
                     BudgetLimit  is  required  for cost or usage budgets, but
                     optional for RI or Savings Plans utilization or  coverage
                     budgets.  RI  and  Savings  Plans utilization or coverage
                     budgets default to 100 . This is the only valid value for
                     RI  or Savings Plans utilization or coverage budgets. You
                     can't use BudgetLimit with PlannedBudgetLimits  for  Cre-
                     ateBudget and UpdateBudget actions.

                 Amount -> (string)
                     The  cost or usage amount that's associated with a budget
                     forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                 Unit -> (string)
                     The unit of measurement that's used for the budget  fore-
                     cast,  actual  spend, or budget threshold, such as USD or
                     GBP.

              PlannedBudgetLimits -> (map)
                 A map containing multiple BudgetLimit , including current  or
                 future limits.
                     PlannedBudgetLimits is available for cost or usage budget
                     and supports both monthly and quarterly TimeUnit .

                 For monthly budgets, provide 12 months of PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values.  This  must  start from the current month and include
                 the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in
                 epoch seconds.

                 For  quarterly  budgets, provide four quarters of PlannedBud-
                 getLimits value entries in standard calendar  quarter  incre-
                 ments.  This  must start from the current quarter and include
                 the next three quarters. The key is the start of the quarter,
                 UTC in epoch seconds.

                 If the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or
                 four quarters for quarterly, provide the  PlannedBudgetLimits
                 values only for the remaining periods.

                 If  the  budget  begins  at  a  date  in  the future, provide
                 PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.

                 After all of the BudgetLimit  values  in  PlannedBudgetLimits
                 are  used,  the budget continues to use the last limit as the
                 BudgetLimit . At that point, the planned budget provides  the
                 same experience as a fixed budget.
                     DescribeBudget  and  DescribeBudgets  response along with
                     PlannedBudgetLimits also contain BudgetLimit representing
                     the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBud-
                     getLimits . This only applies to budgets that are created
                     with PlannedBudgetLimits . Budgets that are created with-
                     out PlannedBudgetLimits only contain BudgetLimit  .  They
                     don't contain PlannedBudgetLimits .

                 key -> (string)
                     A generic string.

                 value -> (structure)
                     The amount of cost or usage that's measured for a budget.

                     For example, a Spend for 3 GB of S3 usage has the follow-
                     ing parameters:

                     o An Amount of 3

                     o A unit of GB

                     Amount -> (string)
                        The cost or usage amount that's associated with a bud-
                        get forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit  of  measurement  that's used for the budget
                        forecast, actual spend, or budget threshold,  such  as
                        USD or GBP.

              CostFilters -> (map)
                 The cost filters, such as Region , Service , member account ,
                 Tag , or Cost Category , that are applied to a budget.

                 Amazon Web Services Budgets supports the  following  services
                 as a Service filter for RI budgets:

                 o Amazon EC2

                 o Amazon Redshift

                 o Amazon Relational Database Service

                 o Amazon ElastiCache

                 o Amazon OpenSearch Service

                 key -> (string)
                     A generic string.

                 value -> (list)

              TimePeriod -> (structure)
                 The  period  of  time  that's covered by a budget. You setthe
                 start date and end date. The start date must come before  the
                 end date. The end date must come before 06/15/87 00:00 UTC .

                 If  you  create  your  budget and don't specify a start date,
                 Amazon Web Services defaults to the start of your chosen time
                 period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY). For example,
                 if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY ,
                 and  didn't  set  a  start date, Amazon Web Services set your
                 start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If  you  chose  MONTHLY  ,
                 Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC
                 . If you didn't specify an end date, Amazon Web Services  set
                 your  end  date  to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC . The defaults are the
                 same for the Billing and Cost Management console and the API.

                 You can change either date with the UpdateBudget operation.

                 After the end date, Amazon Web Services  deletes  the  budget
                 and all the associated notifications and subscribers.

                 Start -> (timestamp)
                     The  start  date for a budget. If you created your budget
                     and didn't specify a start date, Amazon Web Services  de-
                     faults  to  the  start of your chosen time period (DAILY,
                     MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY).  For  example,  if  you
                     created  your  budget  on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY ,
                     and didn't set a start date, Amazon Web Services set your
                     start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY ,
                     Amazon Web Services set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00
                     UTC  . The defaults are the same for the Billing and Cost
                     Management console and the API.

                     You can change your start date with the UpdateBudget  op-
                     eration.

                 End -> (timestamp)
                     The  end  date for a budget. If you didn't specify an end
                     date, Amazon Web Services set your end date  to  06/15/87
                     00:00 UTC . The defaults are the same for the Billing and
                     Cost Management console and the API.

                     After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes the  bud-
                     get and all the associated notifications and subscribers.
                     You can change your end date with the UpdateBudget opera-
                     tion.

              CalculatedSpend -> (structure)
                 The  actual  and  forecasted  cost  or  usage that the budget
                 tracks.

                 ActualSpend -> (structure)
                     The amount of cost, usage, RI  units,  or  Savings  Plans
                     units that you used.

                     Amount -> (string)
                        The cost or usage amount that's associated with a bud-

              LastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)
                 The last time that you updated this budget.

              AutoAdjustData -> (structure)
                 The parameters  that  determine  the  budget  amount  for  an
                 auto-adjusting budget.

                 AutoAdjustType -> (string)
                     The  string that defines whether your budget auto-adjusts
                     based on historical or forecasted data.

                 HistoricalOptions -> (structure)
                     The parameters that define  or  describe  the  historical
                     data that your auto-adjusting budget is based on.

                     BudgetAdjustmentPeriod -> (integer)
                        The  number  of  budget  periods  included in the mov-
                        ing-average calculation that determines your  auto-ad-
                        justed budget amount. The maximum value depends on the
                        TimeUnit granularity of the budget:

                        o For the DAILY granularity, the maximum value is 60 .

                        o For the MONTHLY granularity, the maximum value is 12
                          .

                        o For  the QUARTERLY granularity, the maximum value is
                          4 .

                        o For the ANNUALLY granularity, the maximum value is 1
                          .

                     LookBackAvailablePeriods -> (integer)
                        The  integer that describes how many budget periods in
                        your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod are included in the calcu-
                        lation of your current BudgetLimit . If the first bud-
                        get period in your BudgetAdjustmentPeriod has no  cost
                        data, then that budget period isnt included in the av-
                        erage that determines your budget limit.

                        For example, if you set  BudgetAdjustmentPeriod  as  4
                        quarters,  but  your  account  had no cost data in the
                        first quarter, then only the last three  quarters  are
                        included  in  the calculation. In this scenario, Look-
                        BackAvailablePeriods returns 3 .

                        You cant set your own LookBackAvailablePeriods  .  The
                        value  is  automatically calculated from the BudgetAd-
                        justmentPeriod and your historical cost data.

                 LastAutoAdjustTime -> (timestamp)
                     The last time that your budget was auto-adjusted.

          The pagination token in the service response that indicates the next
          set of results that you can retrieve.
