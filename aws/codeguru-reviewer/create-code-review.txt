NAME
       create-code-review -

DESCRIPTION
       Use    to    create   a   code   review   with   a   `   CodeReviewType
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_CodeReviewType.html`__

       der a specified branch in an associated  repository.  PullRequest  code
       reviews are automatically triggered by a pull request.

                        a CI/CD code review by GitHub scripts  from  a  GitHub
                        repository,    then   the   repository   association's

       --client-request-token (string)
          Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer uses this value to prevent  the  accidental
          creation  of  duplicate  code  reviews if there are failures and re-
          tries.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
