DESCRIPTION

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            list-recommendations
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          --code-review-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --next-token (string)
          Pagination token.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results that are returned per call. The de-
          fault is 100.

       --code-review-arn (string)
          The   Amazon   Resource   Name   (ARN)   of   the    `    CodeReview
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_CodeReview.html`__
          object.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To list the recommendations for a completed code review

       The following list-recommendations example  lists  the  recommendations
       for a comleted code review. This code review has one recommendations.

OUTPUT
       RecommendationSummaries -> (list)
          List of recommendations for the requested code review.

          (structure)

              FilePath -> (string)
                 Name of the file on which a recommendation is provided.

              RecommendationId -> (string)
                 The  recommendation ID that can be used to track the provided
                 recommendations. Later on it can be used to collect the feed-
                 back.

              StartLine -> (integer)
                 Start line from where the recommendation is applicable in the

              EndLine -> (integer)
                 Last line where  the  recommendation  is  applicable  in  the
                 source commit or source branch. For a single line comment the

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the recommendation generated by CodeGuru Re-
                 viewer  for  the lines of code between the start line and the

                 Reviewer uses rules to analyze code. A rule's  recommendation
