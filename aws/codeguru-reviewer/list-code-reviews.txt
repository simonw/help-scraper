SYNOPSIS
            list-code-reviews
          [--provider-types <value>]
          [--states <value>]
          [--repository-names <value>]
          --type <value>
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --provider-types (list)
          List of provider types for filtering that needs to be applied before
          displaying  the  result.  For  example, providerTypes=[GitHub] lists
          code reviews from GitHub.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CodeCommit
            GitHub
            Bitbucket
            GitHubEnterpriseServer
            S3Bucket

       --states (list)
          List of states for filtering that needs to be  applied  before  dis-
          playing the result. For example, states=[Pending] lists code reviews
          in the Pending state.

          The valid code review states are:

          o Completed : The code review is complete.

          o Pending : The code review started and has not completed or failed.

          o Failed : The code review failed.

          o Deleting : The code review is being deleted.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            Completed
            Pending
            Failed
            Deleting

       --repository-names (list)
          List of repository names for filtering that needs to be applied  be-
          fore displaying the result.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --type (string)
          The type of code reviews to list in the response.

          Possible values:

          o PullRequest

          o RepositoryAnalysis

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of results that are returned per call. The de-
          fault is 100.

       --next-token (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list code reviews created in your AWS account in the last 90 days.

       The following list-code-reviews example lists the code reviews  created
       in the last 90 days using pull requests.

              CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)

              LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
                 The  time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when the code re-
                 view was last updated.

                 MeteredLinesOfCodeCount -> (long)
                     Lines of code metered in the code review. For the initial
                     code  review  pull  request and all subsequent revisions,
                     this includes all lines of code in the files added to the
                     pull request. In subsequent revisions, for files that al-
                     ready existed in the pull request, this includes only the
                     changed  lines  of code. In both cases, this does not in-
                     clude non-code lines such as comments and  import  state-
                     ments. For example, if you submit a pull request contain-
                     ing 5 files, each with 500 lines of code, and in a subse-
                     quent  revision  you  added  a new file with 200 lines of
                     code, and also modified a total of 25  lines  across  the
                     initial  5  files,  MeteredLinesOfCodeCount  includes the
                     first 5 files (5 * 500 = 2,500 lines), the new file  (200
                     lines)  and  the  25 changed lines of code for a total of
                     2,725 lines of code.

                 FindingsCount -> (long)
