DISASSOCIATE-REPOSITORY()                            DISASSOCIATE-REPOSITORY()



NAME
       disassociate-repository -

DESCRIPTION
       Removes  the association between Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer and a reposi-
       tory.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            disassociate-repository
          --association-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --association-arn (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  `  RepositoryAssociation
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html`__
          object. You can retrieve this ARN by calling ` ListRepositoryAssoci-
          ations
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_ListRepositoryAssociations.html`__
          .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To disassociate a repository association

       The following disassociate-repository disassociates a repository  asso-
       ciation that is using an AWS CodeCommit repository.

          aws codeguru-reviewer disassociate-repository \
              --association-arn arn:aws:codeguru-reviewer:us-west-2:123456789012:association:a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111

       Output:

          {
              "RepositoryAssociation": {
                  "AssociationId": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",

          Information about the disassociated repository.

          AssociationId -> (string)

              The  Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  an  Amazon  Web Services
              CodeStar    Connections    connection.     Its     format     is
              arn:aws:codestar-connections:region-id:aws-account_id:connec-
              tion/connection-id . For  more  information,  see  `  Connection

              in the Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections API Reference .

          Name -> (string)
              The name of the repository.

          Owner -> (string)
              The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCom-
              mit  repository,  this  is the Amazon Web Services account ID of
              the account that owns the repository. For a GitHub,  GitHub  En-
              terprise  Server,  or Bitbucket repository, this is the username
              for the account that owns the repository. For an S3  repository,
              it can be the username or Amazon Web Services account ID.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The provider type of the repository association.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the repository association.

              The valid repository association states are:

              o Associated : The repository association is complete.

              o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

                o Setting  up pull request notifications. This is required for
                  pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

                NOTE:
                   If your repository ProviderType is GitHub ,  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise  Server  ,  or  Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer creates
                   webhooks in your repository to  trigger  CodeGuru  Reviewer
                   reviews.  If  you delete these webhooks, reviews of code in
                   your repository cannot be triggered.

                o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru
                  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

              o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

              o Disassociating  :  CodeGuru  Reviewer  is removing the reposi-
                tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

              o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer  successfully  disassociated
                the  repository.  You  can  create a new association with this
                repository if you want to review source code in it later.  You
                can  control  access  to code reviews created in an associated
                repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more
                information,  see  Using  tags to control access to associated
                repositories in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          StateReason -> (string)
              A description of why the repository association is in  the  cur-
              rent state.

          LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the repository
              association was last updated.

          CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  repository
              association was created.

                either owned by Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                (KMS)  (AWS_OWNED_CMK  )  or  customer  managed (CUSTOMER_MAN-
                AGED_CMK ).

              o The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that  is  associated
                with this respository association.

              KMSKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is associated
                 with a respository association.

              CodeArtifacts -> (structure)
                 A CodeArtifacts object. The CodeArtifacts object includes the

                     code review with security analysis. For more information,
                     see  Create  code  reviews  with security analysis in the

       Tags -> (map)
          An array of key-value pairs used to tag an associated repository.  A
          tag is a custom attribute label with two parts:

          o A  tag  key  (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project , or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,  111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case  sen-
            sitive.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
