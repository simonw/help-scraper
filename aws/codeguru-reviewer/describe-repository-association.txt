OPTIONS
       --association-arn (string)
          The Amazon  Resource  Name  (ARN)  of  the  `  RepositoryAssociation
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_RepositoryAssociation.html`__
          object. You can retrieve this ARN by calling ` ListRepositoryAssoci-
          ations
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codeguru/latest/reviewer-api/API_ListRepositoryAssociations.html`__
          .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              The name of the repository.

          Owner -> (string)
              The owner of the repository. For an Amazon Web Services CodeCom-
              mit  repository,  this  is the Amazon Web Services account ID of
              the account that owns the repository. For a GitHub,  GitHub  En-
              terprise  Server,  or Bitbucket repository, this is the username
              for the account that owns the repository. For an S3  repository,
              it can be the username or Amazon Web Services account ID.

          ProviderType -> (string)
              The provider type of the repository association.

          State -> (string)
              The state of the repository association.

              The valid repository association states are:

              o Associated : The repository association is complete.

              o Associating : CodeGuru Reviewer is:

                o Setting  up pull request notifications. This is required for
                  pull requests to trigger a CodeGuru Reviewer review.

                NOTE:
                   If your repository ProviderType is GitHub ,  GitHub  Enter-
                   prise  Server  ,  or  Bitbucket , CodeGuru Reviewer creates
                   webhooks in your repository to  trigger  CodeGuru  Reviewer
                   reviews.  If  you delete these webhooks, reviews of code in
                   your repository cannot be triggered.

                o Setting up source code access. This is required for CodeGuru
                  Reviewer to securely clone code in your repository.

              o Failed : The repository failed to associate or disassociate.

              o Disassociating  :  CodeGuru  Reviewer  is removing the reposi-
                tory's pull request notifications and source code access.

              o Disassociated : CodeGuru Reviewer  successfully  disassociated
                the  repository.  You  can  create a new association with this
                repository if you want to review source code in it later.  You
                can  control  access  to code reviews created in an associated
                repository with tags after it has been disassociated. For more
                information,  see  Using  tags to control access to associated
                repositories in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

          StateReason -> (string)
              A description of why the repository association is in  the  cur-
              rent state.

          LastUpdatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The  time,  in milliseconds since the epoch, when the repository
              association was last updated.

          CreatedTimeStamp -> (timestamp)
              The time, in milliseconds since the epoch, when  the  repository
              association was created.

                either owned by Amazon Web  Services  Key  Management  Service
                (KMS)  (AWS_OWNED_CMK  )  or  customer  managed (CUSTOMER_MAN-
                AGED_CMK ).

              o The ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that  is  associated
                with this respository association.

              KMSKeyId -> (string)
                 The  ID of the Amazon Web Services KMS key that is associated
                 with a respository association.

              BucketName -> (string)
                 The name of the S3 bucket  used  for  associating  a  new  S3

              CodeArtifacts -> (structure)
                 A CodeArtifacts object. The CodeArtifacts object includes the
                 S3 object key for a source code .zip file and for a build ar-
                 tifacts .zip file that contains .jar or .class files.

                 SourceCodeArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The  S3  object  key for a source code .zip file. This is

                 BuildArtifactsObjectKey -> (string)
                     The S3 object key for a build artifacts  .zip  file  that
                     contains  .jar  or  .class  files. This is required for a
                     code review with security analysis. For more information,
                     see  Create  code  reviews  with security analysis in the
                     Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide .

       Tags -> (map)
          An array of key-value pairs used to tag an associated repository.  A
          tag is a custom attribute label with two parts:

          o A  tag  key  (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project , or
            Secret ). Tag keys are case sensitive.

          o An optional field known as a tag value (for example,  111122223333
            , Production , or a team name). Omitting the tag value is the same
            as using an empty string. Like tag keys, tag values are case  sen-
            sitive.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)
