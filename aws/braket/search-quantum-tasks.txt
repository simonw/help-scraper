SEARCH-QUANTUM-TASKS()                                  SEARCH-QUANTUM-TASKS()



NAME
       search-quantum-tasks -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for tasks that match the specified filter values.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-quantum-tasks  is  a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: quantumTasks

SYNOPSIS
            search-quantum-tasks
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          Array of SearchQuantumTasksFilter objects.

          (structure)
              A filter to use to search for tasks.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the device used for the task.

              operator -> (string)
                 An operator to use in the filter.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use for the filter.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,operator=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "operator": "LT"|"LTE"|"EQUAL"|"GT"|"GTE"|"BETWEEN",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       nextToken -> (string)
          A token used for pagination of results, or null if there are no  ad-
          ditional  results.  Use  the  token value in a subsequent request to
          continue results where the previous request ended.

       quantumTasks -> (list)
          An array of QuantumTaskSummary objects  for  tasks  that  match  the
          specified filters.

          (structure)
              Includes information about a quantum task.

              createdAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the task was created.

              deviceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the device the task ran on.

              endedAt -> (timestamp)
                 The time at which the task finished.

              outputS3Bucket -> (string)
                 The S3 bucket where the task result file is stored..

              outputS3Directory -> (string)
                 The  folder  in  the  S3 bucket where the task result file is
                 stored.

              quantumTaskArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the task.

              shots -> (long)
                 The shots used for the task.

              status -> (string)
                 The status of the task.

              tags -> (map)
                 Displays the key, value pairs of tags  associated  with  this
                 quantum task.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)
