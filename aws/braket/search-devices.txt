SEARCH-DEVICES()                                              SEARCH-DEVICES()



NAME
       search-devices -

DESCRIPTION
       Searches for devices using the specified filters.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       search-devices  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: devices

SYNOPSIS
            search-devices
          --filters <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (list)
          The filter values to use to search for a device.

          (structure)
              The filter to use for searching devices.

              name -> (string)
                 The name to use to filter results.

              values -> (list)
                 The values to use to filter results.

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          name=string,values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "name": "string",
              "values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       devices -> (list)
          An array of DeviceSummary objects for devices that match the  speci-
          fied filter values.

          (structure)
              Includes information about the device.

              deviceArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the device.

              deviceName -> (string)
                 The name of the device.

              deviceStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the device.

              deviceType -> (string)
                 The type of the device.

              providerName -> (string)
                 The provider of the device.

       nextToken -> (string)
          A  token used for pagination of results, or null if there are no ad-
          ditional results. Use the token value in  a  subsequent  request  to
          continue results where the previous request ended.
