PUBLISH-VERSION()                                            PUBLISH-VERSION()



NAME
       publish-version -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  version  from the current code and configuration of a func-
       tion. Use versions to create a snapshot of your function code and  con-
       figuration that doesn't change.

       Lambda  doesn't  publish  a version if the function's configuration and
       code haven't changed since the last version. Use  UpdateFunctionCode or
       UpdateFunctionConfiguration  to update the function before publishing a
       version.

       Clients can invoke versions directly or with an  alias.  To  create  an
       alias, use  CreateAlias .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            publish-version
          --function-name <value>
          [--code-sha256 <value>]
          [--description <value>]
          [--revision-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name - MyFunction .

          o Function  ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:My-
            Function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:MyFunction .

          The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If  you  specify
          only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --code-sha256 (string)
          Only  publish  a  version if the hash value matches the value that's
          specified. Use this option to avoid  publishing  a  version  if  the
          function code has changed since you last updated it. You can get the
          hash for the version that you uploaded from the output  of   Update-
          FunctionCode .

       --description (string)
          A  description  for  the  version to override the description in the
          function configuration.

       --revision-id (string)
          Only update the function if the revision ID matches  the  ID  that's
          specified.  Use  this  option  to  avoid publishing a version if the
          function configuration has changed since you last updated it.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       The  following  publish-version  example publishes a new version of the
       my-function Lambda function.
