NAME
       update-function-configuration -

DESCRIPTION
       Modify the version-specific settings of a Lambda function.

       When  you update a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the func-
       tion and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a  VPC,
       this  process can take a minute. During this time, you can't modify the
       function, but you can still invoke it. The LastUpdateStatus  ,  LastUp-
       dateStatusReason  ,  and  LastUpdateStatusReasonCode  fields in the re-
       sponse from  GetFunctionConfiguration indicate when the update is  com-
       plete and the function is processing events with the new configuration.
       For more information, see Lambda function states .

       These settings can vary between versions of a function and  are  locked
       when  you  publish  a  version. You can't modify the configuration of a
       published version, only the unpublished version.

       To configure function concurrency,  use   PutFunctionConcurrency  .  To
       grant  invoke  permissions  to an Amazon Web Services account or Amazon
       Web Service, use  AddPermission .

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name  my-function .

          o Function     ARN       arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN  123456789012:function:my-function .

          The  length  constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify
          only the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --role (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the function's execution role.

       --handler (string)
          The name of the method within your code that  Lambda  calls  to  run
          your  function.  Handler  is required if the deployment package is a
          .zip file archive. The format includes the file name.  It  can  also
          include  namespaces  and other qualifiers, depending on the runtime.
          For more information, see Lambda programming model .

       --description (string)
          A description of the function.

       --timeout (integer)
          The amount of time (in seconds) that Lambda allows a function to run
          before  stopping  it.  The default is 3 seconds. The maximum allowed
          value is 900 seconds. For more information, see Lambda execution en-
          vironment .

       --memory-size (integer)
          The  amount of memory available to the function at runtime. Increas-
          ing the function memory also increases its CPU allocation.  The  de-
          fault value is 128 MB. The value can be any multiple of 1 MB.

       --vpc-config (structure)
          For  network connectivity to Amazon Web Services resources in a VPC,
          specify a list of security groups and subnets in the VPC.  When  you
          connect  a function to a VPC, it can access resources and the inter-
          net only through that VPC. For more information, see  Configuring  a
          Lambda function to access resources in a VPC .

       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
