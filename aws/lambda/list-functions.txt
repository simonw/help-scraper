LIST-FUNCTIONS()                                              LIST-FUNCTIONS()



NAME
       list-functions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of Lambda functions, with the version-specific configu-
       ration of each. Lambda returns up to 50 functions per call.

       Set FunctionVersion to ALL to include all published  versions  of  each
       function in addition to the unpublished version.

       NOTE:
          The ListFunctions action returns a subset of the  FunctionConfigura-
          tion fields. To get the additional fields  (State,  StateReasonCode,
          StateReason,  LastUpdateStatus, LastUpdateStatusReason, LastUpdateS-
          tatusReasonCode) for a function or version, use  GetFunction .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-functions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be  is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Functions

SYNOPSIS
            list-functions
          [--master-region <value>]
          [--function-version <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --master-region (string)
          For  Lambda@Edge  functions,  the  Amazon Web Services Region of the
          master function. For example, us-east-1 filters the  list  of  func-
          tions to only include Lambda@Edge functions replicated from a master
          function in US East (N. Virginia). If specified, you must set  Func-
          tionVersion to ALL .

       --function-version (string)
          Set  to  ALL  to  include entries for all published versions of each
          function.

          Possible values:

          o ALL

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
