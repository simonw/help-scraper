DELETE-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPING()                    DELETE-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPING()



NAME
       delete-event-source-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  an event source mapping . You can get the identifier of a map-
       ping from the output of  ListEventSourceMappings .

       When you delete an event source mapping, it enters a Deleting state and
       might not be completely deleted for several seconds.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-event-source-mapping
          --uuid <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --uuid (string)
          The identifier of the event source mapping.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To delete the mapping between an event source and an AWS  Lambda  func-
       tion

       The  following  delete-event-source-mapping example deletes the mapping
       between an SQS queue and the my-function Lambda function.

          aws lambda delete-event-source-mapping \
              --uuid  a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE

       Output:

          {
              "UUID": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
              "StateTransitionReason": "USER_INITIATED",
              "LastModified": 1569285870.271,
              "BatchSize": 5,
              "State": "Deleting",
              "FunctionArn": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function",
              "EventSourceArn": "arn:aws:sqs:us-west-2:123456789012:mySQSqueue"
          }

OUTPUT
       UUID -> (string)
          The identifier of the event source mapping.

       StartingPosition -> (string)
          The  position  in a stream from which to start reading. Required for
          Amazon Kinesis, Amazon DynamoDB,  and  Amazon  MSK  stream  sources.
          AT_TIMESTAMP is supported only for Amazon Kinesis streams.

       StartingPositionTimestamp -> (timestamp)
          With  StartingPosition  set to AT_TIMESTAMP , the time from which to
          start reading.

       BatchSize -> (integer)
          The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda  pulls  from
          your  stream  or queue and sends to your function. Lambda passes all
          of the records in the batch to the function in a single call, up  to
          the payload limit for synchronous invocation (6 MB).

          Default value: Varies by service. For Amazon SQS, the default is 10.
          For all other services, the default is 100.

          Related setting: When you set BatchSize to a value greater than  10,
          you must set MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to at least 1.

       MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds -> (integer)
          (Streams and Amazon SQS standard queues) The maximum amount of time,
          in seconds, that Lambda spends gathering records before invoking the
          function.

          Default: 0

          Related  setting: When you set BatchSize to a value greater than 10,
          you must set MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds to at least 1.

       ParallelizationFactor -> (integer)
          (Streams only) The number of batches to  process  concurrently  from
          each shard. The default value is 1.

                 Pattern -> (string)
                     A filter pattern. For more information on the syntax of a

       MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
          (Streams only) Discard records older than the specified age. The de-
          fault  value is -1, which sets the maximum age to infinite. When the
