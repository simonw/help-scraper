LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()                      LIST-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPINGS()



NAME
       list-event-source-mappings -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  event  source  mappings.  Specify an EventSourceArn to only show
       event source mappings for a single event source.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-event-source-mappings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: EventSourceMappings

SYNOPSIS
            list-event-source-mappings
          [--event-source-arn <value>]
          [--function-name <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --event-source-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event source.

          o Amazon Kinesis - The ARN of the data stream or a stream consumer.

          o Amazon DynamoDB Streams - The ARN of the stream.

          o Amazon Simple Queue Service - The ARN of the queue.

          o Amazon  Managed  Streaming for Apache Kafka - The ARN of the clus-
            ter.

       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function.
              Name formats

          o Function name - MyFunction .

          o Function ARN -  arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:My-
            Function .

          o Version or Alias ARN - arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:MyFunction:PROD .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:MyFunction .

          The length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If  you  specify
          only the function name, it's limited to 64 characters in length.

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

       The following list-event-source-mappings example displays a list of the
       event source mappings for the my-function Lambda function.

          aws lambda list-event-source-mappings \
              --function-name my-function

       Output:

          {

                  {
                      "UUID": "a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-11111EXAMPLE",
                      "StateTransitionReason": "USER_INITIATED",
                      "LastModified": 1569284520.333,
                      "BatchSize": 5,
                      "State": "Enabled",

          (structure)

                 quired  for  Amazon  Kinesis, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon MSK
                 stream sources. AT_TIMESTAMP is supported only for Amazon Ki-
                 nesis streams.

                 The maximum number of records in each batch that Lambda pulls
                 from  your stream or queue and sends to your function. Lambda
                 passes all of the records in the batch to the function  in  a
                 single  call, up to the payload limit for synchronous invoca-
                 tion (6 MB).

                 is 10. For all other services, the default is 100.

                 Related  setting:  When  you set BatchSize to a value greater
                 than 10, you must set  MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds  to  at

                 fore invoking the function.

                 Default: 0

                 Related  setting:  When  you set BatchSize to a value greater
                 than 10, you must set  MaximumBatchingWindowInSeconds  to  at

                 criteria  that  determine  whether  Lambda  should process an
                 event. For more information, see Lambda event filtering .

                        Pattern -> (string)
                            A filter pattern. For more information on the syn-
                            tax of a filter pattern, see Filter rule syntax .

                 An array of the authentication protocol, VPC  components,  or
                 virtual host to secure and define your event source.

                 (structure)
                     To secure and define access to your event source, you can
                     specify the authentication protocol, VPC  components,  or
                     virtual host.

                     Type -> (string)
                        The  type  of authentication protocol, VPC components,
                        or virtual host for your event  source.  For  example:
                        "Type":"SASL_SCRAM_512_AUTH" .

                        o BASIC_AUTH  - (Amazon MQ) The Secrets Manager secret
                          that stores your broker credentials.

                        o VPC_SECURITY_GROUP - The VPC security group used  to
                          manage access to your self-managed Apache Kafka bro-
                          kers.

                          be  specified  in  an  UpdateEventSourceMapping  API

                        (string)

              MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
                 (Streams  only) Discard records older than the specified age.
                 The default value is -1, which sets the maximum age to  infi-
                 nite.  When  the  value is set to infinite, Lambda never dis-
                 cards old records.

              BisectBatchOnFunctionError -> (boolean)
                 (Streams only) If the function returns an  error,  split  the
                 batch in two and retry. The default value is false.

                 (Streams  only) Discard records after the specified number of
                 retries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum num-
                 ber  of retries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is in-
                 finite, Lambda retries failed records until  the  record  ex-
                 pires in the event source.

              TumblingWindowInSeconds -> (integer)
                 (Streams  only)  The duration in seconds of a processing win-
                 dow. The range is 1900 seconds.

              FunctionResponseTypes -> (list)
                 (Streams only) A list of current response type enums  applied
                 to the event source mapping.
