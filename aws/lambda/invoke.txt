INVOKE()                                                              INVOKE()



NAME
       invoke -

DESCRIPTION
       Invokes a Lambda function. You can invoke a function synchronously (and
       wait for the response), or asynchronously. To invoke a  function  asyn-
       chronously, set InvocationType to Event .

       For  synchronous  invocation , details about the function response, in-
       cluding errors, are included in the response body and headers. For  ei-
       ther  invocation  type,  you can find more information in the execution
       log and trace .

       When an error occurs, your function  may  be  invoked  multiple  times.
       Retry  behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invoca-
       tion type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and  it
       returns  an  error,  Lambda executes the function up to two more times.
       For more information, see Retry Behavior .

       For asynchronous invocation , Lambda adds  events  to  a  queue  before
       sending  them  to  your function. If your function does not have enough
       capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be  lost.  Occasionally,
       your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no er-
       ror occurs. To retain events that were not  processed,  configure  your
       function with a dead-letter queue .

       The  status  code  in the API response doesn't reflect function errors.
       Error codes are reserved for errors that prevent your function from ex-
       ecuting, such as permissions errors, limit errors , or issues with your
       function's  code  and  configuration.  For  example,   Lambda   returns
       TooManyRequestsException  if  executing the function would cause you to
       exceed a concurrency limit at either the account level (ConcurrentInvo-
       cationLimitExceeded  ) or function level (ReservedFunctionConcurrentIn-
       vocationLimitExceeded ).

       For functions with a long timeout, your client  might  be  disconnected
       during  synchronous invocation while it waits for a response. Configure
       your HTTP client, SDK, firewall, proxy, or operating  system  to  allow
       for long connections with timeout or keep-alive settings.

       This  operation  requires  permission for the lambda:InvokeFunction ac-
       tion. For details on how to set up permissions for cross-account  invo-
       cations, see Granting function access to other accounts .

SYNOPSIS
            invoke
          --function-name <value>
          [--invocation-type <value>]
          [--log-type <value>]
          [--client-context <value>]
          [--payload <value>]
          [--qualifier <value>]
          <outfile>

OPTIONS
       --function-name (string)
          The name of the Lambda function, version, or alias.
              Name formats

          o Function  name  -  my-function  (name-only),  my-function:v1 (with
            alias).

          o Function   ARN    -    arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:func-
            tion:my-function .

          o Partial ARN - 123456789012:function:my-function .

          You  can append a version number or alias to any of the formats. The
          length constraint applies only to the full ARN. If you specify  only
          the function name, it is limited to 64 characters in length.

       --invocation-type (string)
          Choose from the following options.

          o RequestResponse  (default)  -  Invoke  the function synchronously.
            Keep the connection open until the function returns a response  or
            times out. The API response includes the function response and ad-
            ditional data.

          o Event - Invoke the function asynchronously. Send events that  fail
            multiple  times  to the function's dead-letter queue (if it's con-
            figured). The API response only includes a status code.

          o DryRun - Validate parameter values and verify  that  the  user  or
            role has permission to invoke the function.

          Possible values:

          o Event

          o RequestResponse

          o DryRun

       --log-type (string)
          Set to Tail to include the execution log in the response. Applies to
          synchronously invoked functions only.

          Possible values:

          o None

          o Tail

       --client-context (string)
          Up to 3583 bytes of base64-encoded data about the invoking client to
          pass to the function in the context object.

       --payload (blob)
          The JSON that you want to provide to your Lambda function as input.

          You  can  enter  the JSON directly. For example, --payload '{ "key":
          "value" }' . You can also specify a file path. For  example,  --pay-
          load file://payload.json .

       --qualifier (string)
          Specify  a  version  or  alias  to invoke a published version of the
          function.

       outfile (string) Filename where the content will be saved

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       Example 1: To invoke a Lambda function synchronously

       The  following  invoke  example  invokes  the my-function function syn-
       chronously.

          aws lambda invoke \
              --function-name my-function \
              --payload '{ "name": "Bob" }' \
              response.json

       Output:

          {
              "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST",
              "StatusCode": 200
          }

       For more information, see Synchronous Invocation in the AWS Lambda  De-
       veloper Guide.

       Example 2: To invoke a Lambda function asynchronously

       The  following  invoke  example  invokes the my-function function asyn-
       chronously.

          aws lambda invoke \
              --function-name my-function \
              --invocation-type Event \
              --payload '{ "name": "Bob" }' \
              response.json

       Output:

          {
              "StatusCode": 202
          }

       For more information, see Asynchronous Invocation in the AWS Lambda De-
       veloper Guide.

OUTPUT
       StatusCode -> (integer)
          The  HTTP  status code is in the 200 range for a successful request.
          For the RequestResponse invocation type, this status  code  is  200.
          For  the  Event  invocation  type,  this status code is 202. For the
          DryRun invocation type, the status code is 204.

       FunctionError -> (string)
          If present, indicates that an error occurred during function  execu-
          tion. Details about the error are included in the response payload.

       LogResult -> (string)
          The last 4 KB of the execution log, which is base64 encoded.

       Payload -> (blob)
          The response from the function, or an error object.

       ExecutedVersion -> (string)
          The  version  of the function that executed. When you invoke a func-
          tion with an alias, this indicates which version the alias  resolved
          to.
