GET-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()                                  GET-ACCOUNT-SETTINGS()



NAME
       get-account-settings -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  details  about  your account's limits and usage in an Amazon
       Web Services Region.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-account-settings
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve details about your account in an AWS Region

       The  following  get-account-settings example displays the Lambda limits
       and usage information for your account.

          aws lambda get-account-settings

       Output:

          {
              "AccountLimit": {
                 "CodeSizeUnzipped": 262144000,
                 "UnreservedConcurrentExecutions": 1000,
                 "ConcurrentExecutions": 1000,
                 "CodeSizeZipped": 52428800,
                 "TotalCodeSize": 80530636800
              },
              "AccountUsage": {
                 "FunctionCount": 4,
                 "TotalCodeSize": 9426
              }
          }

       Guide.

OUTPUT
       AccountLimit -> (structure)
          Limits that are related to concurrency and code storage.

          TotalCodeSize -> (long)
              The  amount of storage space that you can use for all deployment
              packages and layer archives.

          CodeSizeUnzipped -> (long)
              The maximum size of a function's deployment package  and  layers
              when they're extracted.

          CodeSizeZipped -> (long)
              The  maximum size of a deployment package when it's uploaded di-
              rectly to Lambda. Use Amazon S3 for larger files.

          ConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of simultaneous function executions.

          UnreservedConcurrentExecutions -> (integer)
              The maximum number of simultaneous  function  executions,  minus
              the capacity that's reserved for individual functions with  Put-
              FunctionConcurrency .

       AccountUsage -> (structure)
          The number of functions and amount of storage in use.

          TotalCodeSize -> (long)
              The amount of storage space, in bytes, that's being used by  de-
              ployment packages and layer archives.

          FunctionCount -> (long)
              The number of Lambda functions.
