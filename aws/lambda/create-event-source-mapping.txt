CREATE-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPING()                    CREATE-EVENT-SOURCE-MAPPING()



NAME
       create-event-source-mapping -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  mapping  between  an  event  source and an Lambda function.
       Lambda reads items from the event source and triggers the function.

       For details about how to configure different  event  sources,  see  the
       following topics.

       o Amazon DynamoDB Streams

       o Amazon Kinesis

       o Amazon SQS

       o Amazon MQ and RabbitMQ

       o Amazon MSK

       o Apache Kafka

       The  following  error  handling  options  are only available for stream
       sources (DynamoDB and Kinesis):

       o BisectBatchOnFunctionError - If the function returns an error,  split
         the batch in two and retry.

       o DestinationConfig  - Send discarded records to an Amazon SQS queue or
         Amazon SNS topic.

       o MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds - Discard records older than the  specified
         age.  The  default value is infinite (-1). When set to infinite (-1),
         failed records are retried until the record expires

       o MaximumRetryAttempts - Discard records after the specified number  of
         retries.  The  default  value  is infinite (-1). When set to infinite
         (-1), failed records are retried until the record expires.

       o ParallelizationFactor - Process multiple batches from each shard con-
         currently.

       For  information  about  which  configuration  parameters apply to each
       event source, see the following topics.

       o Amazon DynamoDB Streams

       o Amazon Kinesis

       o Amazon SQS

       o Amazon MQ and RabbitMQ

       o Amazon MSK

       o Apache Kafka

            ReportBatchItemFailures

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       The following create-event-source-mapping example creates a mapping be-
       tween an SQS queue and the my-function Lambda function.

          aws lambda create-event-source-mapping \
              --function-name my-function \

                 The  type of authentication protocol, VPC components, or vir-
                 tual   host   for   your   event   source.    For    example:
                 "Type":"SASL_SCRAM_512_AUTH" .

                 o BASIC_AUTH  -  (Amazon  MQ) The Secrets Manager secret that
                   stores your broker credentials.

                 o BASIC_AUTH - (Self-managed Apache Kafka) The  Secrets  Man-
                   ager ARN of your secret key used for SASL/PLAIN authentica-
                   tion of your Apache Kafka brokers.

                 o VPC_SUBNET - The subnets associated with your  VPC.  Lambda
                   connects to these subnets to fetch data from your self-man-
                   aged Apache Kafka cluster.

                 o VPC_SECURITY_GROUP - The VPC security group used to  manage
                   access to your self-managed Apache Kafka brokers.

                 o SASL_SCRAM_256_AUTH  -  The Secrets Manager ARN of your se-
                   cret key used for SASL  SCRAM-256  authentication  of  your
                   self-managed Apache Kafka brokers.

                 o SASL_SCRAM_512_AUTH  -  The Secrets Manager ARN of your se-
                   cret key used for SASL  SCRAM-512  authentication  of  your
                   self-managed Apache Kafka brokers.

                 o VIRTUAL_HOST  - (Amazon MQ) The name of the virtual host in
                   your RabbitMQ broker. Lambda uses this RabbitMQ host as the
                   event source. This property cannot be specified in an Upda-
                   teEventSourceMapping API call.

                 o CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_TLS_AUTH  -  (Amazon  MSK,  Self-managed
                   Apache  Kafka)  The  Secrets Manager ARN of your secret key
                   containing the certificate chain (X.509 PEM),  private  key
                   (PKCS#8  PEM), and private key password (optional) used for
                   mutual TLS authentication of your MSK/Apache Kafka brokers.

              URI -> (string)
                 The  value  for your chosen configuration in Type . For exam-
                 ple: "URI": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:01234567890:se-
                 cret:MyBrokerSecretName" .

       SelfManagedEventSource -> (structure)
          The self-managed Apache Kafka cluster for your event source.

          Endpoints -> (map)
              The list of bootstrap servers for your Kafka brokers in the fol-
              lowing            format:             "KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS":
              ["abc.xyz.com:xxxx","abc2.xyz.com:xxxx"] .

              key -> (string)

              value -> (list)
                 (string)

       MaximumRecordAgeInSeconds -> (integer)
          (Streams only) Discard records older than the specified age. The de-
          fault value is -1, which sets the maximum age to infinite. When  the
          value is set to infinite, Lambda never discards old records.

       BisectBatchOnFunctionError -> (boolean)
          (Streams  only) If the function returns an error, split the batch in
          two and retry. The default value is false.

       MaximumRetryAttempts -> (integer)
          (Streams only) Discard records after the  specified  number  of  re-
          tries. The default value is -1, which sets the maximum number of re-
          tries to infinite. When MaximumRetryAttempts is infinite, Lambda re-
          tries failed records until the record expires in the event source.

       TumblingWindowInSeconds -> (integer)
          (Streams  only)  The duration in seconds of a processing window. The
          range is 1900 seconds.

       FunctionResponseTypes -> (list)
          (Streams only) A list of current response type enums applied to  the
          event source mapping.
