CREATE-FUNCTION()                                            CREATE-FUNCTION()



NAME
       create-function -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a Lambda function. To create a function, you need a deployment
       package and an execution role . The deployment package is a  .zip  file
       archive or container image that contains your function code. The execu-
       tion role grants the function permission to use  Amazon  Web  Services,
       such  as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and X-Ray for request
       tracing.

       If the deployment package is a container image , then you set the pack-
       age  type  to Image . For a container image, the code property must in-
       clude the URI of a container image in the Amazon ECR registry.  You  do
       not need to specify the handler and runtime properties.

       If  the  deployment  package  is a .zip file archive , then you set the
       package type to Zip . For a .zip file archive, the code property speci-
       fies  the  location of the .zip file. You must also specify the handler
       and runtime properties. The code in the deployment package must be com-
       patible  with  the  target instruction set architecture of the function
       (x86-64 or arm64 ). If you do not specify the  architecture,  then  the
       default value is x86-64 .

       When  you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the func-
       tion and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a  VPC,
       this  process  can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't in-
       voke or modify the function. The State , StateReason , and StateReason-
       Code  fields  in  the  response from  GetFunctionConfiguration indicate
       when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see  Lambda
       function states .

       A  function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions
       and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your func-
       tion's  code  and  configuration.  A published version is a snapshot of
       your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is
       a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a
       different version. Use the Publish parameter to  create  version  1  of
       your function from its initial configuration.

       The  other  parameters  let  you  configure  version-specific and func-
       tion-level settings. You can  modify  version-specific  settings  later
       with   UpdateFunctionConfiguration  .  Function-level settings apply to
       both the unpublished and published versions of the  function,  and  in-
       clude  tags  ( TagResource ) and per-function concurrency limits ( Put-
       FunctionConcurrency ).

       You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file  ar-
       chive.  To  enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a
       code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code pack-
       age  with  UpdateFunctionCode , Lambda checks that the code package has
       a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configura-
       tion  includes  set  of signing profiles, which define the trusted pub-
       lishers for this function.

       If another Amazon Web Services account or an Amazon Web Service invokes
       your function, use  AddPermission to grant permission by creating a re-
       source-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy. You can grant
       permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.

       To invoke your function directly, use  Invoke . To invoke your function
       in response to events in other Amazon Web  Services,  create  an  event
       source  mapping  (  CreateEventSourceMapping ), or configure a function
       trigger in the other service. For more information, see Invoking Lambda
       functions .

       --kms-key-arn (string)
          The ARN of the Key Management Service  (KMS)  customer  managed  key
          that's  used to encrypt your function's environment variables . When
          Lambda SnapStart is activated, Lambda also uses this key is  to  en-
          crypt  your function's snapshot. If you deploy your function using a
          container image, Lambda also uses this key to encrypt your  function
          when  it's  deployed. Note that this is not the same key that's used
          to protect your container image in the Amazon Elastic Container Reg-
          istry  (Amazon  ECR).  If  you don't provide a customer managed key,
          Lambda uses a default service key.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command

       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a Lambda function

       The  following  create-function example creates a Lambda function named
       my-function.

          aws lambda create-function \
              --function-name my-function \
              --runtime nodejs14.x \
              --zip-file fileb://my-function.zip \
              --handler my-function.handler \
              --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/MyTestFunction-role-tges6bf4

       Contents of my-function.zip: This file is  a  deployment  package  that
       contains your function code and any dependencies.
