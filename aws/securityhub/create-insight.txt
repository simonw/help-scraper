NAME
       create-insight -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates a custom insight in Security Hub. An insight is a consolidation
       of findings that relate to a security issue that requires attention  or
       remediation.

       To  group the related findings in the insight, use the GroupByAttribute
       .

OPTIONS
       --name (string)
          The name of the custom insight to create.

       --filters (structure)
          One or more attributes used to filter the findings included  in  the
          insight.  The insight only includes findings that match the criteria
          defined in the filters.

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that a finding is generated
              in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

          Type -> (list)
              A finding type in the  format  of  namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Confidence -> (list)
              A  finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood
              that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue  that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The level of importance assigned  to  the  resources  associated
              with the finding.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-

                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A  URL that links to a page about the current finding in the se-
              curity-findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A data type where security-findings providers can include  addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the  solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter

                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates the direction of network  traffic  associated  with  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings

                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

              finding.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
              The destination domain of network-related  information  about  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.

                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ThreatIntelIndicatorLastObservedAt -> (list)
              The  date/time  of the last observation of a threat intelligence
              indicator.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)
              The URL for more details from the source of the threat  intelli-

                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with

                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the Region
              is assigned to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The  canonical  Amazon  Web  Services external Region name where
              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-

                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start

                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

              key.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.

                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              The date/time that the container was started.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values
              are the following.

              o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it  is  reviewed.
                Security  Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to  either  WARNING  ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about the security issue. Used when the  initial  reviewer  is
                not  the  resource  owner, and needs intervention from the re-
                source owner. If one of the  following  occurs,  the  workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the  finding  and  do
                not  believe that any action is needed. The workflow status of
                a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if  RecordState  changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
                considered resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless  one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In those cases, the workflow status is  automatically  reset  to
              NEW .

              For  findings  from  controls,  if Compliance.Status is PASSED ,
              then Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to  RE-
              SOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

          RecordState -> (list)
              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The timestamp of when the note was updated.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A keyword filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value for the keyword.

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence. Confi-
              dence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding  accurately
              identifies  the  behavior or issue that it was intended to iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The  finding provider value for the level of importance assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no  criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The  finding  identifier of a related finding that is identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityOriginal -> (list)

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-

       --group-by-attribute (string)
          The attribute used to group the findings for the insight. The group-
          ing  attribute  identifies the type of item that the insight applies
          to. For example, if an insight is grouped  by  resource  identifier,
          then the insight produces a list of resource identifiers.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do not sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if  this  argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,  the
       socket  read  will be blocking and not timeout. The default value is 60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The maximum socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set  to  0,
       the  socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a custom insight

       The  following  create-insight  example  creates a custom insight named
       Critical role findings that returns critical findings that are  related
       to AWS roles.

          aws securityhub create-insight \
              --filters '{"ResourceType": [{ "Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "AwsIamRole"}], "SeverityLabel": [{"Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "CRITICAL"}]}' \
              --group-by-attribute "ResourceId" \
              --name "Critical role findings"

       Output:

          {
              "InsightArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"
          }

       For  more information, see Managing custom insights in the AWS Security
       Hub User Guide.

OUTPUT
       InsightArn -> (string)
          The ARN of the insight created.
