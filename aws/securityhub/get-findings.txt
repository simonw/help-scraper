GET-FINDINGS()                                                  GET-FINDINGS()



NAME
       get-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of findings that match the specified criteria.

       If  finding aggregation is enabled, then when you call GetFindings from
       the aggregation Region, the results include all of the  matching  find-
       ings from both the aggregation Region and the linked Regions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-findings is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Findings

SYNOPSIS
            get-findings
          [--filters <value>]
          [--sort-criteria <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --filters (structure)
          The finding attributes used to define a condition to filter the  re-
          turned findings.

          You  can  filter by up to 10 finding attributes. For each attribute,
          you can provide up to 20 filter values.

          Note that in the available filter fields,  WorkflowState  is  depre-
          cated.  To  search  for  a finding based on its workflow status, use
          WorkflowStatus .

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that a finding is generated
              in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

          Type -> (list)
              A finding type in the  format  of  namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Confidence -> (list)
              A  finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood
              that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue  that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The level of importance assigned  to  the  resources  associated
              with the finding.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-

                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A  URL that links to a page about the current finding in the se-
              curity-findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A data type where security-findings providers can include  addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              Note that this is a filter against the  aws/securityhub/Product-
              Name  field  in  ProductFields  .  It  is  not  a filter for the
              top-level ProductName field.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the  solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              Note  that this is a filter against the aws/securityhub/Company-
              Name field in ProductFields  .  It  is  not  a  filter  for  the
              top-level CompanyName field.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-

                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

              A  list  of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
              These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates the direction of network  traffic  associated  with  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of

                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
              The source media access control (MAC) address of network-related
              information about a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
              The destination domain of network-related  information  about  a
              finding.

                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ThreatIntelIndicatorLastObservedAt -> (list)
              The  date/time  of the last observation of a threat intelligence
              indicator.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the Region
              is assigned to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-

                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start

                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceIpV6Addresses -> (list)
              The IPv6 addresses associated with the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)

                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)

                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
              The name of the principal that is associated with an IAM  access
              key.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-

                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-

                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first

                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              The date/time that the container was started.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values
              are the following.

              o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it  is  reviewed.
                Security  Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to  either  WARNING  ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about the security issue. Used when the  initial  reviewer  is
                not  the  resource  owner, and needs intervention from the re-
                source owner. If one of the  following  occurs,  the  workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the  finding  and  do
                not  believe that any action is needed. The workflow status of
                a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if  RecordState  changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
                considered resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless  one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In those cases, the workflow status is  automatically  reset  to
              NEW .

              For  findings  from  controls,  if Compliance.Status is PASSED ,
              then Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to  RE-
              SOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

          RecordState -> (list)
              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The timestamp of when the note was updated.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A keyword filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value for the keyword.

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence. Confi-
              dence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding  accurately
              identifies  the  behavior or issue that it was intended to iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The  finding provider value for the level of importance assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no  criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The  finding  identifier of a related finding that is identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter

          FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
              The finding provider value for the severity label.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

       --sort-criteria (list)
          The finding attributes used to sort the list of returned findings.

          (structure)
              A collection of finding attributes used to sort findings.

              Field -> (string)
                 The finding attribute used to sort findings.

              SortOrder -> (string)
                 The order used to sort findings.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Field=string,SortOrder=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Field": "string",
              "SortOrder": "asc"|"desc"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To return findings generated for a specific standard

       The following get-findings example returns findings  for  the  PCI  DSS
       standard.

       Example  2:  To  return critical-severity findings that have a workflow
       status of NOTIFIED

       The following get-findings example returns findings that have a  sever-
       ity  label value of CRITICAL and a workflow status of NOTIFIED. The re-
       sults are sorted in descending order by the value of Confidence.

          aws securityhub get-findings \
              --filters '{"SeverityLabel":[{"Value": "CRITICAL","Comparison":"EQUALS"}],"WorkflowStatus": [{"Value":"NOTIFIED","Comparison":"EQUALS"}]}' \
              --sort-criteria '{ "Field": "Confidence", "SortOrder": "desc"}' \
              --max-items 1

              to  share findings between Amazon Web Services security services
              and third-party solutions, and security standards checks.

              NOTE:
                 A finding is a potential security issue generated  either  by
                 Amazon Web Services services or by the integrated third-party
                 solutions and standards checks.

                               create it.

                            DefaultAction -> (string)

                               (structure)
                                   Details for a rule in an WAF WebACL.

                                   Action -> (structure)
                                      Specifies the action that CloudFront  or
                                      WAF takes when a web request matches the
                                      conditions in the rule.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Specifies how you want  WAF  to  re-
                                          spond  to  requests  that  match the
                                          settings in a rule.

                                          Valid settings include  the  follow-
                                          ing:

                                          o ALLOW - WAF allows requests

                                          o BLOCK - WAF blocks requests

                                          o COUNT  -  WAF increments a counter
                                            of the requests that match all  of
                                            the  conditions  in  the rule. WAF
                                            then continues to inspect the  web
                                            request  based  on  the  remaining
                                            rules in the web  ACL.  You  can't
                                            specify  COUNT for the default ac-
                                            tion for a WebACL.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules to exclude from a rule group.

                                      (structure)
                                          Details about a rule to exclude from
                                          a rule group.

                                          RuleId -> (string)
                                             The  unique  identifier  for  the
                                             rule to  exclude  from  the  rule
                                             group.

                                   OverrideAction -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  OverrideAction  to  test  your
                                      RuleGroup.

                                      Any rule in a RuleGroup can  potentially
                                      block  a  request.  If you set the Over-
                                      rideAction  to  None  ,  the   RuleGroup
                                      blocks  a request if any individual rule
                                      in the RuleGroup matches the request and
                                      is configured to block that request.

                                      However,  if  you first want to test the
                                      RuleGroup,  set  the  OverrideAction  to
                                      Count . The RuleGroup then overrides any
                                      block  action  specified  by  individual
                                      rules  contained  within  the group. In-
                                      stead  of  blocking  matching  requests,
                                      those requests are counted.

                                      in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with  a
                                      lower  value  for Priority are evaluated
                                      before rules with a  higher  value.  The
                                      value  must  be a unique integer. If you

                               the  service.  The  role  allows the Amazon ECS
                               container agent to register container instances
                               with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

                            SchedulingStrategy -> (string)

                               The  REPLICA  scheduling  strategy  places  and
                               maintains the desired number  of  tasks  across
                               the  cluster. By default, the service scheduler
                               spreads tasks across Availability  Zones.  Task
                               placement  strategies  and constraints are used
                               to customize task placement decisions.

                               The DAEMON scheduling strategy deploys  exactly
                               one task on each active container instance that
                               meets all of  the  task  placement  constraints
                               that  are specified in the cluster. The service
                               scheduler also  evaluates  the  task  placement
                               constraints  for  running tasks and stops tasks
                               that do not meet the placement constraints.
