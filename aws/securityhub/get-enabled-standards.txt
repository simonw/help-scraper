NAME
       get-enabled-standards -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the standards that are currently enabled.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-enabled-standards  is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may
       be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: StandardsSubscriptions

SYNOPSIS
            get-enabled-standards
          [--standards-subscription-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --standards-subscription-arns (list)
          The list of the standards subscription ARNs for the standards to re-
          trieve.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To retrieve information about an enabled standard

       The following get-enabled-standards example retrieves information about
       the PCI DSS standard.

          aws securityhub get-enabled-standards \
              --standards-subscription-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"

       Output:

          {
              "StandardsSubscriptions": [
                  {
                      "StandardsArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1::standards/pci-dss/v/3.2.1",
                      "StandardsInput": { },
                      "StandardsStatus": "READY",
                      "StandardsSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:subscription/pci-dss/v/3.2.1"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       StandardsSubscriptions -> (list)
          The  list of StandardsSubscriptions objects that include information
          about the enabled standards.

          (structure)
              A resource that represents  your  subscription  to  a  supported
              standard.

              StandardsSubscriptionArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN of a resource that represents your subscription to a
                 supported standard.

              StandardsArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a standard.

              StandardsInput -> (map)
                 A key-value pair of input for the standard.

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              StandardsStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the standard subscription.

                 The status values are as follows:

                 o PENDING - Standard is in the process of being enabled.

                 o READY - Standard is enabled.

                 o INCOMPLETE - Standard could not be enabled completely. Some
