BATCH-IMPORT-FINDINGS()                                BATCH-IMPORT-FINDINGS()



NAME
       batch-import-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Imports security findings generated by a finding provider into Security
       Hub. This action is requested by the finding  provider  to  import  its
       findings into Security Hub.
          BatchImportFindings must be called by one of the following:

       o The  Amazon Web Services account that is associated with a finding if
         you are using the default product ARN or are a partner sending  find-
         ings  from  within a customer's Amazon Web Services account. In these
         cases, the identifier of the account that you  are  calling  BatchIm-
         portFindings  from needs to be the same as the AwsAccountId attribute
         for the finding.

       o An Amazon Web Services account that Security Hub has allow-listed for
         an  official partner integration. In this case, you can call BatchIm-
         portFindings from the allow-listed account  and  send  findings  from
         different customer accounts in the same batch.

       The  maximum allowed size for a finding is 240 Kb. An error is returned
       for any finding larger than 240 Kb.

       After a finding is created, BatchImportFindings cannot be used  to  up-
       date  the following finding fields and objects, which Security Hub cus-
       tomers use to manage their investigation workflow.

       o Note

       o UserDefinedFields

       o VerificationState

       o Workflow

       Finding providers also should not use BatchImportFindings to update the
       following attributes.

       o Confidence

       o Criticality

       o RelatedFindings

       o Severity

       o Types

       Instead,  finding providers use FindingProviderFields to provide values
       for these attributes.

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --findings (list)
          A list of findings to import. To successfully import a  finding,  it
          must  follow the Amazon Web Services Security Finding Format . Maxi-
          mum of 100 findings per request.

          (structure)
              Provides consistent format for  the  contents  of  the  Security
              Hub-aggregated  findings.  AwsSecurityFinding format enables you
              to share findings between Amazon Web Services security  services
              and third-party solutions, and security standards checks.

              NOTE:
                 A  finding  is a potential security issue generated either by
                 Amazon Web Services services or by the integrated third-party
                 solutions and standards checks.

                                          the credentials only if  they  exist
                                          in  your current Amazon Web Services
                                          Region.

                                   CredentialProvider -> (string)

                                      conditions in the rule.

                                      Type -> (string)
                                          Specifies how you want  WAF  to  re-
                                          spond  to  requests  that  match the
                                          settings in a rule.

                                          Valid settings include  the  follow-
                                          ing:

                                          o ALLOW - WAF allows requests

                                          o BLOCK - WAF blocks requests

                                          o COUNT  -  WAF increments a counter
                                            of the requests that match all  of
                                            the  conditions  in  the rule. WAF
                                            then continues to inspect the  web
                                            request  based  on  the  remaining
                                            rules in the web  ACL.  You  can't
                                            specify  COUNT for the default ac-
                                            tion for a web ACL.

                                   ExcludedRules -> (list)
                                      Rules to exclude from a rule group.

                                      (structure)
                                          Details about a rule to exclude from
                                          a rule group.

                                          RuleId -> (string)
                                             The  unique  identifier  for  the
                                             rule to  exclude  from  the  rule
                                             group.

                                   OverrideAction -> (structure)
                                      Use  the  OverrideAction  to  test  your
                                      RuleGroup .

                                      Any rule in a RuleGroup can  potentially
                                      block  a  request.  If you set the Over-
                                      rideAction  to  None  ,  the   RuleGroup
                                      blocks  a request if any individual rule
                                      in the RuleGroup matches the request and
                                      is configured to block that request.

                                      However,  if  you first want to test the
                                      RuleGroup , set  the  OverrideAction  to
                                      Count . The RuleGroup then overrides any
                                      block  action  specified  by  individual
                                      rules  contained  within  the group. In-
                                      stead  of  blocking  matching  requests,
                                      those requests are counted.
                                          ActivatedRule

                                          OverrideAction applies only when up-
                                          dating or adding a  RuleGroup  to  a
                                          web ACL. In this case you do not use
                                          ActivatedRule   Action  .  For   all
                                          other update requests, ActivatedRule
                                          Action is used instead of  Activate-
                                          dRule  OverrideAction .

                                      Type -> (string)
                                             COUNT overrides the action speci-
                                             fied   by   the  individual  rule
                                             within a RuleGroup .

                                          If set to NONE , the  rule's  action
                                          takes place.

                                   Priority -> (integer)
                                      Specifies  the  order in which the rules
                                      in a web ACL are evaluated. Rules with a
                                      lower  value  for Priority are evaluated
                                      before rules with a  higher  value.  The
                                      value  must  be a unique integer. If you
                                      add multiple rules to  a  web  ACL,  the
                                      values do not need to be consecutive.

                                   RuleId -> (string)
                                      The identifier for a rule.

                               on Fargate. If a platform version is not speci-
                               fied, the LATEST platform version  is  used  by
                               default.

                               the  service.  The  role  allows the Amazon ECS
                               container agent to register container instances
                               with an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer.

                            SchedulingStrategy -> (string)

                               maintains the desired number  of  tasks  across
                               the  cluster. By default, the service scheduler
                               spreads tasks across Availability  Zones.  Task
                               placement  strategies  and constraints are used
                               to customize task placement decisions.

                               The DAEMON scheduling strategy deploys  exactly
                               one task on each active container instance that
                               meets all of  the  task  placement  constraints
                               that  are specified in the cluster. The service
                               scheduler also  evaluates  the  task  placement
                               constraints  for  running tasks and stops tasks
                               that do not meet the placement constraints.

                               metric.  For  an  alarm based on a math expres-
                               sion, you can't specify Namespace and  you  use
                               Metrics instead.

                               For  an alarm based on a metric, you must spec-
                               ify either Statistic or  ExtendedStatistic  but
                               not both.

                         ING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o NOTIFIED - Indicates that  you  notified  the  resource
                       owner  about  the security issue. Used when the initial
                       reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs interven-
                       tion from the resource owner.

                     o SUPPRESSED  -  Indicates  that you reviewed the finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The find-
                       ing is no longer updated.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .
