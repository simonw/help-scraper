GET-INSIGHTS()                                                  GET-INSIGHTS()



NAME
       get-insights -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists and describes insights for the specified insight ARNs.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       get-insights is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Insights

SYNOPSIS
            get-insights
          [--insight-arns <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --insight-arns (list)
          The ARNs of the insights to describe. If you do not provide any  in-
          sight ARNs, then GetInsights returns all of your custom insights. It
          does not return any managed insights.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Insights -> (list)
          The insights returned by the operation.

          (structure)
              Contains information about a Security Hub insight.

              InsightArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of a Security Hub insight.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of a Security Hub insight.

              Filters -> (structure)
                 One or more attributes used to filter the  findings  included
                 in the insight. The insight only includes findings that match
                 the criteria defined in the filters.

                 ProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN generated by Security Hub that  uniquely  identi-
                     fies  a  third-party company (security findings provider)
                     after this provider's product  (solution  that  generates
                     findings) is registered with Security Hub.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 AwsAccountId -> (list)
                     The Amazon Web Services account ID that a finding is gen-
                     erated in.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Id -> (list)
                     The security findings provider-specific identifier for  a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 GeneratorId -> (list)
                     The  identifier  for  the  solution-specific component (a
                     discrete unit of logic) that generated a finding. In var-
                     ious security-findings providers' solutions, this genera-
                     tor can be called a rule, a check, a detector, a  plugin,
                     etc.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)

                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                     A  finding type in the format of namespace/category/clas-
                     sifier that classifies a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Confidence -> (list)
                     A  finding's  confidence.  Confidence  is  defined as the
                     likelihood that a finding accurately identifies  the  be-
                     havior or issue that it was intended to identify.

                     Confidence  is  scored  on  a  0-100  basis using a ratio
                     scale, where 0 means  zero  percent  confidence  and  100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Criticality -> (list)
                     The level of importance assigned to the resources associ-
                     ated with the finding.

                     A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no
                     criticality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the  most
                     critical resources.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)

                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 Title -> (list)
                     A finding's title.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,

                              matches findings that have a resource type other

                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 SourceUrl -> (list)
                     A  URL  that links to a page about the current finding in
                     the security-findings provider's solution.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ProductFields -> (list)
                     A data type where security-findings providers can include
                     additional  solution-specific details that aren't part of
                     the defined AwsSecurityFinding format.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for querying findings.  Each  map  filter
                        provides  the  field  to check, the value to look for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key of the map filter. For  example,  for  Re-
                            sourceTags  ,  Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For UserDefinedFields , Key is  the  name  of  the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values  for a tag called Department might be Secu-
                            rity . If  you  provide  security  as  the  filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  the  key value when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value,  use EQUALS . For example, for the Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches  findings that have the value Security for
                            the tag Department .

                            To search for values other than the filter  value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field, the filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do not have the value Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS filters on the same field are joined  by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by  AND  . A finding matches only if it matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ProductName -> (list)
                     The  name  of the solution (product) that generates find-
                     ings.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 CompanyName -> (list)
                     The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the
                     solution (product) that generates findings.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 UserDefinedFields -> (list)
                     A  list  of  name/value  string pairs associated with the
                     finding. These are custom, user-defined fields added to a
                     finding.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches findings that do not have  the  value  Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 MalwareName -> (list)
                     The name of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-

                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 MalwareType -> (list)
                     The type of the malware that was observed.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case

                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of

                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-

                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.

                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-

                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NetworkProtocol -> (list)
                     The protocol of network-related information about a find-
                     ing.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other

                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.

                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-

                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NetworkSourceMac -> (list)
                     The  source  media  access  control (MAC) address of net-
                     work-related information about a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     (structure)
                        The IP filter for querying findings.

                        Cidr -> (string)

                 NetworkDestinationPort -> (list)
                     The destination port of network-related information about
                     a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The less-than-equal condition to be applied  to  a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The  equal-to  condition to be applied to a single

                 NetworkDestinationDomain -> (list)
                     The destination  domain  of  network-related  information
                     about a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the

                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ProcessPath -> (list)
                     The path to the process executable.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorValue -> (list)
                     The value of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorCategory -> (list)
                     The category of a threat intelligence indicator.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case

                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)

                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)
                     The URL for more details from the source  of  the  threat
                     intelligence.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceType -> (list)
                     Specifies  the type of the resource that details are pro-
                     vided for.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that

                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourcePartition -> (list)
                     The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the
                     Region is assigned to.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceRegion -> (list)
                     The  canonical  Amazon  Web Services external Region name
                     where this resource is located.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceTags -> (list)
                     A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a  re-
                     source at the time the finding was processed.

                     (structure)
                        A  map  filter  for querying findings. Each map filter
                        provides the field to check, the value  to  look  for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The  key  of  the map filter. For example, for Re-
                            sourceTags , Key identifies the name of  the  tag.
                            For  UserDefinedFields  ,  Key  is the name of the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The value for the key in the  map  filter.  Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values for a tag called Department might be  Secu-
                            rity  .  If  you  provide  security  as the filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to  apply  to  the  key  value  when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value, use EQUALS . For example, for the  Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches findings that have the value Security  for
                            the tag Department .

                            To  search for values other than the filter value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field,  the  filter  Department NOT_EQUALS Finance
                            matches findings that do not have  the  value  Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by AND . A finding matches only if  it  matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You  cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
                     The instance type of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsEc2InstanceVpcId -> (list)
                     The identifier of the VPC that the instance was  launched
                     in.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the

                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings

                     The date and time the instance was launched.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
                     The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                 ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerName -> (list)
                     The display name of the owner of the S3 bucket.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case

                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the

                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                              matches findings that have a resource type other

                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
                     The  name of the principal that is associated with an IAM
                     access key.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyStatus -> (list)
                     The status of the IAM access key related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that

                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerName -> (list)
                     The name of the container related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-

                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerImageId -> (list)
                     The identifier of the image related to a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case

                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
                     The date/time that the container was started.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
                     The  details  of  a resource that doesn't have a specific
                     subfield for the resource type defined.

                     (structure)
                        A map filter for querying findings.  Each  map  filter
                        provides  the  field  to check, the value to look for,
                        and the comparison operator.

                        Key -> (string)
                            The key of the map filter. For  example,  for  Re-
                            sourceTags  ,  Key identifies the name of the tag.
                            For UserDefinedFields , Key is  the  name  of  the
                            field.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter
                            values are case sensitive. For example, one of the
                            values  for a tag called Department might be Secu-
                            rity . If  you  provide  security  as  the  filter
                            value, then there is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  the  key value when
                            querying for findings with a map filter.

                            To search for values that exactly match the filter
                            value,  use EQUALS . For example, for the Resourc-
                            eTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security
                            matches  findings that have the value Security for
                            the tag Department .

                            To search for values other than the filter  value,
                            use NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags
                            field, the filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance
                            matches  findings  that  do not have the value Fi-
                            nance for the tag Department .
                               EQUALS filters on the same field are joined  by
                               OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of
                               those filters.

                               NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined
                               by  AND  . A finding matches only if it matches
                               all of those filters.

                            You cannot  have  both  an  EQUALS  filter  and  a
                            NOT_EQUALS filter on the same field.

                 ComplianceStatus -> (list)
                     Exclusive to findings that are generated as the result of
                     a check run against a specific rule in a supported  stan-
                     dard,  such  as CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Con-
                     tains security standard-related finding details.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-
                               ters.

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 VerificationState -> (list)
                     The veracity of a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when
                            querying  for  findings. To search for values that
                            contain the filter criteria value, use one of  the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                              ResourceType   EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup  only
                              matches findings that have a  resource  type  of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To  search for values that start with the filter
                              value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter  Re-
                              sourceType  PREFIX  AwsIam matches findings that
                              have a resource type that starts with  AwsIam  .
                              Findings  with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined  by OR . A finding matches if it matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To search for values that do not contain the  fil-
                            ter  criteria value, use one of the following com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To search for values that do not  exactly  match
                              the  filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example,
                              the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To search for values that do not start with  the
                              filter  value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For exam-
                              ple, the filter  ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam  matches  findings  that  have a resource
                              type that does not start with AwsIam .  Findings
                              with  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIam-
                              Role , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded  from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A  finding
                               matches  only  if  it matches all of those fil-

                            For filters on the same field, you cannot  provide
                            both  an  EQUALS  filter  and a NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 WorkflowState -> (list)
                     The workflow state of a finding.

                     Note that this field is deprecated. To search for a find-
                     ing based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 WorkflowStatus -> (list)
                     The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed
                     values are the following.

                     o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it is  re-
                       viewed.  Security  Hub  also resets the workflow status
                       from NOTIFIED or  RESOLVED  to  NEW  in  the  following
                       cases:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to either WARN-
                         ING , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner  has  been
                       notified  about  the security issue. Used when the ini-
                       tial reviewer is not the resource owner, and needs  in-
                       tervention  from the resource owner. If one of the fol-
                       lowing occurs, the workflow status is changed automati-
                       cally from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you  reviewed  the  finding
                       and do not believe that any action is needed. The work-
                       flow status of a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if
                       RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                     o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and
                       is now considered resolved.  The  finding  remains  RE-
                       SOLVED unless one of the following occurs:

                       o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                       o Compliance.Status  changes  from  PASSED  to FAILED ,
                         WARNING , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

                     In those cases, the workflow status is automatically  re-
                     set to NEW .

                     For  findings  from  controls,  if  Compliance.Status  is
                     PASSED , then Security Hub automatically sets  the  work-
                     flow status to RESOLVED .

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RecordState -> (list)
                     The updated record state for the finding.

                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN of the solution that generated a related finding.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-

                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 RelatedFindingsId -> (list)
                     The solution-generated identifier for a related finding.

                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case

                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
                     The timestamp of when the note was updated.

                     (structure)
                        A date filter for querying findings.

                        Start -> (string)
                            A start date for the date filter.

                        End -> (string)
                            An end date for the date filter.

                        DateRange -> (structure)
                            A date range for the date filter.

                            Value -> (integer)
                               A date range value for the date filter.

                            Unit -> (string)
                               A date range unit for the date filter.

                 NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
                     The principal that created a note.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Keyword -> (list)
                     A keyword for a finding.

                     (structure)
                        A keyword filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            A value for the keyword.

                 FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
                     The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence.
                     Confidence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding
                     accurately  identifies  the behavior or issue that it was
                     intended to identify.

                     Confidence is scored on  a  0-100  basis  using  a  ratio
                     scale,  where  0  means  zero  percent confidence and 100
                     means 100 percent confidence.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)
                            The greater-than-equal condition to be applied  to
                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
                     The  finding  provider  value for the level of importance
                     assigned to the resources associated with the findings.

                     A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have  no
                     criticality,  and a score of 100 is reserved for the most
                     critical resources.

                     (structure)
                        A number filter for querying findings.

                        Gte -> (double)

                            a single field when querying for findings.

                        Lte -> (double)
                            The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a
                            single field when querying for findings.

                        Eq -> (double)
                            The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single
                            field when querying for findings.

                 FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
                     The finding identifier of a related finding that is iden-
                     tified by the finding provider.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The string filter value. Filter  values  are  case
                            sensitive.  For example, the product name for con-
                            trol-based findings is Security Hub . If you  pro-
                            vide  security  hub as the filter text, then there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The condition to apply  to  a  string  value  when

                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters  in  this
                            way  always returns an error, even if the provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS  or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters for the same field. Se-
                            curity Hub first  processes  the  PREFIX  filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For  example,  for  the following filter, Security
                            Hub first identifies findings that  have  resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then excludes findings that have a  resource  type
                            of  AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsProductArn -> (list)
                     The ARN of the solution that generated a related  finding
                     that is identified by the finding provider.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 FindingProviderFieldsSeverityLabel -> (list)
                     The finding provider value for the severity label.

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-

                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that

                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.

                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 FindingProviderFieldsTypes -> (list)
                     One  or  more finding types that the finding provider as-
                     signed to the finding. Uses the format of namespace/cate-
                     gory/classifier that classify a finding.

                     Valid  namespace  values  are: Software and Configuration
                     Checks | TTPs | Effects | Unusual Behaviors  |  Sensitive
                     Data Identifications

                     (structure)
                        A string filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (string)
                            The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case
                            sensitive. For example, the product name for  con-
                            trol-based  findings is Security Hub . If you pro-
                            vide security hub as the filter text,  then  there
                            is no match.

                        Comparison -> (string)
                            The  condition  to  apply  to  a string value when
                            querying for findings. To search for  values  that
                            contain  the filter criteria value, use one of the
                            following comparison operators:

                            o To search for values that exactly match the fil-
                              ter  value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter
                              ResourceType  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup   only
                              matches  findings  that  have a resource type of
                              AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                            o To search for values that start with the  filter
                              value,  use PREFIX . For example, the filter Re-
                              sourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches  findings  that
                              have  a  resource type that starts with AwsIam .
                              Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,
                              AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.
                               EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are
                               joined by OR . A finding matches if it  matches
                               any one of those filters.

                            To  search for values that do not contain the fil-
                            ter criteria value, use one of the following  com-
                            parison operators:

                            o To  search  for values that do not exactly match
                              the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For  example,
                              the  filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy
                              matches findings that have a resource type other
                              than AwsIamPolicy .

                            o To  search for values that do not start with the
                              filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For  exam-
                              ple,  the  filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS
                              AwsIam matches findings  that  have  a  resource
                              type  that does not start with AwsIam . Findings
                              with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy  ,  AwsIam-
                              Role  , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                              the results.
                               NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the
                               same  field  are  joined  by  AND  .  A finding
                               matches only if it matches all  of  those  fil-
                               ters.

                            For  filters on the same field, you cannot provide
                            both an EQUALS filter and  a  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                            FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filter.  Combining filters in this
                            way always returns an error, even if the  provided
                            filter values would return valid results.

                            You  can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or
                            PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Se-
                            curity  Hub  first  processes  the PREFIX filters,
                            then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                            For example, for the  following  filter,  Security
                            Hub  first  identifies findings that have resource
                            types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It
                            then  excludes  findings that have a resource type
                            of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a  resource
                            type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                            o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                            o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                 Sample -> (list)
                     Indicates  whether or not sample findings are included in
                     the filter results.

                     (structure)
                        Boolean filter for querying findings.

                        Value -> (boolean)
                            The value of the boolean.

              GroupByAttribute -> (string)
                 The grouping attribute for the insight's findings.  Indicates
                 how  to  group the matching findings, and identifies the type
                 of item that the insight applies to. For example, if  an  in-
                 sight  is  grouped  by  resource identifier, then the insight
                 produces a list of resource identifiers.

       NextToken -> (string)
          The pagination token to use to request the next page of results.
