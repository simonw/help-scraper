BATCH-UPDATE-FINDINGS()                                BATCH-UPDATE-FINDINGS()



NAME
       batch-update-findings -

DESCRIPTION
       Used by Security Hub customers to update information about their inves-
       tigation into a finding. Requested by administrator accounts or  member
       accounts.  Administrator accounts can update findings for their account
       and their member accounts. Member  accounts  can  update  findings  for
       their account.

       Updates  from  BatchUpdateFindings do not affect the value of UpdatedAt
       for a finding.

       Administrator and member accounts can use BatchUpdateFindings to update
       the following finding fields and objects.

       o Confidence

       o Criticality

       o Note

       o RelatedFindings

       o Severity

       o Types

       o UserDefinedFields

       o VerificationState

       o Workflow

       You  can  configure IAM policies to restrict access to fields and field
       values. For example, you might not want member accounts to be  able  to
       suppress  findings  or change the finding severity. See Configuring ac-
       cess to BatchUpdateFindings in the Security Hub User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --finding-identifiers (list)
          The list of findings to update. BatchUpdateFindings can be  used  to
          update up to 100 findings at a time.

          For  each  finding, the list provides the finding identifier and the
          ARN of the finding provider.

          (structure)
              Identifies a finding to update using BatchUpdateFindings .

              Id -> (string)
                 The identifier of the finding that was specified by the find-
                 ing provider.

              ProductArn -> (string)
                 The  ARN generated by Security Hub that uniquely identifies a
                 product that generates findings. This can be the  ARN  for  a
                 third-party  product that is integrated with Security Hub, or
                 the ARN for a custom integration.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Id=string,ProductArn=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {

            "UpdatedBy": "string"
          }

       --severity (structure)
          Used to update the finding severity.

          Normalized -> (integer)
              The normalized severity for the finding. This attribute is to be
              deprecated in favor of Label .

              If  you  provide  Normalized and do not provide Label , Label is
              set automatically as follows.

              o 0 - INFORMATIONAL

              o 139 - LOW

              o 4069 - MEDIUM

              o 7089 - HIGH

              o 90100 - CRITICAL

          Product -> (double)
              The native severity as defined by the Amazon Web  Services  ser-
              vice or integrated partner product that generated the finding.

          Label -> (string)
              The  severity  value  of the finding. The allowed values are the
              following.

              o INFORMATIONAL - No issue was found.

              o LOW - The issue does not require action on its own.

              o MEDIUM - The issue must be addressed but not urgently.

              o HIGH - The issue must be addressed as a priority.

              o CRITICAL - The issue must be remediated immediately  to  avoid
                it escalating.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Normalized=integer,Product=double,Label=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Normalized": integer,
            "Product": double,
            "Label": "INFORMATIONAL"|"LOW"|"MEDIUM"|"HIGH"|"CRITICAL"
          }

       --verification-state (string)
          Indicates the veracity of a finding.

          The available values for VerificationState are as follows.

          o UNKNOWN  The default disposition of a security finding

          o TRUE_POSITIVE  The security finding is confirmed

          o FALSE_POSITIVE   The security finding was determined to be a false
            alarm

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE  A special case of TRUE_POSITIVE where the finding
            doesn't pose any threat, is expected, or both

          Possible values:

          o UNKNOWN

          o TRUE_POSITIVE

          o FALSE_POSITIVE

          o BENIGN_POSITIVE

       --confidence (integer)
          The  updated value for the finding confidence. Confidence is defined
          as the likelihood that a finding accurately identifies the  behavior
          or issue that it was intended to identify.

          Confidence  is  scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where 0
          means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confidence.

       --criticality (integer)
          The updated value for the level of importance assigned  to  the  re-
          sources associated with the findings.

          A  score  of 0 means that the underlying resources have no critical-
          ity, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical resources.

       --types (list)
          One or more finding types in the format of  namespace/category/clas-
          sifier that classify a finding.

          Valid namespace values are as follows.

          o Software and Configuration Checks

          o TTPs

          o Effects

          o Unusual Behaviors

          o Sensitive Data Identifications

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --user-defined-fields (map)
          A list of name/value string pairs associated with the finding. These
          are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

          key -> (string)

          value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {"string": "string"
            ...}

       --workflow (structure)
          Used to update the workflow status of a finding.

          The workflow status indicates the progress of the investigation into
          the finding.

          Status -> (string)
              The  status  of the investigation into the finding. The workflow
              status is specific to an individual finding. It does not  affect
              the  generation  of new findings. For example, setting the work-
              flow status to SUPPRESSED or RESOLVED does  not  prevent  a  new
              finding for the same issue.

              The allowed values are the following.

              o NEW  -  The initial state of a finding, before it is reviewed.
                Security Hub also resets WorkFlowStatus from NOTIFIED  or  RE-
                SOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o The record state changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o The  compliance status changes from PASSED to either WARNING
                  , FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that  you  notified  the  resource  owner
                about  the  security  issue. Used when the initial reviewer is
                not the resource owner, and needs intervention  from  the  re-
                source owner.

              o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
                considered resolved.

              o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the  finding  and  do
                not  believe  that  any  action  is  needed. The finding is no
                longer updated.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Status=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Status": "NEW"|"NOTIFIED"|"RESOLVED"|"SUPPRESSED"
          }

       --related-findings (list)
          A list of findings that are related to the updated findings.

          (structure)
              Details about a related finding.

              ProductArn -> (string)
                 The ARN of the product that generated a related finding.

              Id -> (string)
                 The product-generated identifier for a related finding.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ProductArn=string,Id=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ProductArn": "string",
              "Id": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.
