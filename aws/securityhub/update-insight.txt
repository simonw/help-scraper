OPTIONS
       --insight-arn (string)
          The ARN of the insight that you want to update.

       --name (string)
          The updated name for the insight.

       --filters (structure)
          The updated filters that define this insight.

          ProductArn -> (list)
              The ARN generated by Security Hub  that  uniquely  identifies  a
              third-party  company  (security  findings  provider)  after this
              provider's product (solution that generates findings) is  regis-
              tered with Security Hub.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          AwsAccountId -> (list)
              The  Amazon  Web Services account ID that a finding is generated
              in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-

                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Region -> (list)
              The Region from which the finding was generated.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Type -> (list)
              A finding type in the  format  of  namespace/category/classifier
              that classifies a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Confidence -> (list)
              A  finding's confidence. Confidence is defined as the likelihood
              that a finding accurately identifies the behavior or issue  that
              it was intended to identify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The  greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The less-than-equal condition to be applied to  a  single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Criticality -> (list)
              The level of importance assigned  to  the  resources  associated
              with the finding.

              A  score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

          Title -> (list)
              A finding's title.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same

                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          SourceUrl -> (list)
              A  URL that links to a page about the current finding in the se-
              curity-findings provider's solution.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ProductFields -> (list)
              A data type where security-findings providers can include  addi-
              tional solution-specific details that aren't part of the defined
              AwsSecurityFinding format.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ProductName -> (list)
              The name of the solution (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start

          CompanyName -> (list)
              The name of the findings provider (company) that owns the  solu-
              tion (product) that generates findings.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS

          UserDefinedFields -> (list)
              A  list  of name/value string pairs associated with the finding.
              These are custom, user-defined fields added to a finding.

              (structure)
                 A map filter for querying findings. Each map filter  provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The key of the map filter. For example, for  ResourceTags
                     ,  Key  identifies  the name of the tag. For UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The value for the key in the map  filter.  Filter  values
                     are  case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a
                     tag called Department might be Security . If you  provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department EQUALS Security matches  findings  that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To  search  for  values  other than the filter value, use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS  filters on the same field are joined by OR . A
                        finding matches if it matches any one  of  those  fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        . A finding matches only if it matches  all  of  those
                        filters.

                     You  cannot  have  both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          MalwareName -> (list)
              The name of the malware that was observed.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          NetworkDirection -> (list)
              Indicates the direction of network  traffic  associated  with  a
              finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

                     The  equal-to  condition  to be applied to a single field
                     when querying for findings.

              finding.

              (structure)

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter

                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all

                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-

              The  date/time  of the last observation of a threat intelligence
              indicator.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSource -> (list)
              The source of the threat intelligence.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ThreatIntelIndicatorSourceUrl -> (list)

                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from

                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourcePartition -> (list)
              The canonical Amazon Web Services partition name that the Region
              is assigned to.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

          ResourceRegion -> (list)
              The  canonical  Amazon  Web  Services external Region name where
              this resource is located.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-

                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start

                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceTags -> (list)
              A list of Amazon Web Services tags associated with a resource at
              the time the finding was processed.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceType -> (list)
              The instance type of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceImageId -> (list)
              The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceSubnetId -> (list)
              The identifier of the subnet that the instance was launched in.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          ResourceAwsEc2InstanceLaunchedAt -> (list)

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceAwsS3BucketOwnerId -> (list)
              The canonical user ID of the owner of the S3 bucket.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

          ResourceAwsIamAccessKeyPrincipalName -> (list)
              The name of the principal that is associated with an IAM  access
              key.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-

                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-

                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type

          ResourceContainerLaunchedAt -> (list)
              The date/time that the container was started.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          ResourceDetailsOther -> (list)
              The details of a resource that doesn't have a specific  subfield
              for the resource type defined.

              (structure)
                 A  map filter for querying findings. Each map filter provides
                 the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison
                 operator.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The  key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags
                     , Key identifies the name of the  tag.  For  UserDefined-
                     Fields , Key is the name of the field.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  value  for  the key in the map filter. Filter values
                     are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for  a
                     tag  called Department might be Security . If you provide
                     security as the filter value, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to the key value when querying for
                     findings with a map filter.

                     To search for values that exactly match the filter value,
                     use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter  Department  EQUALS Security matches findings that
                     have the value Security for the tag Department .

                     To search for values other than  the  filter  value,  use
                     NOT_EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the
                     filter Department  NOT_EQUALS  Finance  matches  findings
                     that do not have the value Finance for the tag Department
                     .
                        EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by OR .  A
                        finding  matches  if  it matches any one of those fil-
                        ters.

                        NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND
                        .  A  finding  matches only if it matches all of those
                        filters.

                     You cannot have both an EQUALS filter  and  a  NOT_EQUALS
                     filter on the same field.

          ComplianceStatus -> (list)
              Exclusive  to  findings  that  are  generated as the result of a
              check run against a specific rule in a supported standard,  such
              as  CIS Amazon Web Services Foundations. Contains security stan-
              dard-related finding details.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          VerificationState -> (list)
              The veracity of a finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of
                        those filters.

                     To search for values that do not contain the filter  cri-
                     teria  value,  use one of the following comparison opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with
                       AwsIam  . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS  fil-
                     ter.  Combining filters in this way always returns an er-
                     ror, even if the  provided  filter  values  would  return
                     valid results.

                     You  can  combine  PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field.  Security  Hub
                     first  processes  the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies  findings  that have resource types that start
                     with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes  findings
                     that  have  a  resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowState -> (list)
              The workflow state of a finding.

              Note that this field is deprecated.  To  search  for  a  finding
              based on its workflow status, use WorkflowStatus .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same

                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          WorkflowStatus -> (list)
              The  status  of the investigation into a finding. Allowed values
              are the following.

              o NEW - The initial state of a finding, before it  is  reviewed.
                Security  Hub also resets the workflow status from NOTIFIED or
                RESOLVED to NEW in the following cases:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status changes from PASSED to  either  WARNING  ,
                  FAILED , or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o NOTIFIED - Indicates that the resource owner has been notified
                about the security issue. Used when the  initial  reviewer  is
                not  the  resource  owner, and needs intervention from the re-
                source owner. If one of the  following  occurs,  the  workflow
                status is changed automatically from NOTIFIED to NEW :

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              o SUPPRESSED - Indicates that you reviewed the  finding  and  do
                not  believe that any action is needed. The workflow status of
                a SUPPRESSED finding does not change  if  RecordState  changes
                from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

              o RESOLVED  - The finding was reviewed and remediated and is now
                considered resolved.  The finding remains RESOLVED unless  one
                of the following occurs:

                o RecordState changes from ARCHIVED to ACTIVE .

                o Compliance.Status  changes from PASSED to FAILED , WARNING ,
                  or NOT_AVAILABLE .

              In those cases, the workflow status is  automatically  reset  to
              NEW .

              For  findings  from  controls,  if Compliance.Status is PASSED ,
              then Security Hub automatically sets the workflow status to  RE-
              SOLVED .

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

              The updated record state for the finding.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

          NoteUpdatedAt -> (list)
              The timestamp of when the note was updated.

              (structure)
                 A date filter for querying findings.

                 Start -> (string)
                     A start date for the date filter.

                 End -> (string)
                     An end date for the date filter.

                 DateRange -> (structure)
                     A date range for the date filter.

                     Value -> (integer)
                        A date range value for the date filter.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        A date range unit for the date filter.

          NoteUpdatedBy -> (list)
              The principal that created a note.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-
                     tive. For example, the  product  name  for  control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying
                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy

                     o ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface

          Keyword -> (list)
              A keyword for a finding.

              (structure)
                 A keyword filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     A value for the keyword.

          FindingProviderFieldsConfidence -> (list)
              The  finding  provider  value for the finding confidence. Confi-
              dence is defined as the likelihood  that  a  finding  accurately
              identifies  the  behavior or issue that it was intended to iden-
              tify.

              Confidence is scored on a 0-100 basis using a ratio scale, where
              0 means zero percent confidence and 100 means 100 percent confi-
              dence.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                 Gte -> (double)
                     The greater-than-equal condition to be applied to a  sin-
                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsCriticality -> (list)
              The  finding provider value for the level of importance assigned
              to the resources associated with the findings.

              A score of 0 means that the underlying resources have no  criti-
              cality, and a score of 100 is reserved for the most critical re-
              sources.

              (structure)
                 A number filter for querying findings.

                     gle field when querying for findings.

                 Lte -> (double)
                     The  less-than-equal  condition to be applied to a single
                     field when querying for findings.

                 Eq -> (double)
                     The equal-to condition to be applied to  a  single  field
                     when querying for findings.

          FindingProviderFieldsRelatedFindingsId -> (list)
              The  finding  identifier of a related finding that is identified
              by the finding provider.

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The string filter value. Filter values  are  case  sensi-
                     tive.  For  example,  the  product name for control-based
                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The  condition  to  apply to a string value when querying
                     for findings. To search for values that contain the  fil-
                     ter  criteria  value, use one of the following comparison
                     operators:

                     o To search for values  that  exactly  match  the  filter
                       value,  use  EQUALS . For example, the filter Resource-
                       Type EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To  search for values that start with the filter value,
                       use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType  PRE-
                       FIX  AwsIam  matches findings that have a resource type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of  AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by  OR  .  A  finding matches if it matches any one of

                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To  search for values that do not start with the filter
                       value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the  filter
                       ResourceType  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings
                       that have a resource type  that  does  not  start  with

                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS  and  PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it

                     for  findings. To search for values that contain the fil-
                     ter criteria value, use one of the  following  comparison
                     operators:

                     o To  search  for  values  that  exactly match the filter
                       value, use EQUALS . For example, the  filter  Resource-
                       Type  EQUALS  AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings
                       that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .

                     o To search for values that start with the filter  value,
                       use  PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PRE-
                       FIX AwsIam matches findings that have a  resource  type
                       that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type
                       of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would  all
                       match.
                        EQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined
                        by OR . A finding matches if it  matches  any  one  of
                        those filters.

                     To  search for values that do not contain the filter cri-
                     teria value, use one of the following  comparison  opera-
                     tors:

                     o To search for values that do not exactly match the fil-
                       ter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter Re-
                       sourceType  NOT_EQUALS  AwsIamPolicy  matches  findings
                       that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .

                     o To search for values that do not start with the  filter
                       value,  use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter
                       ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches  findings
                       that  have  a  resource  type  that does not start with
                       AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy
                       , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from
                       the results.
                        NOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on  the  same
                        field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it
                        matches all of those filters.

                     For filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an
                     EQUALS  filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS fil-
                     ter. Combining filters in this way always returns an  er-
                     ror,  even  if  the  provided  filter values would return
                     valid results.

                     You can combine PREFIX filters with  NOT_EQUALS  or  PRE-
                     FIX_NOT_EQUALS  filters  for the same field. Security Hub
                     first processes the PREFIX filters, then  the  NOT_EQUALS
                     or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.

                     For example, for the following filter, Security Hub first
                     identifies findings that have resource types  that  start
                     with  either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings
                     that have a resource type of  AwsIamPolicy  and  findings
                     that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam

                     o ResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2

                     findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as
                     the filter text, then there is no match.

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying

              (structure)
                 A string filter for querying findings.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The  string  filter  value. Filter values are case sensi-

                 Comparison -> (string)
                     The condition to apply to a string  value  when  querying

       --group-by-attribute (string)
          The updated GroupBy attribute that defines this insight.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1: To change the filter for a custom insight

       The  following  update-insight example changes the filters for a custom
       insight. The updated insight looks for findings with  a  high  severity
       that are related to AWS roles.

          aws securityhub update-insight \
              --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --filters '{"ResourceType": [{ "Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "AwsIamRole"}], "SeverityLabel": [{"Comparison": "EQUALS", "Value": "HIGH"}]}' \
              --name "High severity role findings"

       Example 2: To change the grouping attribute for a custom insight

       The following update-insight example changes the grouping attribute for
       the custom insight with the specified ARN. The new  grouping  attribute
       is the resource ID.

          aws securityhub update-insight \
              --insight-arn "arn:aws:securityhub:us-west-1:123456789012:insight/123456789012/custom/a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" \
              --group-by-attribute "ResourceId" \
              --name "Critical role findings"

       Output:
