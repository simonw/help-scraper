DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()                              DESCRIBE-SUBNET-GROUPS()



NAME
       describe-subnet-groups -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  a list of subnet group descriptions. If a subnet group name is
       specified, the list contains only the description of that group.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-subnet-groups
          [--subnet-group-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --subnet-group-name (string)
          The name of the subnet group to return details for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       SubnetGroups -> (list)
          A list of subnet groups. Each element in the list contains  detailed
          information about one group.

          (structure)
              Represents the output of one of the following operations:

              o CreateSubnetGroup

              o UpdateSubnetGroup

              A  subnet  group  is a collection of subnets (typically private)
              that you can designate for your clusters running  in  an  Amazon
              Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the subnet group

              Description -> (string)
                 A description of the subnet group

              VpcId -> (string)
                 The  Amazon  Virtual Private Cloud identifier (VPC ID) of the
                 subnet group.

              Subnets -> (list)
                 A list of subnets associated with the subnet group.

                 (structure)
                     Represents the subnet associated with a cluster. This pa-
                     rameter  refers to subnets defined in Amazon Virtual Pri-
                     vate Cloud (Amazon VPC) and used with MemoryDB.

                     Identifier -> (string)
                        The unique identifier for the subnet.

                     AvailabilityZone -> (structure)
                        The Availability Zone where the subnet resides

                        Name -> (string)
                            The name of the Availability Zone.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the subnet group.
