SYNOPSIS
            create-acl
          --acl-name <value>
          [--user-names <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the Access Control List.

       --user-names (list)
          The list of users that belong to the Access Control List.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          A list of tags to be added to this resource. A tag  is  a  key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A tag that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags  are  com-
              posed  of  a  Key/Value pair. You can use tags to categorize and
              track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or  remove  tags
              on  clusters,  those  actions will be replicated to all nodes in
              the cluster. A tag with a null Value is permitted. For more  in-
              formation, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
