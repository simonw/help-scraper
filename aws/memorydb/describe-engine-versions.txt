DESCRIBE-ENGINE-VERSIONS()                          DESCRIBE-ENGINE-VERSIONS()



NAME
       describe-engine-versions -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of the available Redis engine versions.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-engine-versions
          [--engine-version <value>]
          [--parameter-group-family <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--default-only | --no-default-only]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --engine-version (string)
          The Redis engine version

       --parameter-group-family (string)
          The name of a specific parameter group family to return details for.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --default-only | --no-default-only (boolean)
          If true, specifies that only the default version  of  the  specified
          engine or engine and major version combination is to be returned.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To return a list of engine versions

       The  following  describe-engine-versions` returns a list of engine ver-
       sions.

          aws memorydb describe-engine-versions

       Output:

          {
              "EngineVersions": [
                  {
                      "EngineVersion": "6.2",
                      "EnginePatchVersion": "6.2.6",
                      "ParameterGroupFamily": "memorydb_redis6"
                  }
              ]
          }

       For more information, see Engine versions and upgrading in the MemoryDB
       User Guide.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       EngineVersions -> (list)
          A  list of engine version details. Each element in the list contains
          detailed information about one engine version.

          (structure)
              Provides details of the Redis engine version

              EngineVersion -> (string)
                 The engine version

              EnginePatchVersion -> (string)
                 The patched engine version

              ParameterGroupFamily -> (string)
                 Specifies the name of the parameter group family to which the
                 engine default parameters apply.
