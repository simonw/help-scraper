DESCRIBE-ACLS()                                                DESCRIBE-ACLS()



NAME
       describe-acls -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of ACLs

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-acls
          [--acl-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the ACL

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       ACLs -> (list)
          The list of ACLs

          (structure)
              An Access Control List. You can authenticate users  with  Access
              Contol  Lists.  ACLs  enable  you  to  control cluster access by
              grouping users. These Access control lists are designed as a way
              to organize access to clusters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the Access Control List

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates  ACL  status. Can be "creating", "active", "modify-
                 ing", "deleting".

              UserNames -> (list)
                 The list of user names that belong to the ACL.

                 (string)

              MinimumEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The minimum engine version supported for the ACL

              PendingChanges -> (structure)
                 A list of updates being applied to the ACL.

                 UserNamesToRemove -> (list)
                     A list of user names being removed from the ACL

                     (string)

                 UserNamesToAdd -> (list)
                     A list of users being added to the ACL

                     (string)

              Clusters -> (list)
                 A list of clusters associated with the ACL.

                 (string)

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the ACL

       NextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged.
