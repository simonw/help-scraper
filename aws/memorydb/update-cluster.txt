OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to update

       --description (string)
          The description of the cluster to update

       --security-group-ids (list)
          The SecurityGroupIds to update

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --maintenance-window (string)
          The maintenance window to update

       --sns-topic-arn (string)
          The SNS topic ARN to update

       --sns-topic-status (string)
          The  status  of the Amazon SNS notification topic. Notifications are
          sent only if the status is active.

       --parameter-group-name (string)
          The name of the parameter group to update

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins taking  a
          daily snapshot of your cluster.

       --snapshot-retention-limit (integer)
          The  number  of  days  for  which MemoryDB retains automatic cluster
          snapshots before deleting them. For example, if you set  SnapshotRe-
          tentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today is retained for 5
          days before being deleted.

       --node-type (string)
          A valid node type that you want to scale this cluster up or down to.

       --engine-version (string)
          The upgraded version of the engine to be run on the nodes.  You  can
          upgrade  to  a  newer engine version, but you cannot downgrade to an
          earlier engine version. If you want to use an  earlier  engine  ver-
          sion,  you  must delete the existing cluster and create it anew with
          the earlier engine version.

       --replica-configuration (structure)
          The number of replicas that will reside in each shard

          ReplicaCount -> (integer)
              The number of replicas to scale up or down to

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ReplicaCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ReplicaCount": integer
          }

       --shard-configuration (structure)
          The number of shards in the cluster

          ShardCount -> (integer)
              The number of shards in the cluster

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ShardCount=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "ShardCount": integer
          }

       --acl-name (string)
          The Access Control List that is associated with the cluster

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       The following update-cluster`` updates the parameter group of a cluster
       to my-parameter-group.

          MaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on  the
              cluster  is  performed. It is specified as a range in the format
              ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance
              window is a 60 minute period.

              The  daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins tak-
              ing a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If  you
              do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an
              appropriate time range.

          ACLName -> (string)
