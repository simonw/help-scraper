DELETE-CLUSTER()                                              DELETE-CLUSTER()



NAME
       delete-cluster -

DESCRIPTION
       Deletes  a  cluster. It also deletes all associated nodes and node end-
       points

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            delete-cluster
          --cluster-name <value>
          [--final-snapshot-name <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster to be deleted

       --final-snapshot-name (string)
          The user-supplied name of a final  cluster  snapshot.  This  is  the
          unique name that identifies the snapshot. MemoryDB creates the snap-
          shot, and then deletes the cluster immediately afterward.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

              window is a 60 minute period.

              The daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins  tak-
              ing  a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If you
              do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an
              appropriate time range.
