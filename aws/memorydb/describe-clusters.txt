DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()                                        DESCRIBE-CLUSTERS()



NAME
       describe-clusters -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about all provisioned clusters if no cluster iden-
       tifier is specified, or about a specific cluster if a cluster  name  is
       supplied.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-clusters
          [--cluster-name <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--show-shard-details | --no-show-shard-details]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The name of the cluster

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --show-shard-details | --no-show-shard-details (boolean)
          An optional flag that can be included in the request to retrieve in-
          formation about the individual shard(s).

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT

          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

                 shots before deleting them. For example,  if  you  set  Snap-
                 shotRetentionLimit  to  5, a snapshot that was taken today is
                 retained for 5 days before being deleted.
