FAILOVER-SHARD()                                              FAILOVER-SHARD()



NAME
       failover-shard -

DESCRIPTION
       Used to failover a shard

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            failover-shard
          --cluster-name <value>
          --shard-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          The cluster being failed over

       --shard-name (string)
          The name of the shard

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To fail over a shard

       The following failover-shard` fails over a shard.

          aws memorydb failover-shard \
              --cluster-name my-cluster --shard-name 0001

              shots before deleting them. For example, if you set  SnapshotRe-

              for 5 days before being deleted.

          MaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies the weekly time range during which maintenance on  the
              cluster  is  performed. It is specified as a range in the format
              ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance
              window is a 60 minute period.

          SnapshotWindow -> (string)
              The  daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins tak-
              ing a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If  you
              do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an
              appropriate time range.

          ACLName -> (string)
              The name of the Access Control List associated with  this  clus-
