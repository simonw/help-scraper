DESCRIBE-EVENTS()                                            DESCRIBE-EVENTS()



NAME
       describe-events -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  events  related  to  clusters,  security groups, and parameter
       groups. You can obtain events specific to a particular  cluster,  secu-
       rity group, or parameter group by providing the name as a parameter. By
       default, only the events occurring within the last hour  are  returned;
       however, you can retrieve up to 14 days' worth of events if necessary.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-events
          [--source-name <value>]
          [--source-type <value>]
          [--start-time <value>]
          [--end-time <value>]
          [--duration <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-name (string)
          The identifier of the event source for which events are returned. If
          not specified, all sources are included in the response.

       --source-type (string)
          The event source to retrieve events for. If no value  is  specified,
          all events are returned.

          Possible values:

          o node

          o parameter-group

          o subnet-group

          o cluster

          o user

          o acl

       --start-time (timestamp)
          The beginning of the time interval to retrieve events for, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --end-time (timestamp)
          The end of the time interval for which to retrieve events, specified
          in ISO 8601 format. Example: 2017-03-30T07:03:49.555Z

       --duration (integer)
          The number of minutes worth of events to retrieve.

       --max-results (integer)
          The  maximum  number  of records to include in the response. If more
          records exist than the specified MaxResults value, a  token  is  in-
          cluded  in  the  response  so  that the remaining results can be re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       Events -> (list)
          A list of events. Each element in the list contains detailed  infor-
          mation about one event.

          (structure)
              Represents  a  single occurrence of something interesting within
              the system. Some examples of events are creating  a  cluster  or
              adding or removing a node.

              SourceName -> (string)
                 The  name  for  the  source of the event. For example, if the
                 event occurred at the cluster level, the identifier would  be
                 the name of the cluster.

              SourceType -> (string)
                 Specifies  the  origin of this event - a cluster, a parameter
                 group, a security group, etc.

              Message -> (string)
                 The text of the event.

              Date -> (timestamp)
                 The date and time when the event occurred.
