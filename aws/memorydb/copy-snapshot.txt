       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            copy-snapshot
          --source-snapshot-name <value>
          --target-snapshot-name <value>
          [--target-bucket <value>]
          [--kms-key-id <value>]
          [--tags <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --source-snapshot-name (string)
          The name of an existing snapshot from which to make a copy.

       --target-snapshot-name (string)
          A name for the snapshot copy. MemoryDB does not permit overwriting a
          snapshot, therefore this name must be unique within  its  context  -
          MemoryDB or an Amazon S3 bucket if exporting.

       --target-bucket (string)
          The Amazon S3 bucket to which the snapshot is exported. This parame-
          ter is used only when exporting a snapshot for external access. When
          using  this parameter to export a snapshot, be sure MemoryDB has the
          needed permissions to this S3 bucket. For more information, see Step
          2: Grant MemoryDB Access to Your Amazon S3 Bucket .

       --kms-key-id (string)
          The ID of the KMS key used to encrypt the target snapshot.

       --tags (list)
          A  list  of  tags to be added to this resource. A tag is a key-value
          pair. A tag key must be accompanied by a tag value, although null is
          accepted.

          (structure)
              A  tag  that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags are com-
              posed of a Key/Value pair. You can use tags  to  categorize  and
              track  all  your MemoryDB resources. When you add or remove tags
              on clusters, those actions will be replicated to  all  nodes  in
              the  cluster. A tag with a null Value is permitted. For more in-
              formation, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)
                 The key for the tag. May not be null.

              Value -> (string)
                 The tag's value. May be null.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
