NAME
       describe-snapshots -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about cluster snapshots. By default, DescribeSnap-
       shots lists all of your snapshots; it can optionally describe a  single
       snapshot, or just the snapshots associated with a particular cluster.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-snapshots
          [--cluster-name <value>]
          [--snapshot-name <value>]
          [--source <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--show-detail | --no-show-detail]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cluster-name (string)
          A  user-supplied cluster identifier. If this parameter is specified,
          only snapshots associated with that specific cluster are described.

       --snapshot-name (string)
          A user-supplied name of the snapshot. If this  parameter  is  speci-
          fied, only this named snapshot is described.

       --source (string)
          If set to system, the output shows snapshots that were automatically
          created by MemoryDB. If set to user the output shows snapshots  that
          were  manually  created. If omitted, the output shows both automati-
          cally and manually created snapshots.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds  the  value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned, there are
          more results available. The value of nextToken is a  unique  pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --show-detail | --no-show-detail (boolean)
          A  Boolean  value which if true, the shard configuration is included
          in the snapshot description.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.
