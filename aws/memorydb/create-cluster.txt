              A tag that can be added to an MemoryDB resource. Tags  are  com-
              posed  of  a  Key/Value pair. You can use tags to categorize and
              track all your MemoryDB resources. When you add or  remove  tags
              on  clusters,  those  actions will be replicated to all nodes in
              the cluster. A tag with a null Value is permitted. For more  in-
              formation, see Tagging your MemoryDB resources

              Key -> (string)

       --snapshot-window (string)
          The  daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins taking a
          daily snapshot of your shard.

          Example: 05:00-09:00

          If you do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses
          an appropriate time range.

       --acl-name (string)
          The name of the Access Control List to associate with the cluster.

       --engine-version (string)
          The version number of the Redis engine to be used for the cluster.

          gine version upgrades after launch.

       --data-tiering | --no-data-tiering (boolean)
          Enables  data  tiering.  Data tiering is only supported for clusters
          using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be set when using r6gd
          nodes. For more information, see Data tiering .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              The number of days for which MemoryDB  retains  automatic  snap-
              shots  before deleting them. For example, if you set SnapshotRe-
              tentionLimit to 5, a snapshot that was taken today  is  retained
              for 5 days before being deleted.

          MaintenanceWindow -> (string)
              Specifies  the weekly time range during which maintenance on the
              cluster is performed. It is specified as a range in  the  format
              ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi (24H Clock UTC). The minimum maintenance
              window is a 60 minute period.

          SnapshotWindow -> (string)
              The daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins  tak-
              ing  a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: 05:00-09:00 If you
              do not specify this parameter, MemoryDB automatically chooses an
              appropriate time range.

          ACLName -> (string)
              The  name  of the Access Control List associated with this clus-
              ter.

          AutoMinorVersionUpgrade -> (boolean)
              When set to true, the cluster will automatically  receive  minor
              engine version upgrades after launch.

          DataTiering -> (string)
              Enables  data  tiering. Data tiering is only supported for clus-
              ters using the r6gd node type. This parameter must be  set  when
              using r6gd nodes. For more information, see Data tiering .
