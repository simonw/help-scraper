NAME
       describe-users -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns a list of users.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-users
          [--user-name <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --user-name (string)
          The name of the user

       --filters (list)
          Filter to determine the list of users to return.

          (structure)
              Used to streamline results of a search based on the property be-
              ing filtered.

              Name -> (string)
                 The property being filtered. For example, UserName.

              Values -> (list)
                 The property values to filter on. For example, "user-123".

                 (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string,string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "string",
              "Values": ["string", ...]
            }
            ...
          ]

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of records to include in the  response.  If  more
          records  exist  than  the specified MaxResults value, a token is in-
          cluded in the response so that the  remaining  results  can  be  re-
          trieved.

       --next-token (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

OUTPUT
       Users -> (list)
          A list of users.

          (structure)
              You create users and assign them specific permissions  by  using
              an  access  string. You assign the users to Access Control Lists
              aligned with a specific role (administrators,  human  resources)
              that are then deployed to one or more MemoryDB clusters.

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the user

              Status -> (string)
                 Indicates  the  user  status. Can be "active", "modifying" or
                 "deleting".

              AccessString -> (string)
                 Access permissions string used for this user.

              ACLNames -> (list)
                 The names of the Access Control Lists to which the  user  be-
                 longs

                 (string)

              MinimumEngineVersion -> (string)
                 The minimum engine version supported for the user

              Authentication -> (structure)
                 Denotes whether the user requires a password to authenticate.

                 Type -> (string)
                     Indicates whether the user requires a password to authen-
                     ticate.

                 PasswordCount -> (integer)
                     The number of passwords belonging to the user. The  maxi-
                     mum is two.

              ARN -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the user.

       NextToken -> (string)
          An optional argument to pass in case the total number of records ex-
          ceeds the value of MaxResults. If nextToken is returned,  there  are
          more  results  available. The value of nextToken is a unique pagina-
          tion token for each page. Make the call again using the returned to-
          ken to retrieve the next page. Keep all other arguments unchanged.
