LIST-ACTIVITIES()                                            LIST-ACTIVITIES()



NAME
       list-activities -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the existing activities.

       If  nextToken  is returned, there are more results available. The value
       of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the  call
       again  using  the  returned  token  to retrieve the next page. Keep all
       other arguments unchanged.  Each  pagination  token  expires  after  24
       hours.  Using  an  expired pagination token will return an HTTP 400 In-
       validToken error.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       list-activities is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: activities

SYNOPSIS
            list-activities
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       activities -> (list)
          The list of activities.

          (structure)
              Contains details about an activity.

              activityArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the activity.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the activity.

                 A name must not contain:

                 o white space

                 o brackets < > { } [ ]

                 o wildcard characters ? *

                 o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

                 o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

                 To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should  only
                 contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

              creationDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the activity is created.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If  nextToken  is  returned,  there  are more results available. The
          value of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page.  Make
          the  call  again using the returned token to retrieve the next page.
          Keep all other arguments unchanged. Each  pagination  token  expires
          after  24  hours.  Using  an expired pagination token will return an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
