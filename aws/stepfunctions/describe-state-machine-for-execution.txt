NAME
       describe-state-machine-for-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Describes the state machine associated with a specific execution.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-state-machine-for-execution
          --execution-arn <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --execution-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the execution you want  state  ma-
          chine information for.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine associated  with
          the execution.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the state machine associated with the execution.

       definition -> (string)
          The  Amazon  States  Language  definition  of the state machine. See
          Amazon States Language .

       roleArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role of the State  Machine
          for the execution.

       updateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the state machine associated with an execution was
          updated. For a newly created state machine,  this  is  the  creation
          date.

       loggingConfiguration -> (structure)
          The  LoggingConfiguration  data  type is used to set CloudWatch Logs
          options.

          level -> (string)
              Defines which category of execution history events are logged.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines whether execution data is included in your log.  When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An  array of objects that describes where your execution history
              events will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your  log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch log group. For more in-
                     formation, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudForma-
                     tion User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of the the CloudWatch log group to which you
                        want your logs emitted to. The ARN must end with :*

       tracingConfiguration -> (structure)
          Selects whether AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              When set to true , AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.
