UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()                                  UPDATE-STATE-MACHINE()



NAME
       update-state-machine -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates an existing state machine by modifying its definition , roleArn
       , or loggingConfiguration . Running executions will continue to use the
       previous definition and roleArn . You must include at least one of def-
       inition or roleArn or you will receive a  MissingRequiredParameter  er-
       ror.

       NOTE:
          All  StartExecution  calls within a few seconds will use the updated
          definition and roleArn . Executions started immediately after  call-
          ing UpdateStateMachine may use the previous state machine definition
          and roleArn .

SYNOPSIS
            update-state-machine
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--definition <value>]
          [--role-arn <value>]
          [--logging-configuration <value>]
          [--tracing-configuration <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine.

       --definition (string)
          The Amazon States Language definition  of  the  state  machine.  See
          Amazon States Language .

       --role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role of the state machine.

       --logging-configuration (structure)
          The  LoggingConfiguration  data  type is used to set CloudWatch Logs
          options.

          level -> (string)
              Defines which category of execution history events are logged.

          includeExecutionData -> (boolean)
              Determines whether execution data is included in your log.  When
              set to false , data is excluded.

          destinations -> (list)
              An  array of objects that describes where your execution history
              events will be logged. Limited to size 1. Required, if your  log
              level is not set to OFF .

              (structure)
                 cloudWatchLogsLogGroup -> (structure)
                     An object describing a CloudWatch log group. For more in-
                     formation, see AWS::Logs::LogGroup in the AWS CloudForma-
                     tion User Guide.

                     logGroupArn -> (string)
                        The  ARN  of the the CloudWatch log group to which you
                        want your logs emitted to. The ARN must end with :*

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "level": "ALL"|"ERROR"|"FATAL"|"OFF",
            "includeExecutionData": true|false,
            "destinations": [
              {
                "cloudWatchLogsLogGroup": {
                  "logGroupArn": "string"
                }
              }
              ...
            ]
          }

       --tracing-configuration (structure)
          Selects whether AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

          enabled -> (boolean)
              When set to true , AWS X-Ray tracing is enabled.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          enabled=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "enabled": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       updateDate -> (timestamp)
          The date and time the state machine was updated.
