LIST-EXECUTIONS()                                            LIST-EXECUTIONS()



NAME
       list-executions -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the executions of a state machine that meet the filtering crite-
       ria. Results are sorted by time, with the most recent execution first.

       If nextToken is returned, there are more results available.  The  value
       of  nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make the call
       again using the returned token to retrieve  the  next  page.  Keep  all
       other  arguments  unchanged.  Each  pagination  token  expires after 24
       hours. Using an expired pagination token will return an  HTTP  400  In-
       validToken error.

       NOTE:
          This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort
          and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.

       This API action is not supported by EXPRESS state machines.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-executions is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: executions

SYNOPSIS
            list-executions
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--status-filter <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine whose executions
          is listed.

       --status-filter (string)
          If specified, only list the executions whose current execution  sta-
          tus matches the given filter.

          Possible values:

          o RUNNING

          o SUCCEEDED

          o FAILED

          o TIMED_OUT

          o ABORTED

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       executions -> (list)
          The list of matching executions.

          (structure)
              Contains details about an execution.

              executionArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the execution.

              stateMachineArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the executed state machine.

              name -> (string)
                 The name of the execution.

                 A name must not contain:

                 o white space

                 o brackets < > { } [ ]

                 o wildcard characters ? *

                 o special characters " # % \ ^ | ~ ` $ & , ; : /

                 o control characters (U+0000-001F , U+007F-009F )

                 To enable logging with CloudWatch Logs, the name should  only
                 contain 0-9, A-Z, a-z, - and _.

              status -> (string)
                 The current status of the execution.

              startDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date the execution started.

              stopDate -> (timestamp)
                 If  the  execution  already  ended,  the  date  the execution
                 stopped.

       nextToken -> (string)
          If nextToken is returned, there  are  more  results  available.  The
          value  of nextToken is a unique pagination token for each page. Make
          the call again using the returned token to retrieve the  next  page.
          Keep  all  other  arguments unchanged. Each pagination token expires
          after 24 hours. Using an expired pagination  token  will  return  an
          HTTP 400 InvalidToken error.
