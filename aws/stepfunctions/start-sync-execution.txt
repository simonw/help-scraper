NAME
       start-sync-execution -

DESCRIPTION
       Starts a Synchronous Express state machine execution.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            start-sync-execution
          --state-machine-arn <value>
          [--name <value>]
          [--input <value>]
          [--trace-header <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --state-machine-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the state machine to execute.

       --name (string)
          The name of the execution.

       --input (string)
          The  string that contains the JSON input data for the execution, for
          example:
              "input": "{\"first_name\" : \"test\"}"

          NOTE:
              If you don't include any JSON input data, you still must include
              the two braces, for example: "input": "{}"

          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       --trace-header (string)
          Passes the AWS X-Ray trace header. The  trace  header  can  also  be
          passed in the request payload.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       stateMachineArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that identifies the state machine.

       name -> (string)
          The name of the execution.

       startDate -> (timestamp)
          The date the execution is started.

       stopDate -> (timestamp)
          If the execution has already ended, the date the execution stopped.

       status -> (string)
          The current status of the execution.

       error -> (string)
          The error code of the failure.

       cause -> (string)
          A more detailed explanation of the cause of the failure.

       input -> (string)
          The string that contains the  JSON  input  data  of  the  execution.
          Length  constraints  apply to the payload size, and are expressed as
          bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

       inputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates whether input or output was included in the  response.
              Always true for API calls.

       output -> (string)
          The  JSON  output data of the execution. Length constraints apply to
          the payload size, and are expressed as bytes in UTF-8 encoding.

          NOTE:
              This field is set only if the execution succeeds. If the  execu-
              tion fails, this field is null.

       outputDetails -> (structure)
          Provides details about execution input or output.

          included -> (boolean)
              Indicates  whether input or output was included in the response.
              Always true for API calls.

       traceHeader -> (string)
          The AWS X-Ray trace header that was passed to the execution.

       billingDetails -> (structure)
          An object that describes workflow billing details, including  billed
          duration and memory use.

          billedMemoryUsedInMB -> (long)
              Billed memory consumption of your workflow, in MB.

          billedDurationInMilliseconds -> (long)
              Billed duration of your workflow, in milliseconds.
