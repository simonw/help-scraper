LIST-PLACEMENTS()                                            LIST-PLACEMENTS()



NAME
       list-placements -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists the placement(s) of a project.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-placements is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can  dis-
       able  pagination  by  providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: placements

SYNOPSIS
            list-placements
          --project-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --project-name (string)
          The project containing the placements to be listed.

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list all AWS IoT 1-Click placements for a project

       The following list-placements example lists all AWS IoT 1-Click  place-
       ments for the specified project.

          aws iot1click-projects list-placements \
              --project-name AnytownDumpsters

       Output:

          {
              "placements": [
                  {
                      "projectName": "AnytownDumpsters",
                      "placementName": "customer217",
                      "createdDate": 1563488454,
                      "updatedDate": 1563488454
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       placements -> (list)
          An object listing the requested placements.

          (structure)
              An object providing summary information for a particular  place-
              ment.

              projectName -> (string)
                 The name of the project containing the placement.

              placementName -> (string)
                 The name of the placement being summarized.

              createdDate -> (timestamp)
                 The  date  when the placement was originally created, in UNIX
                 epoch time format.

              updatedDate -> (timestamp)
                 The date when the placement was last updated, in  UNIX  epoch
                 time  format. If the placement was not updated, then created-
                 Date and updatedDate are the same.

       nextToken -> (string)
          The token used to retrieve the next set of results - will be  effec-
          tively empty if there are no further results.
