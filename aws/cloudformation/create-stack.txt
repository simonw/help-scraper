CREATE-STACK()                                                  CREATE-STACK()



NAME
       create-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes
       successfully, the stack creation starts. You can check  the  status  of
       the stack via the  DescribeStacks API.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name that is associated with the stack. The name must be unique
          in the Region in which you are creating the stack.

          NOTE:
              A stack name can contain only alphanumeric characters (case sen-
              sitive)  and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical charac-
              ter and cannot be longer than 128 characters.

       --template-body (string)
          Structure containing the template body with a minimum  length  of  1
          byte  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more information, go
          to Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --template-url (string)
          Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to
          a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3
          bucket  or  a  Systems Manager document. For more information, go to
          the Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional: You must specify either the TemplateBody or the Templa-
          teURL parameter, but not both.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
          stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that is specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM pa-
                 rameter   key.   This  field  is  returned  only  for  `  SSM
                 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types`__
                 parameter types in the template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --disable-rollback | --no-disable-rollback (boolean)
          Set  to  true  to  disable  rollback  of the stack if stack creation
          failed. You can specify either DisableRollback or  OnFailure  ,  but
          not both.

          Default: false

       --rollback-configuration (structure)
          The  rollback  triggers  for  CloudFormation to monitor during stack
          creation and updating operations, and for the  specified  monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for  the  stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To  use  the  rollback  triggers previously specified for this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must  specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers you've specifed before (for example,  when  creating  the
                stack  or  during  a previous stack update). Any triggers that
                you don't include in the  updated  list  of  triggers  are  no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To  remove  all currently specified triggers, specify an empty
                list for this parameter.

              If a specified trigger is missing, the  entire  stack  operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A  rollback  trigger  CloudFormation monitors during creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm or AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The amount of time,  in  minutes,  during  which  CloudFormation
              should  monitor  all  the rollback triggers after the stack cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any  roll-
              back  triggers,  CloudFormation still waits the specified period
              of time before cleaning up old  resources  after  update  opera-
              tions.  You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

              If  you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still moni-
              tors the specified rollback triggers during stack  creation  and
              update  operations.  Then, for update operations, it begins dis-
              posing of old resources  immediately  once  the  operation  com-
              pletes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RollbackTriggers=[{Arn=string,Type=string},{Arn=string,Type=string}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RollbackTriggers": [
              {
                "Arn": "string",
                "Type": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "MonitoringTimeInMinutes": integer
          }

       --timeout-in-minutes (integer)
          The  amount  of  time  that can pass before the stack status becomes
          CREATE_FAILED; if DisableRollback is not set or is set  to  false  ,
          the stack will be rolled back.

       --notification-arns (list)
          The  Simple  Notification  Service (SNS) topic ARNs to publish stack
          related events. You can find your SNS topic ARNs using the SNS  con-
          sole or your Command Line Interface (CLI).

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --capabilities (list)
          In  some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack tem-
          plate contains certain capabilities in order for  CloudFormation  to
          create the stack.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM  and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web  Services  account;  for example, by creating new Identity and
            Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must  explic-
            itly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
            following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABIL-
            ITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If  you  have  IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If you don't specify either of these  capabilities,  CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If  your  stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
          you review all permissions associated with them and edit their  per-
          missions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some template contain macros. Macros per-
            form  custom  processing on templates; this can include simple ac-
            tions like find-and-replace operations, all the way  to  extensive
            transformations  of entire templates. Because of this, users typi-
            cally create a change set from the  processed  template,  so  that
            they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actu-
            ally creating the stack. If your stack template  contains  one  or
            more  macros,  and  you choose to create a stack directly from the
            processed template, without first reviewing the resulting  changes
            in  a  change  set, you must acknowledge this capability. This in-
            cludes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which  are
            macros  hosted  by  CloudFormation.  If you want to create a stack
            from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks,  you
            must  create the stack directly from the template using this capa-
            bility.

          WARNING:
                 You should only create stacks directly from a stack  template
                 that  contains  macros  if you know what processing the macro
                 performs. Each macro relies on an underlying  Lambda  service
                 function  for  processing  stack templates. Be aware that the
                 Lambda function owner can update the function operation with-
                 out CloudFormation being notified.

              For more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform
              Custom Processing on Templates .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --resource-types (list)
          The template resource types that you have permissions to  work  with
          for   this   create  stack  action,  such  as  AWS::EC2::Instance  ,
          AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance . Use the following syntax
          to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all Amazon Web Ser-
          vices  resources),  Custom::*  (for  all  custom  resources),   Cus-
          tom::*logical_ID*  `` (for a specific custom resource), ``AWS::*ser-
          vice_name* ::* (for all resources of a particular  Amazon  Web  Ser-
          vices service), and
          ``
          AWS::service_name  ::resource_logical_ID  ``  (for a specific Amazon
          Web Services resource).

          If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're
          creating,  the  stack  creation  fails.  By  default, CloudFormation
          grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and  Access  Man-
          agement (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condi-
          tion keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Ac-
          cess with Identity and Access Management .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to create the  stack.  Cloud-
          Formation  uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
          CloudFormation always uses this role for all  future  operations  on
          the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack,
          CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don't  have  permis-
          sion to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

          If  you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
          previously associated with the  stack.  If  no  role  is  available,
          CloudFormation  uses a temporary session that is generated from your
          user credentials.

       --on-failure (string)
          Determines what action will be taken if stack creation  fails.  This
          must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify ei-
          ther OnFailure or DisableRollback , but not both.

          Default: ROLLBACK

          Possible values:

          o DO_NOTHING

          o ROLLBACK

          o DELETE

       --stack-policy-body (string)
          Structure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go
          to  Prevent  Updates  to  Stack Resources in the CloudFormation User
          Guide . You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPoli-
          cyURL parameter, but not both.

       --stack-policy-url (string)
          Location  of  a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point
          to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an  S3  bucket  in  the
          same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody
          or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs to associate with this  stack.  CloudFormation  also
          propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maxi-
          mum number of 50 tags can be specified.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token
          if you plan to retry requests  so  that  CloudFormation  knows  that
          you're  not  attempting  to  create  a stack with the same name. You
          might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation  suc-
          cessfully received them.

          All  events  triggered  by  a given stack operation are assigned the
          same client request token, which you can use  to  track  operations.
          For  example,  if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token
          token1 , then all the StackEvents generated by that  operation  will
          have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

          In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
          the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
          use  the  token  format  Console-StackOperation-ID , which helps you
          easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you  create  a
          stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
          token     in     the     following     format:      Console-CreateS-
          tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       --enable-termination-protection   |  --no-enable-termination-protection
       (boolean)
          Whether to enable termination protection on the specified stack.  If
          a  user  attempts  to delete a stack with termination protection en-
          abled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more
          information, see Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted in the Cloud-
          Formation User Guide . Termination protection is disabled on  stacks
          by default.

          For  nested stacks , termination protection is set on the root stack
          and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To create an AWS CloudFormation stack

       The following create-stacks command  creates  a  stack  with  the  name
       myteststack using the sampletemplate.json template:

          aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name myteststack --template-body file://sampletemplate.json --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=TestKey ParameterKey=SubnetIDs,ParameterValue=SubnetID1\\,SubnetID2

       Output:

          {
