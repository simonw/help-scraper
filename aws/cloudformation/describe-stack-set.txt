OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set whose description you want.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

              users and groups can include in their stack sets.

          StackSetDriftDetectionDetails -> (structure)
              Detailed information about the drift status of the stack set.

              For  stack  sets,  contains information about the last completed
              drift operation performed on the stack  set.  Information  about
              drift operations currently in progress isn't included.

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  stack set's actual configuration compared to
                 its expected template and parameter  configuration.  A  stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances have drifted from their expected template  and  pa-
                 rameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED  :  One or more of the stack instances belonging to
                   the stack set stack differs from the expected template  and
                   parameter  configuration. A stack instance is considered to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation hasn't checked the stack set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set  stack  match  from the expected template and parameter
                   configuration.

              DriftDetectionStatus -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set drift detection operation.

                 o COMPLETED : The drift detection operation completed without
                   failing on any stack instances.

                 o FAILED  : The drift detection operation exceeded the speci-
                   fied failure tolerance.

                 o PARTIAL_SUCCESS : The drift detection  operation  completed
                   without exceeding the failure tolerance for the operation.

                 o IN_PROGRESS  :  The  drift detection operation is currently
                   being performed.

                 o STOPPED : The user has canceled the drift detection  opera-
                   tion.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL  for
                 any  stack  set on which drift detection hasn't yet been per-
                 formed.

              TotalStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The total number of stack instances belonging to  this  stack
                 set.

                 The total number of stack instances is equal to the total of:

                 o Stack instances that match the stack set configuration.

                 o Stack  instances  that have drifted from the stack set con-
                   figuration.

                 o Stack instances where the  drift  detection  operation  has
                   failed.

                 o Stack instances currently being checked for drift.

              DriftedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number of stack instances that have drifted from the ex-
                 pected template and parameter configuration of the stack set.
                 A stack instance is considered to have drifted if one or more
                 of the resources in the associated stack  don't  match  their
                 expected configuration.

              InSyncStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of stack instances which match the expected tem-
                 plate and parameter configuration of the stack set.

              InProgressStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The number  of  stack  instances  that  are  currently  being
                 checked for drift.

              FailedStackInstancesCount -> (integer)
                 The  number  of stack instances for which the drift detection
                 operation failed.

          AutoDeployment -> (structure)
              [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets  auto-
              matically  deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to a
              target organization or organizational unit (OU).

              Enabled -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , StackSets automatically  deploys  additional
                 stack instances to Organizations accounts that are added to a
                 target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the speci-
                 fied  Regions. If an account is removed from a target organi-
                 zation or OU, StackSets deletes stack instances from the  ac-
                 count in the specified Regions.

              RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
                 If set to true , stack resources are retained when an account
                 is removed from a target organization or OU. If set to  false
                 , stack resources are deleted. Specify only if Enabled is set
                 to True .

          PermissionModel -> (string)
              Describes how the IAM roles required for  stack  set  operations
              are created.

              o With self-managed permissions, you must create the administra-
                tor and execution roles required to deploy to target accounts.
                For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permis-
                sions .

              o With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically cre-
                ates  the  IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by
                Organizations. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed
                Stack Set Permissions .

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              [Service-managed  permissions] The organization root ID or orga-
              nizational   unit   (OU)   IDs   that    you    specified    for
              DeploymentTargets .

              (string)

          ManagedExecution -> (structure)
              Describes  whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
              concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

              Active -> (boolean)
                 When true ,  StackSets  performs  non-conflicting  operations
                 concurrently  and  queues  conflicting operations. After con-
                 flicting operations finish, StackSets  starts  queued  opera-
                 tions in request order.

                 NOTE:
                     If there are already running or queued operations, Stack-
                     Sets queues all incoming  operations  even  if  they  are
                     non-conflicting.

                     You can't modify your stack set's execution configuration
                     while there are running or  queued  operations  for  that
                     stack set.

                 When  false  (default), StackSets performs one operation at a
                 time in request order.

          Regions -> (list)
              Returns a list of all Amazon  Web  Services  Regions  the  given
              StackSet  has  stack  instances deployed in. The Amazon Web Ser-
              vices Regions list output is in no particular order.
