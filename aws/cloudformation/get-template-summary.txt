GET-TEMPLATE-SUMMARY()                                  GET-TEMPLATE-SUMMARY()



NAME
       get-template-summary -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information about a new or existing template. The GetTemplate-
       Summary action is useful for viewing parameter information, such as de-
       fault parameter values and parameter types, before you create or update
       a stack or stack set.

       You can use the GetTemplateSummary action when you submit  a  template,
       or  you  can  get template information for a stack set, or a running or
       deleted stack.

       For deleted stacks, GetTemplateSummary returns the template information
       for  up  to  90  days after the stack has been deleted. If the template
       does not exist, a ValidationError is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-template-summary
          [--template-body <value>]
          [--template-url <value>]
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--stack-set-name <value>]
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --template-body (string)
          Structure containing the template body with a minimum  length  of  1
          byte  and  a  maximum  length  of 51,200 bytes. For more information
          about templates, see Template Anatomy  in  the  CloudFormation  User
          Guide.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          StackName , StackSetName , TemplateBody , or TemplateURL .

       --template-url (string)
          Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to
          a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that is located in an Amazon S3
          bucket or a Systems Manager document.  For  more  information  about
          templates, see Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          StackName , StackSetName , TemplateBody , or TemplateURL .

       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the stack ID that is associated with  the  stack,  which
          are  not always interchangeable. For running stacks, you can specify
          either the stack's name or its unique stack ID. For  deleted  stack,
          you must specify the unique stack ID.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          StackName , StackSetName , TemplateBody , or TemplateURL .

       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set from which the stack was cre-
          ated.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          StackName , StackSetName , TemplateBody , or TemplateURL .

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
