NAME
       describe-stack-drift-detection-status -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  a stack drift detection operation. A stack
       drift detection operation detects whether a stack's  actual  configura-
       tion differs, or has drifted , from it's expected configuration, as de-
       fined in the stack template and any values specified as template param-
       eters.  A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its re-
       sources have drifted. For more information on stack and resource drift,
       see Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources
       .

       Use  DetectStackDrift to initiate a stack  drift  detection  operation.
       DetectStackDrift returns a StackDriftDetectionId you can use to monitor
       the progress of the operation using DescribeStackDriftDetectionStatus .
       Once the drift detection operation has completed, use  DescribeStackRe-
       sourceDrifts to return drift information about the stack  and  its  re-
       sources.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-drift-detection-status
          --stack-drift-detection-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-drift-detection-id (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each time this operation is run. However, the number  of  drift  re-
          sults  CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for how long,
          may vary.

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To check a drift detection operation's status

       The following  describe-stack-drift-detection-status  example  displays
       the  status  of  a drift detection operation. Get the by ID running the
       detect-stack-drift command.

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-drift-detection-status \
              --stack-drift-detection-id 1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4

       Output:

          {
              "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204",
              "StackDriftDetectionId": "1a229160-e4d9-xmpl-ab67-0a4f93df83d4",
              "StackDriftStatus": "DRIFTED",
              "DetectionStatus": "DETECTION_COMPLETE",
              "DriftedStackResourceCount": 1,
              "Timestamp": "2019-10-02T05:54:30.902Z"
          }

OUTPUT
       StackId -> (string)
          The ID of the stack.

       StackDriftDetectionId -> (string)
          The ID of the drift detection results of this operation.

          CloudFormation generates new results, with a new drift detection ID,
          each  time  this  operation  is  run. However, the number of reports
          CloudFormation retains for any given stack, and for  how  long,  may
          vary.

       StackDriftStatus -> (string)
          Status  of the stack's actual configuration compared to its expected
          configuration.

          o DRIFTED : The stack differs from its expected template  configura-
            tion.  A stack is considered to have drifted if one or more of its
            resources have drifted.

          o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation has not checked if the stack  differs
            from its expected template configuration.

          o IN_SYNC  :  The  stack's actual configuration matches its expected
            template configuration.

          o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

       DetectionStatus -> (string)
          The status of the stack drift detection operation.

          o DETECTION_COMPLETE : The stack drift detection operation has  suc-
            cessfully  completed  for  all resources in the stack that support
            drift detection. (Resources that do not  currently  support  stack
            detection remain unchecked.) If you specified logical resource IDs
            for CloudFormation to use as a filter for the stack  drift  detec-
            tion  operation,  only  the  resources  with those logical IDs are
            checked for drift.

          o DETECTION_FAILED : The stack drift detection operation has  failed
            for  at least one resource in the stack. Results will be available
            for resources on which CloudFormation successfully completed drift
            detection.

          o DETECTION_IN_PROGRESS  :  The  stack  drift detection operation is
            currently in progress.

       DetectionStatusReason -> (string)
          The reason the stack drift detection operation has its current  sta-
          tus.

       DriftedStackResourceCount -> (integer)
          Total  number of stack resources that have drifted. This is NULL un-
          til the drift detection operation reaches a status of DETECTION_COM-
          PLETE  .  This  value  will  be  0  for stacks whose drift status is
          IN_SYNC .

       Timestamp -> (timestamp)
          Time at which the stack drift detection operation was initiated.
