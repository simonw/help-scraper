LIST-TYPES()                                                      LIST-TYPES()



NAME
       list-types -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about extension that have been registered
       with CloudFormation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-types is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may  be  issued
       in  order  to  retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable
       pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using  --out-
       put  text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query
       argument must extract data from the results of the following query  ex-
       pressions: TypeSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-types
          [--visibility <value>]
          [--provisioning-type <value>]
          [--deprecated-status <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--filters <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]

          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --visibility (string)
          The  scope  at which the extensions are visible and usable in Cloud-
          Formation operations.

          Valid values include:

          o PRIVATE : Extensions that are visible and usable within  this  ac-
            count and region. This includes:

            o Private  extensions  you have registered in this account and re-
              gion.

            o Public extensions that you have activated in  this  account  and
              region.

          o PUBLIC  : Extensions that are publicly visible and available to be
            activated within any Amazon account. This includes extensions from
            Amazon, as well as third-party publishers.

          The default is PRIVATE .

          Possible values:

          o PUBLIC

          o PRIVATE

       --provisioning-type (string)
          For  resource types, the provisioning behavior of the resource type.
          CloudFormation determines the provisioning type during registration,
          based on the types of handlers in the schema handler package submit-
          ted.

          Valid values include:

          o FULLY_MUTABLE : The resource type includes an  update  handler  to
            process updates to the type during stack update operations.

          o IMMUTABLE  : The resource type does not include an update handler,
            so the type cannot be updated and must instead be replaced  during
            stack update operations.

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE  :  The  resource  type does not include create,
            read, and delete handlers, and therefore cannot actually be provi-
            sioned.

          The default is FULLY_MUTABLE .

          Possible values:

          o NON_PROVISIONABLE

          o IMMUTABLE

          o FULLY_MUTABLE

       --deprecated-status (string)
          The deprecation status of the extension that you want to get summary
          information about.

          Valid values include:

          o LIVE : The extension is registered for use in CloudFormation oper-
            ations.

          o DEPRECATED : The extension has been deregistered and can no longer
            be used in CloudFormation operations.

          Possible values:

          o LIVE

          o DEPRECATED

       --type (string)
          The type of extension.

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --filters (structure)
          Filter criteria to use in determining which extensions to return.

          Filters must be compatible with Visibility to return valid  results.
          For example, specifying AWS_TYPES for Category and PRIVATE for Visi-
          bility returns an empty list of types,  but  specifying  PUBLIC  for
          Visibility returns the desired list.

          Category -> (string)
              The category of extensions to return.

              o REGISTERED  : Private extensions that have been registered for
                this account and region.

              o ACTIVATED : Public extensions that  have  been  activated  for
                this account and region.

              o THIRD_PARTY  :  Extensions  available  for use from publishers
                other than Amazon. This includes:

                o Private extensions registered in the account.

                o Public extensions from publishers other than Amazon, whether
                  activated or not.

              o AWS_TYPES : Extensions available for use from Amazon.

          PublisherId -> (string)
              The id of the publisher of the extension.

              Extensions  published by Amazon are not assigned a publisher ID.
              Use the AWS_TYPE category to specify a list of  types  published
              by Amazon.

          TypeNamePrefix -> (string)
              A prefix to use as a filter for results.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Category=string,PublisherId=string,TypeNamePrefix=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Category": "REGISTERED"|"ACTIVATED"|"THIRD_PARTY"|"AWS_TYPES",
            "PublisherId": "string",
            "TypeNamePrefix": "string"
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does  not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a smaller page size results in more calls to the  AWS  service,  re-
          trieving  fewer  items  in  each call. This can help prevent the AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The  total number of items to return in the command's output. If the
          total number of items available is more than the value specified,  a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent  command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       TypeSummaries -> (list)
          A  list of TypeSummary structures that contain information about the
          specified extensions.

          (structure)
              Contains summary information about the specified  CloudFormation
              extension.

              Type -> (string)
                 The kind of extension.

              TypeName -> (string)
                 The name of the extension.

                 If  you  specified a TypeNameAlias when you activate this ex-
                 tension in your account and region, CloudFormation  considers
                 that alias as the type name.

              DefaultVersionId -> (string)
                 The  ID  of the default version of the extension. The default
                 version is used when the extension version is not specified.

                 This applies only to private extensions you  have  registered
                 in  your  account. For public extensions, both those provided
                 by Amazon and published by third parties, CloudFormation  re-
                 turns null . For more information, see RegisterType .

                 To  set the default version of an extension, use ``  SetType-
                 DefaultVersion `` .

              TypeArn -> (string)
                 The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the extension.

              LastUpdated -> (timestamp)
                 When the specified extension version was registered. This ap-
                 plies only to:

                 o Private extensions you have registered in your account. For
                   more information, see RegisterType .

                 o Public extensions you have activated in your  account  with
                   auto-update    specified.   For   more   information,   see
                   ActivateType .

                 For all other extension types, CloudFormation returns null .

              Description -> (string)
                 The description of the extension.

              PublisherId -> (string)
                 The ID of the extension publisher, if the extension  is  pub-
                 lished  by  a  third party. Extensions published by Amazon do
                 not return a publisher ID.

              OriginalTypeName -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count and region, the type name of the public extension.

                 If  you specified a TypeNameAlias when enabling the extension
                 in this account and region, CloudFormation treats that  alias
                 as  the  extension's type name within the account and region,
                 not the type name of the public extension. For more  informa-
                 tion,  see  Specifying  aliases to refer to extensions in the
                 CloudFormation User Guide .

              PublicVersionNumber -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count  and  region, the version of the public extension to be
                 used for CloudFormation operations in this  account  and  re-
                 gion.

                 How  you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension af-
                 fects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the exten-
                 tion  in  this  account  and region when a new version is re-
                 leased. For more information, see Setting  CloudFormation  to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              LatestPublicVersion -> (string)
                 For public extensions that have been activated for  this  ac-
                 count  and region, the latest version of the public extension
                 that is available . For any extensions other  than  activated
                 third-arty extensions, CloudFormation returns null .

                 How  you specified AutoUpdate when enabling the extension af-
                 fects whether CloudFormation automatically updates the exten-
                 tion  in  this  account  and region when a new version is re-
                 leased. For more information, see Setting  CloudFormation  to
                 automatically use new versions of extensions in the CloudFor-
                 mation User Guide .

              PublisherIdentity -> (string)
                 The service used to verify the publisher identity.

                 For more information, see Registering your account to publish
                 CloudFormation  extensions  in the CFN-CLI User Guide for Ex-
                 tension Development .

              PublisherName -> (string)
                 The publisher name, as defined in the public profile for that
                 publisher  in  the service used to verify the publisher iden-
                 tity.

              IsActivated -> (boolean)
                 Whether or not the extension is activated  for  this  account
                 and region.

                 This  applies  only  to third-party public extensions. Exten-
                 sions published by Amazon are activated by default.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          this action again and assign that  token  to  the  request  object's
          NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results, NextToken
          is set to null .
