GET-TEMPLATE()                                                  GET-TEMPLATE()



NAME
       get-template -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  template body for a specified stack. You can get the tem-
       plate for running or deleted stacks.

       For deleted stacks, GetTemplate returns the template for up to 90  days
       after the stack has been deleted.

       NOTE:
          If the template doesn't exist, a ValidationError is returned.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            get-template
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--change-set-name <value>]
          [--template-stage <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or  the unique stack ID that's associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --change-set-name (string)
          The  name  or  Amazon  Resource Name (ARN) of a change set for which
          CloudFormation returns the associated template.  If  you  specify  a
          name, you must also specify the StackName .

       --template-stage (string)
          For  templates  that  include  transforms, the stage of the template
          that CloudFormation returns. To  get  the  user-submitted  template,
          specify Original . To get the template after CloudFormation has pro-
          cessed all transforms, specify Processed .

          If the template doesn't include transforms, Original  and  Processed
          return  the same template. By default, CloudFormation specifies Pro-
          cessed .

          Possible values:

          o Original

          o Processed

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To view the template body for an AWS CloudFormation stack

       The following get-template command shows the template for  the  mytest-
       stack stack:

          aws cloudformation get-template --stack-name myteststack

       Output:

          {
              "TemplateBody": {
                  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion": "2010-09-09",
                  "Outputs": {
                      "BucketName": {
                          "Description": "Name of S3 bucket to hold website content",
                          "Value": {
                              "Ref": "S3Bucket"
                          }
                      }
                  },
                  "Description": "AWS CloudFormation Sample Template S3_Bucket: Sample template showing how to create a publicly accessible S3 bucket. **WARNING** This template creates an S3 bucket. You will be billed for the AWS resources used if you create a stack from this template.",
                  "Resources": {
                      "S3Bucket": {
                          "Type": "AWS::S3::Bucket",
                          "Properties": {
                              "AccessControl": "PublicRead"
                          }
                      }
                  }
              }
          }

OUTPUT
       TemplateBody -> (string)
          Structure containing the template body. (For more information, go to
          Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.)

          CloudFormation returns the same template  that  was  used  when  the
          stack was created.

       StagesAvailable -> (list)
          The  stage  of  the  template that you can retrieve. For stacks, the
          Original and Processed templates are always  available.  For  change
          sets,  the  Original template is always available. After CloudForma-
          tion finishes creating the change set, the  Processed  template  be-
          comes available.
