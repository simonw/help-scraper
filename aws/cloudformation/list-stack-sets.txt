LIST-STACK-SETS()                                            LIST-STACK-SETS()



NAME
       list-stack-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack sets that are associated with
       the user.

       o [Self-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs  parameter  to  SELF
         while  signed  in  to your Amazon Web Services account, ListStackSets
         returns all self-managed stack sets in your Amazon Web  Services  ac-
         count.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to SELF
         while signed in to the organization's management account,  ListStack-
         Sets returns all stack sets in the management account.

       o [Service-managed permissions] If you set the CallAs parameter to DEL-
         EGATED_ADMIN while signed in to your  member  account,  ListStackSets
         returns  all  stack sets with service-managed permissions in the man-
         agement account.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-sets is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be is-
       sued  in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can dis-
       able pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When  using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-sets
          [--status <value>]
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --status (string)
          The  status  of the stack sets that you want to get summary informa-
          tion about.

          Possible values:

          o ACTIVE

          o DELETED

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account  administrator  in  the management account or as a delegated
          administrator in a member account.

          By default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets  with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN . Your Amazon Web Services account must be  regis-
            tered  as a delegated administrator in the management account. For
            more information, see Register a delegated  administrator  in  the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list of StackSetSummary structures that contain information about
          the user's stack sets.

          (structure)
              The structures that contain summary information about the speci-
              fied stack set.

              StackSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the stack set.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack set.

              Description -> (string)
                 A  description  of  the  stack  set that you specify when the
                 stack set is created or updated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The status of the stack set.

              AutoDeployment -> (structure)
                 [Service-managed permissions] Describes whether StackSets au-
                 tomatically  deploys to Organizations accounts that are added
                 to a target organizational unit (OU).

                 Enabled -> (boolean)
                     If set to true , StackSets  automatically  deploys  addi-
                     tional stack instances to Organizations accounts that are
                     added to a target  organization  or  organizational  unit
                     (OU)  in  the specified Regions. If an account is removed
                     from a target organization or OU, StackSets deletes stack
                     instances from the account in the specified Regions.

                 RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
                     If set to true , stack resources are retained when an ac-
                     count is removed from a target organization or OU. If set
                     to  false  , stack resources are deleted. Specify only if
                     Enabled is set to True .

              PermissionModel -> (string)
                 Describes how the IAM roles required for stack set operations
                 are created.

                 o With self-managed permissions, you must create the adminis-
                   trator and execution roles required to deploy to target ac-
                   counts.  For more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack
                   Set Permissions .

                 o With service-managed permissions,  StackSets  automatically
                   creates  the  IAM roles required to deploy to accounts man-
                   aged by Organizations. For more information, see Grant Ser-
                   vice-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of  the  stack set's actual configuration compared to
                 its expected template and parameter  configuration.  A  stack
                 set is considered to have drifted if one or more of its stack
                 instances have drifted from their expected template  and  pa-
                 rameter configuration.

                 o DRIFTED  :  One or more of the stack instances belonging to
                   the stack set stack differs from the expected template  and
                   parameter  configuration. A stack instance is considered to
                   have drifted if one or more of the resources in the associ-
                   ated stack have drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  : CloudFormation has not checked the stack set
                   for drift.

                 o IN_SYNC : All of the stack instances belonging to the stack
                   set  stack  match  from the expected template and parameter
                   configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion  operation on the stack set. This value will be NULL for
                 any stack set on which drift detection has not yet been  per-
                 formed.

              ManagedExecution -> (structure)
                 Describes  whether  StackSets performs non-conflicting opera-
                 tions concurrently and queues conflicting operations.

                 Active -> (boolean)
                     When true , StackSets performs non-conflicting operations
                     concurrently  and  queues  conflicting  operations. After
                     conflicting operations finish,  StackSets  starts  queued
                     operations in request order.

                     NOTE:
                        If  there  are  already  running or queued operations,
                        StackSets queues all incoming operations even if  they
                        are non-conflicting.

                        You can't modify your stack set's execution configura-
                        tion while there are running or queued operations  for
                        that stack set.

                     When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at
                     a time in request order.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          ListStackInstances again and assign that token to  the  request  ob-
          ject's  NextToken  parameter.  If  the  request returns all results,
          NextToken is set to null .
