LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()                                  LIST-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns descriptions of all resources of the specified stack.

       For deleted stacks, ListStackResources returns resource information for
       up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: StackResourceSummaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-resources
          --stack-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list resources in a stack

       The following command displays the list of resources in  the  specified
       stack.

          aws cloudformation list-stack-resources \
              --stack-name my-stack

OUTPUT
       StackResourceSummaries -> (list)
          A list of StackResourceSummary structures.

          (structure)
              Contains  high-level  information  about the specified stack re-
              source.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a  physical
                 instance ID of the resource.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 Type  of  resource.  (For  more information, go to Amazon Web
                 Services Resource Types Reference in the CloudFormation  User
                 Guide.)

              LastUpdatedTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time the status was updated.

              ResourceStatus -> (string)
                 Current status of the resource.

              ResourceStatusReason -> (string)
                 Success/failure message associated with the resource.

              DriftInformation -> (structure)
                 Information about whether the resource's actual configuration
                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined  in  the  stack  template and any values specified as
                 template parameters. For more information, see Detecting  Un-
                 regulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                     Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to
                     its expected configuration.

                     o DELETED : The resource differs from its  expected  con-
                       figuration in that it has been deleted.

                     o MODIFIED  : The resource differs from its expected con-
                       figuration.

                     o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation hasn't checked if the  re-
                       source differs from its expected configuration. Any re-
                       sources that don't currently  support  drift  detection
                       have  a  status  of NOT_CHECKED . For more information,
                       see Resources that Support Drift  Detection  .  If  you
                       performed  an   ContinueUpdateRollback  operation  on a
                       stack, any resources included in  ResourcesToSkip  will
                       also  have  a status of NOT_CHECKED . For more informa-
                       tion about skipping resources  during  rollback  opera-
                       tions,  see  Continue  Rolling  Back  an  Update in the
                       CloudFormation User Guide.

                     o IN_SYNC : The resource's actual  configuration  matches
                       its expected configuration.

                 LastCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                     When  CloudFormation  last  checked  if  the resource had
                     drifted from its expected configuration.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was  created,  if  the resource was created from a module in-
                 cluded in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concatenated list of the module type or types  contain-
                     ing  the  resource. Module types are listed starting with
                     the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module   of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that's
                     nested inside a parent module of type  AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-
                        ULE

                 LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concatenated list of the logical IDs of the  module  or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module, moduleA , that's nested inside a  parent  module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB

                     For more information, see Referencing resources in a mod-
                     ule in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the  next  page
          of  stack  resources.  If  no  additional page exists, this value is
          null.
