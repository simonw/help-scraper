NAME
       describe-stack-resource-drifts -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  drift information for the resources that have been checked for
       drift in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected config-
       uration values for resources where CloudFormation detects configuration
       drift.

       For a given stack, there will be one StackResourceDrift for each  stack
       resource  that  has  been checked for drift. Resources that haven't yet
       been checked for drift aren't included. Resources that don't  currently
       support drift detection aren't checked, and so not included. For a list
       of resources that support drift detection, see Resources  that  Support
       Drift Detection .

       Use   DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual resources,
       or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all supported resources  for  a
       given stack.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-resource-drifts
          --stack-name <value>
          [--stack-resource-drift-status-filters <value>]
          [--next-token <value>]
          [--max-results <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack for which you want drift information.

       --stack-resource-drift-status-filters (list)
          The  resource drift status values to use as filters for the resource
          drift results returned.

          o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template configu-
            ration in that the resource has been deleted.

          o MODIFIED  :  One or more resource properties differ from their ex-
            pected template values.

          o IN_SYNC : The resource's actual configuration matches its expected
            template configuration.

          o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation doesn't currently return this value.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            IN_SYNC
            MODIFIED
            DELETED
            NOT_CHECKED

       --next-token (string)
          A  string  that identifies the next page of stack resource drift re-
          sults.

       --max-results (integer)
          The maximum number of results to be returned with a single call.  If
          the  number  of available results exceeds this maximum, the response
          includes a NextToken value that you can assign to the NextToken  re-
          quest parameter to get the next set of results.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about resources that drifted from the stack  defini-
       tion

       The  following command displays information about drifted resources for
       the  specified  stack.  To  initiate  drift  detection,  use  the   de-
       tect-stack-drift command.:

          aws cloudformation describe-stack-resource-drifts \
              --stack-name my-stack

       The output shows an AWS Lambda function that was modified out-of-band:

OUTPUT
       StackResourceDrifts -> (list)
          Drift information for the resources that have been checked for drift
          in the specified stack. This includes actual and expected configura-
          tion values for resources where CloudFormation detects drift.

          For  a  given  stack,  there will be one StackResourceDrift for each
          stack resource that has  been  checked  for  drift.  Resources  that
          haven't  yet  been checked for drift aren't included. Resources that
          do not currently support drift detection aren't checked, and so  not
          included.  For a list of resources that support drift detection, see
          Resources that Support Drift Detection .

          (structure)
              Contains the drift information for  a  resource  that  has  been
              checked  for  drift.  This includes actual and expected property
              values for resources in which CloudFormation has detected drift.
              Only  resource  properties  explicitly defined in the stack tem-
              plate are checked for drift. For more information, see Detecting
              Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

              Resources  that don't currently support drift detection can't be
              checked. For a list of resources that support  drift  detection,
              see Resources that Support Drift Detection .

              Use   DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on individual re-
              sources, or  DetectStackDrift to detect drift on  all  resources
              in a given stack that support drift detection.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

              PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical
                 instance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

              PhysicalResourceIdContext -> (list)
                 Context information that enables CloudFormation  to  uniquely
                 identify  a  resource.  CloudFormation uses context key-value
                 pairs in cases where a resource's logical  and  physical  IDs
                 aren't  enough  to uniquely identify that resource. Each con-
                 text key-value pair specifies a unique resource that contains
                 the targeted resource.

                 (structure)
                     Context   information   that  enables  CloudFormation  to
                     uniquely identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context
                     key-value  pairs  in cases where a resource's logical and
                     physical IDs aren't enough to uniquely identify that  re-
                     source.  Each context key-value pair specifies a resource
                     that contains the targeted resource.

                     Key -> (string)
                        The resource context key.

                     Value -> (string)
                        The resource context value.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource.

              ExpectedProperties -> (string)
                 A JSON structure containing the expected property  values  of
                 the  stack resource, as defined in the stack template and any
                 values specified as template parameters.

                 For resources whose  StackResourceDriftStatus  is  DELETED  ,
                 this structure will not be present.

              ActualProperties -> (string)
                 A JSON structure containing the actual property values of the
                 stack resource.

                 For resources whose  StackResourceDriftStatus  is  DELETED  ,
                 this structure will not be present.

              PropertyDifferences -> (list)
                 A  collection  of the resource properties whose actual values
                 differ from their expected values. These will be present only
                 for resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED .

                 (structure)
                     Information  about a resource property whose actual value
                     differs from its expected value, as defined in the  stack
                     template and any values specified as template parameters.
                     These will be present only for resources  whose  StackRe-
                     sourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED . For more information, see
                     Detecting Unregulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and
                     Resources .

                     PropertyPath -> (string)

                     ExpectedValue -> (string)
                        The  expected property value of the resource property,
                        as defined in the stack template and any values speci-
                        fied as template parameters.

                     ActualValue -> (string)
                        The actual property value of the resource property.

                     DifferenceType -> (string)
                        The type of property difference.

                        o ADD  : A value has been added to a resource property
                          that's an array or list data type.

                        o REMOVE : The property has been removed from the cur-
                          rent resource configuration.

                        o NOT_EQUAL  : The current property value differs from
                          its expected value (as defined in the stack template
                          and any values specified as template parameters).

              StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status of the resource's actual configuration compared to its
                 expected configuration.

                   configuration because the resource has been deleted.

                 o MODIFIED  :  One  or  more  resource properties differ from
                   their expected values (as defined in the stack template and
                   any values specified as template parameters).

                 o IN_SYNC  :  The resource's actual configuration matches its
                   expected template configuration.

                 o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation does not currently return this
                   value.

              Timestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Time at which CloudFormation performed drift detection on the
                 stack resource.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was  created,  if  the resource was created from a module in-
                 cluded in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concatenated list of the module type or types  contain-
                     ing  the  resource. Module types are listed starting with
                     the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module   of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,  that's
                     nested inside a parent module of type  AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .
                        AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MOD-
                        ULE

                 LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                     A concatenated list of the logical IDs of the  module  or
                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module, moduleA , that's nested inside a  parent  module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB

                     For more information, see Referencing resources in a mod-
                     ule in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all the remaining  results,  NextToken
          is  set  to  a  token. To retrieve the next set of results, call De-
          scribeStackResourceDrifts again and assign that token to the request
          object's  NextToken  parameter.  If the request returns all results,
          NextToken is set to null .
