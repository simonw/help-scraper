DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-LIMITS()                            DESCRIBE-ACCOUNT-LIMITS()



NAME
       describe-account-limits -

DESCRIPTION
       Retrieves  your  account's  CloudFormation  limits, such as the maximum
       number of stacks that you can create in your account. For more informa-
       tion about account limits, see CloudFormation Quotas in the CloudForma-
       tion User Guide .

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       describe-account-limits is a paginated operation.  Multiple  API  calls
       may  be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You
       can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate  argument.   When
       using  --output  text and the --query argument on a paginated response,
       the --query argument must extract data from the results of the  follow-
       ing query expressions: AccountLimits

SYNOPSIS
            describe-account-limits
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To get information about your account limits

       The following command retrieves a list of regional limits for the  cur-
       rent account.

          aws cloudformation describe-account-limits

       Output:

          {
              "AccountLimits": [
                  {
                      "Name": "StackLimit",
                      "Value": 200
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "StackOutputsLimit",
                      "Value": 60
                  },
                  {
                      "Name": "ConcurrentResourcesLimit",
                      "Value": 2500
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       AccountLimits -> (list)
          An account limit structure that contain a list of CloudFormation ac-
          count limits and their values.

          (structure)
              The AccountLimit data type.

              CloudFormation has the following limits per account:

              o Number of concurrent resources

              o Number of stacks

              o Number of stack outputs

              For more information  about  these  account  limits,  and  other
              CloudFormation  limits,  see CloudFormation quotas in the Cloud-
              Formation User Guide .

              Name -> (string)
                 The name of the account limit.

                 Values: ConcurrentResourcesLimit | StackLimit |  StackOutput-
                 sLimit

              Value -> (integer)
                 The value that's associated with the account limit name.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output  exceeds  1 MB in size, a string that identifies the
          next page of limits. If no additional page  exists,  this  value  is
          null.
