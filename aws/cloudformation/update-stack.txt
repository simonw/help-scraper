UPDATE-STACK()                                                  UPDATE-STACK()



NAME
       update-stack -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes
       successfully, the stack update starts. You can check the status of  the
       stack through the  DescribeStacks action.

       To  get  a  copy of the template for an existing stack, you can use the
       GetTemplate action.

       For more information about creating  an  update  template,  updating  a
       stack,  and monitoring the progress of the update, see Updating a Stack
       .

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or unique stack ID of the stack to update.

       --template-body (string)
          Structure containing the template body with a minimum  length  of  1
          byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. (For more information, go
          to Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide.)

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody  , TemplateURL , or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true
          .

       --template-url (string)
          Location of file containing the template body. The URL must point to
          a  template  that's located in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Man-
          ager document. For more information, go to Template Anatomy  in  the
          CloudFormation User Guide.

          Conditional:  You must specify only one of the following parameters:
          TemplateBody , TemplateURL , or set the UsePreviousTemplate to  true
          .

       --use-previous-template | --no-use-previous-template (boolean)
          Reuse  the  existing template that is associated with the stack that
          you are updating.

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody  , TemplateURL , or set the UsePreviousTemplate to true
          .

       --stack-policy-during-update-body (string)
          Structure containing the temporary overriding stack policy body. You
          can specify either the StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPoli-
          cyDuringUpdateURL parameter, but not both.

          If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary over-
          riding stack policy during this update. If you don't specify a stack
          policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be
          used.

       --stack-policy-during-update-url (string)
          Location of a file containing the temporary overriding stack policy.
          The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB)  located  in  an  S3
          bucket  in  the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the
          StackPolicyDuringUpdateBody or the StackPolicyDuringUpdateURL param-
          eter, but not both.

          If you want to update protected resources, specify a temporary over-
          riding stack policy during this update. If you don't specify a stack
          policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack will be
          used.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
          stack. For more information, see the Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During  a stack update, use the existing parameter value that
                 the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you  specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This field is returned only for SSM parameter  types  in  the
                 template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (list)
          In  some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack tem-
          plate contains certain capabilities in order for  CloudFormation  to
          update the stack.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM  and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web  Services  account;  for example, by creating new Identity and
            Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must  explic-
            itly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
            following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABIL-
            ITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If  you  have  IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If you don't specify either of these  capabilities,  CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you
          review all permissions associated with them and edit  their  permis-
          sions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some template contain macros. Macros per-
            form  custom  processing on templates; this can include simple ac-
            tions like find-and-replace operations, all the way  to  extensive
            transformations  of entire templates. Because of this, users typi-
            cally create a change set from the  processed  template,  so  that
            they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actu-
            ally updating the stack. If your stack template  contains  one  or
            more  macros,  and  you choose to update a stack directly from the
            processed template, without first reviewing the resulting  changes
            in  a  change  set, you must acknowledge this capability. This in-
            cludes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which  are
            macros  hosted  by  CloudFormation.  If you want to update a stack
            from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks,  you
            must  update the stack directly from the template using this capa-
            bility.

          WARNING:
                 You should only update stacks directly from a stack  template
                 that  contains  macros  if you know what processing the macro
                 performs. Each macro relies on an underlying  Lambda  service
                 function  for  processing  stack templates. Be aware that the
                 Lambda function owner can update the function operation with-
                 out CloudFormation being notified.

              For more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform
              Custom Processing on Templates .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --resource-types (list)
          The template resource types that you have permissions to  work  with
          for   this   update  stack  action,  such  as  AWS::EC2::Instance  ,
          AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance .

          If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource that you're
          updating,  the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants
          permissions to all resource types. Identity  and  Access  Management
          (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys
          in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling  Access  with
          Identity and Access Management .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to update the  stack.  Cloud-
          Formation  uses the role's credentials to make calls on your behalf.
          CloudFormation always uses this role for all  future  operations  on
          the  stack.  Provided  that  users have permission to operate on the
          stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the  users  don't  have
          permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.

          If  you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
          previously associated with the  stack.  If  no  role  is  available,
          CloudFormation  uses a temporary session that is generated from your
          user credentials.

       --rollback-configuration (structure)
          The rollback triggers for CloudFormation  to  monitor  during  stack
          creation  and  updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you  do  specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To use the rollback triggers  previously  specified  for  this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To  specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers  you've  specified before (for example, when creating the
                stack or during a previous stack update).  Any  triggers  that
                you  don't  include  in  the  updated  list of triggers are no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To remove all currently specified triggers, specify  an  empty
                list for this parameter.

              If  a  specified  trigger is missing, the entire stack operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A rollback trigger CloudFormation  monitors  during  creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm or AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The  amount  of  time,  in  minutes, during which CloudFormation
              should monitor all the rollback triggers after  the  stack  cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If  you  specify a monitoring period but don't specify any roll-
              back triggers, CloudFormation still waits the  specified  period
              of  time  before  cleaning  up old resources after update opera-
              tions. You can use this monitoring period to perform any  manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.

              If you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still  moni-
              tors  the  specified rollback triggers during stack creation and
              update operations. Then, for update operations, it  begins  dis-
              posing  of  old  resources  immediately  once the operation com-
              pletes.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RollbackTriggers=[{Arn=string,Type=string},{Arn=string,Type=string}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RollbackTriggers": [
              {
                "Arn": "string",
                "Type": "string"
              }
              ...
            ],
            "MonitoringTimeInMinutes": integer
          }

       --stack-policy-body (string)
          Structure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either
          the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.

          You  might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect
          a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you  don't
          specify  a  stack policy, the current policy that is associated with
          the stack is unchanged.

       --stack-policy-url (string)
          Location of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must
          point  to  a  policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the
          same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody
          or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.

          You  might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect
          a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you  don't
          specify  a  stack policy, the current policy that is associated with
          the stack is unchanged.

       --notification-arns (list)
          Amazon Simple  Notification  Service  topic  Amazon  Resource  Names
          (ARNs)  that  CloudFormation  associates  with the stack. Specify an
          empty list to remove all notification topics.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs to associate with this  stack.  CloudFormation  also
          propagates  these  tags to supported resources in the stack. You can
          specify a maximum number of 50 tags.

          If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation  doesn't  modify
          the  stack's tags. If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation re-
          moves all associated tags.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --disable-rollback | --no-disable-rollback (boolean)
          Preserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an oper-
          ation fails.

          Default: False

       --client-request-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this token
          if  you  plan  to  retry  requests so that CloudFormation knows that
          you're not attempting to update a stack  with  the  same  name.  You
          might  retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation suc-
          cessfully received them.

          All events triggered by a given stack  operation  are  assigned  the
          same  client  request  token, which you can use to track operations.
          For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with  the  token
          token1  ,  then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will
          have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .

          In the console, stack operations display the client request token on
          the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console
          use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID  ,  which  helps  you
          easily  identify  the stack operation . For example, if you create a
          stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same
          token      in     the     following     format:     Console-CreateS-
          tack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .

       --retain-except-on-create | --no-retain-except-on-create (boolean)
          This deletion policy deletes newly created  resources,  but  retains
          existing  resources, when a stack operation is rolled back. This en-
          sures new, empty, and unused resources are deleted,  while  critical
          resources  and  their data are retained. RetainExceptOnCreate can be
          specified for any resource that supports the  DeletionPolicy  attri-
          bute.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update AWS CloudFormation stacks

       The  following  update-stack command updates the template and input pa-
       rameters for the mystack stack:

          aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/sample/updated.template --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,ParameterValue=SampleKeyPair ParameterKey=SubnetIDs,ParameterValue=SampleSubnetID1\\,SampleSubnetID2

       The following update-stack command updates just the SubnetIDs parameter
       value  for  the  mystack stack. If you don't specify a parameter value,
       the default value that is specified in the template is used:

          aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/sample/updated.template --parameters ParameterKey=KeyPairName,UsePreviousValue=true ParameterKey=SubnetIDs,ParameterValue=SampleSubnetID1\\,UpdatedSampleSubnetID2

       The following update-stack command adds two stack  notification  topics
       to the mystack stack:

          aws cloudformation update-stack --stack-name mystack --use-previous-template --notification-arns "arn:aws:sns:use-east-1:123456789012:mytopic1" "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:mytopic2"

       For  more  information, see AWS CloudFormation stack updates in the AWS
       CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       StackId -> (string)
          Unique identifier of the stack.
