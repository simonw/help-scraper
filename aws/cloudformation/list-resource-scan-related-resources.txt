LIST-RESOURCE-SCAN-RELATED-RESOURCES()  LIST-RESOURCE-SCAN-RELATED-RESOURCES()



NAME
       list-resource-scan-related-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists  the  related  resources  for a list of resources from a resource
       scan. The response indicates whether each returned resource is  already
       managed by CloudFormation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       list-resource-scan-related-resources is a paginated operation. Multiple
       API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: RelatedResources

OPTIONS
       --resource-scan-id (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource scan.

       --resources (list)
          The list of resources for which you want  to  get  the  related  re-
          sources. Up to 100 resources can be provided.

          (structure)
              Identifies  a  scanned  resource.  This is used with the ListRe-
              sourceScanRelatedResources API action.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of the resource, such as AWS::DynamoDB::Table .  For
                 the  list  of  supported resources, see Resource type support
                 for imports and drift detection In  the  CloudFormation  User
                 Guide .

              ResourceIdentifier -> (map)
                 A  list  of  up  to  256  key-value pairs that identifies the
                 scanned resource. The key is the name of one of  the  primary
                 identifiers for the resource. (Primary identifiers are speci-
                 fied in the primaryIdentifier list in the  resource  schema.)
                 The  value is the value of that primary identifier. For exam-
                 ple, for a AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource, the primary identi-
                 fiers  is  TableName  so  the key-value pair could be "Table-
                 Name":   "MyDDBTable"   .   For   more    information,    see
                 primaryIdentifier  in  the CloudFormation Command Line Inter-
                 face (CLI) User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,ResourceIdentifier={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "ResourceIdentifier": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination. If automatic pagination is disabled,  the
       AWS CLI will only make one call, for the first page of results.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

OUTPUT
       RelatedResources -> (list)
          List  of  up  to MaxResults resources in the specified resource scan
          related to the specified resources.

          (structure)
              A scanned  resource  returned  by  ListResourceScanResources  or
              ListResourceScanRelatedResources .

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The  type of the resource, such as AWS::DynamoDB::Table . For
                 the list of supported resources, see  Resource  type  support
                 for  imports  and  drift detection In the CloudFormation User
                 Guide

              ResourceIdentifier -> (map)
                 A list of up to 256 key-value pairs that identifies  for  the
                 scanned  resource.  The key is the name of one of the primary
                 identifiers for the resource. (Primary identifiers are speci-
                 fied  in  the primaryIdentifier list in the resource schema.)
                 The value is the value of that primary identifier. For  exam-
                 ple, for a AWS::DynamoDB::Table resource, the primary identi-
                 fiers is TableName so the key-value  pair  could  be  "Table-
                 Name":    "MyDDBTable"    .   For   more   information,   see
                 primaryIdentifier in the CloudFormation Command  Line  Inter-
                 face (CLI) User Guide .

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

              ManagedByStack -> (boolean)
                 If true , the resource is managed by a CloudFormation stack.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  request doesn't return all the remaining results, NextToken
          is set to a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call ListRe-
          sourceScanRelatedResources  again and use that value for the NextTo-
          ken parameter. If the request returns all results, NextToken is  set
          to an empty string.
