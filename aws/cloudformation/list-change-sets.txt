LIST-CHANGE-SETS()                                          LIST-CHANGE-SETS()



NAME
       list-change-sets -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  the  ID  and status of each active change set for a stack. For
       example,  CloudFormation  lists  change  sets  that  are  in  the  CRE-
       ATE_IN_PROGRESS or CREATE_PENDING state.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-change-sets  is  a  paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be
       issued in order to retrieve the entire data set  of  results.  You  can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output text and the --query argument on  a  paginated  response,  the
       --query  argument  must  extract data from the results of the following
       query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-change-sets
          --stack-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the  stack  for  which
          you want to list change sets.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list change sets

       The following list-change-sets example displays a list of  the  pending
       change sets for the specified stack.

          aws cloudformation list-change-sets \
             --stack-name my-stack

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204",
                      "StackName": "my-stack",
                      "ChangeSetId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/70160340-7914-xmpl-bcbf-128a1fa78b5d",
                      "ChangeSetName": "my-change-set",
                      "ExecutionStatus": "AVAILABLE",
                      "Status": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
                      "CreationTime": "2019-10-02T05:38:54.297Z"
                  }
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A  list of ChangeSetSummary structures that provides the ID and sta-
          tus of each change set for the specified stack.

          (structure)
              The ChangeSetSummary structure describes a change set, its  sta-
              tus, and the stack with which it's associated.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack with which the change set is associated.

              StackName -> (string)
                 The  name  of  the stack with which the change set is associ-
                 ated.

              ChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The ID of the change set.

              ChangeSetName -> (string)
                 The name of the change set.

              ExecutionStatus -> (string)
                 If the change set execution status is AVAILABLE , you can ex-
                 ecute the change set. If you cant execute the change set, the
                 status indicates why. For example, a change set might  be  in
                 an UNAVAILABLE state because CloudFormation is still creating
                 it or in an OBSOLETE state because the stack was already  up-
                 dated.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  state  of  the  change set, such as CREATE_IN_PROGRESS ,
                 CREATE_COMPLETE , or FAILED .

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 A description of the change set's  status.  For  example,  if
                 your  change set is in the FAILED state, CloudFormation shows
                 the error message.

              CreationTime -> (timestamp)
                 The start time when the change set was created, in UTC.

              Description -> (string)
                 Descriptive information about the change set.

              IncludeNestedStacks -> (boolean)
                 Specifies the current setting of IncludeNestedStacks for  the
                 change set.

              ParentChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The parent change set ID.

              RootChangeSetId -> (string)
                 The root change set ID.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If  the  output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the next page
          of change sets. If there is no additional page, this value is null.
