REGISTER-TYPE()                                                REGISTER-TYPE()



NAME
       register-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Registers  an extension with the CloudFormation service. Registering an
       extension makes it available for use  in  CloudFormation  templates  in
       your Amazon Web Services account, and includes:

       o Validating the extension schema

       o Determining  which  handlers, if any, have been specified for the ex-
         tension

       o Making the extension available for use in your account

       For more information on how to develop extensions and  ready  them  for
       registeration,  see  Creating  Resource Providers in the CloudFormation
       CLI User Guide .

       You can have a maximum of 50 resource extension versions registered  at
       a  time. This maximum is per account and per region. Use DeregisterType
       to deregister specific extension versions if necessary.

       Once you have initiated a registration request using  ``   RegisterType
       ``  ,  you  can  use  ``   DescribeTypeRegistration  ``  to monitor the
       progress of the registration request.

       Once you have registered a private extension in your  account  and  re-
       gion,  use SetTypeConfiguration to specify configuration properties for
       the extension. For more information, see Configuring extensions at  the
       account level in the CloudFormation User Guide .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            register-type
          [--type <value>]
          --type-name <value>
          --schema-handler-package <value>
          [--logging-config <value>]
          [--execution-role-arn <value>]
          [--client-request-token <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --type (string)
          The kind of extension.

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension being registered.

          We recommend that extension names adhere to the following patterns:

          o For resource types, company_or_organization ::service ::type .

          o For modules, company_or_organization ::service ::type ::MODULE.

          NOTE:
              The following organization namespaces are reserved and cannot be
              used in your extension names:

              o Alexa

              o AMZN

              o Amazon

              o AWS

              o Custom

              o Dev

       --schema-handler-package (string)
          A url to the S3 bucket containing the extension project package that
          contains  the  neccessary files for the extension you want to regis-
          ter.

          For information on generating a schema handler package for  the  ex-
          tension  you  want to register, see submit in the CloudFormation CLI
          User Guide .

          NOTE:
              The user registering the extension must be able  to  access  the
              package  in  the  S3  bucket.  That  is,  the user needs to have
              GetObject permissions for the schema handler package.  For  more
              information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Ama-
              zon S3 in the Identity and Access Management User Guide .

       --logging-config (structure)
          Specifies logging configuration information for an extension.

          LogRoleArn -> (string)
              The ARN of the role that CloudFormation should assume when send-
              ing log entries to CloudWatch logs.

          LogGroupName -> (string)
              The  Amazon  CloudWatch  log group to which CloudFormation sends
              error logging information when  invoking  the  extension's  han-
              dlers.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          LogRoleArn=string,LogGroupName=string

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "LogRoleArn": "string",
            "LogGroupName": "string"
          }

       --execution-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role for CloudFormation to
          assume when invoking the extension.

          For CloudFormation to assume the specified execution role, the  role
          must  contain  a  trust relationship with the CloudFormation service
          principle (resources.cloudformation.amazonaws.com ). For more infor-
          mation  on  adding  trust  relationships, see Modifying a role trust
          policy in the Identity and Access Management User Guide .

          If your extension calls Amazon Web Services APIs in any of its  han-
          dlers,  you  must create an * IAM execution role * that includes the
          necessary permissions to call those Amazon Web  Services  APIs,  and
          provision  that  execution role in your account. When CloudFormation
          needs to invoke the resource type  handler,  CloudFormation  assumes
          this  execution  role  to create a temporary session token, which it
          then passes to the resource type handler, thereby supplying your re-
          source type with the appropriate credentials.

       --client-request-token (string)
          A  unique identifier that acts as an idempotency key for this regis-
          tration request. Specifying a client request token  prevents  Cloud-
          Formation from generating more than one version of an extension from
          the same registeration request, even if  the  request  is  submitted
          multiple times.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To register a resource type

       The  following  register-type  example registers the specified resource
       type as a private resource type in the user's account.

          aws cloudformation register-type \
              --type-name My::Organization::ResourceName \
              --schema-handler-package s3://bucket_name/my-organization-resource_name.zip \
              --type RESOURCE

       Output:

          {
              "RegistrationToken": "f5525280-104e-4d35-bef5-8f1f1example"
          }

       For more information, see Registering Resource Providers in the  Cloud-
       Formation Command Line Interface User Guide for Type Development.

OUTPUT
       RegistrationToken -> (string)
          The identifier for this registration request.

          Use  this  registration token when calling ``  DescribeTypeRegistra-
          tion `` , which returns information about the status and IDs of  the
          extension registration.
