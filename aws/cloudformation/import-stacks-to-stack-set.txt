IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()                      IMPORT-STACKS-TO-STACK-SET()



NAME
       import-stacks-to-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Use  the  stack  import  operations for self-managed or service-managed
       StackSets. For self-managed StackSets, the import operation can  import
       stacks in the administrator account or in different target accounts and
       Amazon Web Services Regions. For service-managed StackSets, the  import
       operation  can  import  any  stack in the same AWS Organizations as the
       management account. The import operation can import up to 10 stacks us-
       ing inline stack IDs or up to 10,000 stacks using an Amazon S3 object.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  of  the  stack set. The name must be unique in the Region
          where you create your stack set.

       --stack-ids (list)
          The IDs of the stacks you are importing into a stack set. You import
          up to 10 stacks per stack set at a time.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --stack-ids-url (string)
          The Amazon S3 URL which contains list of stack ids to be inputted.

          Specify either StackIds or StackIdsUrl .

       --organizational-unit-ids (list)
          The  list  of  OU  IDs  to which the stacks being imported has to be
          mapped as deployment target.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          The user-specified preferences for  how  CloudFormation  performs  a
          stack set operation.

          For more information on maximum concurrent accounts and failure tol-
          erance, see Stack set operation options .

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The concurrency type of deploying StackSets  operations  in  Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The  order of the Regions in where you want to perform the stack
              operation.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail  before  CloudFormation stops the operation in that Region.
              If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation  doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration  can  fail  before CloudFormation stops the operation in
              that Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region,  CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The  maximum  number of accounts in which to perform this opera-
              tion at one time. This is dependent on the value of  FailureTol-
              eranceCount  .  MaxConcurrentCount  is at most one more than the
              FailureToleranceCount .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],
            "FailureToleranceCount": integer,
            "FailureTolerancePercentage": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentCount": integer,
            "MaxConcurrentPercentage": integer
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          A unique, user defined, identifier for the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o For service managed stack sets, specify DELEGATED_ADMIN .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique identifier for the stack set operation.
