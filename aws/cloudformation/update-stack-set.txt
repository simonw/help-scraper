UPDATE-STACK-SET()                                          UPDATE-STACK-SET()



NAME
       update-stack-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Updates  the stack set, and associated stack instances in the specified
       accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions.

       Even if the stack set operation created by updating the stack set fails
       (completely  or  partially,  below  or above a specified failure toler-
       ance), the stack set is updated with your changes. Subsequent  CreateS-
       tackInstances  calls  on  the specified stack set use the updated stack
       set.

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to update.

       --description (string)
          A brief description of updates that you are making.

       --template-body (string)
          The structure that contains the template body, with a minimum length
          of  1  byte  and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. For more informa-
          tion, see Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide .

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --template-url (string)
          The  location  of  the file that contains the template body. The URL
          must point to a template (maximum size: 460,800 bytes) that  is  lo-
          cated in an Amazon S3 bucket or a Systems Manager document. For more
          information, see Template Anatomy in the CloudFormation User Guide .

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --use-previous-template | --no-use-previous-template (boolean)
          Use  the existing template that's associated with the stack set that
          you're updating.

          Conditional: You must specify only one of the following  parameters:
          TemplateBody or TemplateURL or set UsePreviousTemplate to true.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of input parameters for the stack set template.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During  a stack update, use the existing parameter value that
                 the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you  specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This field is returned only for SSM parameter  types  in  the
                 template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (list)
          In  some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack tem-
          plate contains certain capabilities in order for  CloudFormation  to
          update the stack set and its associated stack instances.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM  and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web  Services  account;  for example, by creating new Identity and
            Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks sets, you must ex-
            plicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities.
            The following IAM resources require you to specify either the  CA-
            PABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If  you  have  IAM resources with custom names, you must specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If you don't specify either of these  capabilities,  CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If  your  stack template contains these resources, we recommend that
          you review all permissions associated with them and edit their  per-
          missions if necessary.

              o AWS::IAM::AccessKey

              o AWS::IAM::Group

              o AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile

              o AWS::IAM::Policy

              o AWS::IAM::Role

              o AWS::IAM::User

              o AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition

          For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudForma-
          tion Templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some templates reference macros. If  your
            stack  set template references one or more macros, you must update
            the stack set directly from the processed template, without  first
            reviewing  the  resulting  changes  in a change set. To update the
            stack set directly, you must acknowledge this capability. For more
            information,  see  Using  CloudFormation  Macros to Perform Custom
            Processing on Templates .

          WARNING:
              Stack sets with service-managed  permissions  do  not  currently
              support  the  use  of  macros  in  templates. (This includes the
              AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms,  which  are  macros
              hosted  by  CloudFormation.) Even if you specify this capability
              for a stack set with service-managed permissions, if you  refer-
              ence a macro in your template the stack set operation will fail.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --tags (list)
          The  key-value pairs to associate with this stack set and the stacks
          created from it. CloudFormation also propagates these tags  to  sup-
          ported  resources  that are created in the stacks. You can specify a
          maximum number of 50 tags.

          If you specify tags for this parameter, those tags replace any  list
          of  tags  that  are  currently  associated with this stack set. This
          means:

          o If you don't specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn't modify
            the stack's tags.

          o If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all
            the tags that you want associated with this stack set,  even  tags
            you've  specified before (for example, when creating the stack set
            or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that  you
            don't  include  in  the  updated list of tags are removed from the
            stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.

          o If you specify an empty value,  CloudFormation  removes  all  cur-
            rently associated tags.

          If  you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, Cloud-
          Formation checks to see if you have the required IAM  permission  to
          tag  resources.  If you omit tags that are currently associated with
          the stack set from the list of tags you specify, CloudFormation  as-
          sumes  that  you  want  to remove those tags from the stack set, and
          checks to see if you have permission  to  untag  resources.  If  you
          don't  have  the  necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet
          action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set  is  not
          updated.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required . A string used to identify this tag. You can  spec-
                 ify  a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by
                 Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have  the  reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required  .  A  string containing the value for this tag. You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --operation-preferences (structure)
          Preferences for how CloudFormation performs this  stack  set  opera-
          tion.

          RegionConcurrencyType -> (string)
              The  concurrency  type  of deploying StackSets operations in Re-
              gions, could be in parallel or one Region at a time.

          RegionOrder -> (list)
              The order of the Regions where you want to perform the stack op-
              eration.

              NOTE:
                 RegionOrder isn't followed if AutoDeployment is enabled.

              (string)

          FailureToleranceCount -> (integer)
              The number of accounts, per Region, for which this operation can
              fail before CloudFormation stops the operation in  that  Region.
              If  the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFormation doesn't
              attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              Conditional: You must specify  either  FailureToleranceCount  or
              FailureTolerancePercentage (but not both).

              By default, 0 is specified.

          FailureTolerancePercentage -> (integer)
              The percentage of accounts, per Region, for which this stack op-
              eration can fail before CloudFormation stops  the  operation  in
              that  Region. If the operation is stopped in a Region, CloudFor-
              mation doesn't attempt the operation in any subsequent Regions.

              When calculating the number of accounts based on  the  specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.

              Conditional:  You  must  specify either FailureToleranceCount or
              FailureTolerancePercentage , but not both.

              By default, 0 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentCount -> (integer)
              The maximum number of accounts in which to perform  this  opera-
              tion  at one time. This can depend on the value of FailureToler-
              anceCount depending on your ConcurrencyMode . MaxConcurrentCount
              is at most one more than the FailureToleranceCount if you're us-
              ing STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE .

              Note that this setting lets you specify the maximum  for  opera-
              tions.  For  large  deployments, under certain circumstances the
              actual number of accounts acted upon concurrently may  be  lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional:  You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          MaxConcurrentPercentage -> (integer)
              The maximum percentage of accounts in which to perform this  op-
              eration at one time.

              When  calculating  the number of accounts based on the specified
              percentage, CloudFormation rounds down to the next whole number.
              This is true except in cases where rounding down would result is
              zero. In this case, CloudFormation sets the number  as  one  in-
              stead.

              Note  that  this setting lets you specify the maximum for opera-
              tions. For large deployments, under  certain  circumstances  the
              actual  number  of accounts acted upon concurrently may be lower
              due to service throttling.

              Conditional: You must specify either MaxConcurrentCount or  Max-
              ConcurrentPercentage , but not both.

              By default, 1 is specified.

          ConcurrencyMode -> (string)
              Specifies how the concurrency level behaves during the operation
              execution.

              o STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option dynamically lowers  the
                concurrency  level  to  ensure  the  number of failed accounts
                never exceeds the value of FailureToleranceCount +1. The  ini-
                tial  actual  concurrency  is  set  to the lower of either the
                value of the MaxConcurrentCount , or the value  of  MaxConcur-
                rentCount  +1.  The actual concurrency is then reduced propor-
                tionally by the number of failures. This is the default behav-
                ior.  If  failure tolerance or Maximum concurrent accounts are
                set to percentages, the behavior is similar.

              o SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE : This option  decouples  FailureToler-
                anceCount  from  the actual concurrency. This allows stack set
                operations to run at the concurrency level set by the  MaxCon-
                currentCount value, or MaxConcurrentPercentage , regardless of
                the number of failures.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          RegionConcurrencyType=string,RegionOrder=string,string,FailureToleranceCount=integer,FailureTolerancePercentage=integer,MaxConcurrentCount=integer,MaxConcurrentPercentage=integer,ConcurrencyMode=string

       JSON Syntax:

            "RegionConcurrencyType": "SEQUENTIAL"|"PARALLEL",
            "RegionOrder": ["string", ...],

            "ConcurrencyMode": "STRICT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"|"SOFT_FAILURE_TOLERANCE"
          }

       --administration-role-arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to use to update this
          stack set.

          Specify  an  IAM role only if you are using customized administrator
          roles to control which users or groups  can  manage  specific  stack
          sets  within  the  same administrator account. For more information,
          see Granting Permissions for Stack Set Operations in the CloudForma-
          tion User Guide .

          If  you  specified  a customized administrator role when you created
          the stack set, you must specify  a  customized  administrator  role,
          even  if it is the same customized administrator role used with this
          stack set previously.

       --execution-role-name (string)
          The name of the IAM execution role to use to update the  stack  set.
          If  you  do  not  specify an execution role, CloudFormation uses the
          AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole role for the stack set opera-
          tion.

          Specify an IAM role only if you are using customized execution roles
          to control which stack resources users and  groups  can  include  in
          their stack sets.

          If you specify a customized execution role, CloudFormation uses that
          role to update the stack. If you do not specify a customized  execu-
          tion  role, CloudFormation performs the update using the role previ-
          ously associated with the stack set, so long as you have permissions
          to perform operations on the stack set.

       --deployment-targets (structure)
          [Service-managed permissions] The Organizations accounts in which to
          update associated stack instances.

          To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
          not specify DeploymentTargets or Regions .

          If  the  stack set update includes changes to the template (that is,
          if TemplateBody or TemplateURL is specified), or  the  Parameters  ,
          CloudFormation  marks  all stack instances with a status of OUTDATED
          prior to updating the stack instances in the specified accounts  and
          Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set update doesn't include
          changes to the template or parameters,  CloudFormation  updates  the
          stack instances in the specified accounts and Regions, while leaving
          all other stack instances with their existing stack instance status.

          Accounts -> (list)
              The names of one or more Amazon Web Services accounts for  which
              you want to deploy stack set updates.

              (string)

          AccountsUrl -> (string)
              Returns the value of the AccountsUrl property.

          OrganizationalUnitIds -> (list)
              The  organization  root  ID  or  organizational unit (OU) IDs to
              which StackSets deploys.

              (string)

          AccountFilterType -> (string)
              Limit deployment targets to individual accounts or include addi-
              tional accounts with provided OUs.

              The  following  is a list of possible values for the AccountFil-
              terType operation.

              o INTERSECTION : StackSets deploys to the accounts specified  in
                Accounts parameter.

              o DIFFERENCE  : StackSets excludes the accounts specified in Ac-
                counts parameter. This enables user to avoid certain  accounts
                within an OU such as suspended accounts.

              o UNION : StackSets includes additional accounts deployment tar-
                gets.  This is the default value if AccountFilterType  is  not
                provided.  This  enables user to update an entire OU and indi-
                vidual accounts from a different OU in one request, which used
                to be two separate requests.

              o NONE : Deploys to all the accounts in specified organizational
                units (OU).

          }

       --permission-model (string)
          Describes how the IAM roles required for stack  set  operations  are
          created.  You  cannot  modify PermissionModel if there are stack in-
          stances associated with your stack set.

          o With self-managed permissions, you must create  the  administrator
            and  execution  roles  required  to deploy to target accounts. For
            more information, see Grant Self-Managed Stack Set Permissions .

          o With service-managed permissions, StackSets automatically  creates
            the  IAM roles required to deploy to accounts managed by Organiza-
            tions. For more information, see Grant Service-Managed  Stack  Set
            Permissions .

          Possible values:

          o SERVICE_MANAGED

          o SELF_MANAGED

       --auto-deployment (structure)
          [Service-managed  permissions] Describes whether StackSets automati-
          cally deploys to Organizations accounts that are added to  a  target
          organization or organizational unit (OU).

          If  you  specify AutoDeployment , don't specify DeploymentTargets or
          Regions .

          Enabled -> (boolean)
              If set to true  ,  StackSets  automatically  deploys  additional
              stack  instances  to  Organizations accounts that are added to a
              target organization or organizational unit (OU) in the specified
              Regions.  If an account is removed from a target organization or
              OU, StackSets deletes stack instances from the  account  in  the
              specified Regions.

          RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval -> (boolean)
              If set to true , stack resources are retained when an account is
              removed from a target organization or OU.  If  set  to  false  ,
              stack  resources  are deleted. Specify only if Enabled is set to
              True .

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Enabled=boolean,RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Enabled": true|false,
            "RetainStacksOnAccountRemoval": true|false
          }

       --operation-id (string)
          The unique ID for this stack set operation.

          The operation ID also functions as an idempotency token,  to  ensure
          that CloudFormation performs the stack set operation only once, even
          if you retry the request multiple times. You might retry  stack  set
          operation  requests  to  ensure that CloudFormation successfully re-
          ceived them.

          If you don't specify an operation ID, CloudFormation  generates  one
          automatically.

          Repeating  this  stack set operation with a new operation ID retries
          all stack instances whose status is OUTDATED .

       --accounts (list)
          [Self-managed permissions] The accounts in which to  update  associ-
          ated stack instances. If you specify accounts, you must also specify
          the Amazon Web Services Regions in which to  update  stack  set  in-
          stances.

          To  update  all  the stack instances associated with this stack set,
          don't specify the Accounts or Regions properties.

          If the stack set update includes changes to the template  (that  is,
          if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
          Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a
          status  of  OUTDATED  prior  to  updating the stack instances in the
          specified accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions. If the stack set
          update  does  not  include  changes  to  the template or parameters,
          CloudFormation updates the stack instances in the specified accounts
          and  Amazon  Web Services Regions, while leaving all other stack in-
          stances with their existing stack instance status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --regions (list)
          The Amazon Web Services Regions in which to update associated  stack
          instances. If you specify Regions, you must also specify accounts in
          which to update stack set instances.

          To update all the stack instances associated with this stack set, do
          not specify the Accounts or Regions properties.

          If  the  stack set update includes changes to the template (that is,
          if the TemplateBody or TemplateURL properties are specified), or the
          Parameters property, CloudFormation marks all stack instances with a
          status of OUTDATED prior to updating  the  stack  instances  in  the
          specified accounts and Regions. If the stack set update does not in-
          clude changes to the template or parameters, CloudFormation  updates
          the  stack  instances  in  the specified accounts and Regions, while
          leaving all other stack instances with their existing stack instance
          status.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --managed-execution (structure)
          Describes whether StackSets performs non-conflicting operations con-
          currently and queues conflicting operations.

          Active -> (boolean)
              When  true  , StackSets performs non-conflicting operations con-
              currently and queues conflicting operations.  After  conflicting
              operations finish, StackSets starts queued operations in request
              order.

              NOTE:
                 If there are already running or queued operations,  StackSets
                 queues all incoming operations even if they are non-conflict-
                 ing.

                 You can't modify your  stack  set's  execution  configuration
                 while  there  are running or queued operations for that stack
                 set.

              When false (default), StackSets performs one operation at a time
              in request order.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Active=boolean

       JSON Syntax:

          {
            "Active": true|false
          }

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS  services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To use the following examples, you must have the AWS  CLI  installed
          and  configured.  See  the Getting started guide in the AWS CLI User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like  quotation
          rules.  These  examples  will  need to be adapted to your terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To update a stack set

       The  following  update-stack-set  example  adds a tag with the key name
       Owner and a value of IT to the stack instances in the  specified  stack
       set.

          aws cloudformation update-stack-set \
              --stack-set-name my-stack-set \
              --use-previous-template \
              --tags Key=Owner,Value=IT

       Output:

          {
              "OperationId": "e2b60321-6cab-xmpl-bde7-530c6f47950e"
          }

OUTPUT
       OperationId -> (string)
          The unique ID for this stack set operation.
