CREATE-CHANGE-SET()                                        CREATE-CHANGE-SET()



NAME
       create-change-set -

DESCRIPTION
       Creates  a  list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you
       can review the changes before executing them. You can create  a  change
       set  for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create
       a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set  shows  all
       of  the  resources  that  CloudFormation  will  create. If you create a
       change set for an existing stack, CloudFormation compares  the  stack's
       information  with the information that you submit in the change set and
       lists the differences. Use change sets to  understand  which  resources
       CloudFormation  will create or change, and how it will change resources
       in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.

       To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the  Change-
       SetType  parameter,  specify CREATE . To create a change set for an ex-
       isting stack, specify UPDATE for the ChangeSetType parameter. To create
       a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT for the ChangeSet-
       Type parameter. After the CreateChangeSet call successfully  completes,
       CloudFormation  starts  creating the change set. To check the status of
       the change set or to review it, use the  DescribeChangeSet action.

       When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make,  exe-
       cute  the change set by using the  ExecuteChangeSet action. CloudForma-
       tion doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.

       To create a change set for the entire stack hierarchy, set IncludeNest-
       edStacks to True .

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name or the unique ID of the stack for which you are creating a
          change set. CloudFormation generates the  change  set  by  comparing
          this  stack's information with the information that you submit, such
          as a modified template or different parameter input values.

       --template-body (string)
          A structure that contains the body of the revised template,  with  a
          minimum  length  of  1  byte  and  a maximum length of 51,200 bytes.
          CloudFormation generates the change set by comparing  this  template
          with the template of the stack that you specified.

          Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL .

       --template-url (string)
          The location of the file that contains the revised template. The URL
          must point to a template (max size: 460,800 bytes) that's located in
          an  Amazon  S3  bucket or a Systems Manager document. CloudFormation
          generates the change set by comparing this template with  the  stack
          that  you specified. The location for an Amazon S3 bucket must start
          with https:// .

          Conditional: You must specify only TemplateBody or TemplateURL .

       --use-previous-template | --no-use-previous-template (boolean)
          Whether to reuse the template that's associated with  the  stack  to
          create the change set.

       --parameters (list)
          A list of Parameter structures that specify input parameters for the
          change set. For more information, see the  Parameter data type.

          (structure)
              The Parameter data type.

              ParameterKey -> (string)
                 The key associated with the parameter. If you don't specify a
                 key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses
                 the default value that's specified in your template.

              ParameterValue -> (string)
                 The input value associated with the parameter.

              UsePreviousValue -> (boolean)
                 During a stack update, use the existing parameter value  that
                 the  stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify
                 true , do not specify a parameter value.

              ResolvedValue -> (string)
                 Read-only. The value that corresponds to a SSM parameter key.
                 This  field  is  returned only for SSM parameter types in the
                 template.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ParameterKey=string,ParameterValue=string,UsePreviousValue=boolean,ResolvedValue=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ParameterKey": "string",
              "ParameterValue": "string",
              "UsePreviousValue": true|false,
              "ResolvedValue": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --capabilities (list)
          In some cases, you must explicitly acknowledge that your stack  tem-
          plate  contains  certain capabilities in order for CloudFormation to
          create the stack.

          o CAPABILITY_IAM and  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM    Some  stack  templates
            might include resources that can affect permissions in your Amazon
            Web Services account; for example, by creating  new  Identity  and
            Access  Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explic-
            itly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The
            following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABIL-
            ITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.

            o If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.

            o If you have IAM resources with custom names,  you  must  specify
              CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .

            o If  you  don't specify either of these capabilities, CloudForma-
              tion returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.

          If your stack template contains these resources, we suggest that you
          review  all  permissions associated with them and edit their permis-
          sions if necessary.

          tion templates .

          o CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND   Some template contain macros. Macros per-
            form custom processing on templates; this can include  simple  ac-
            tions  like  find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive
            transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users  typi-
            cally  create  a  change  set from the processed template, so that
            they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actu-
            ally  creating  the  stack. If your stack template contains one or
            more macros, and you choose to create a stack  directly  from  the
            processed  template, without first reviewing the resulting changes
            in a change set, you must acknowledge this  capability.  This  in-
            cludes               the               `              AWS::Include
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/create-reusable-transform-function-snippets-and-add-to-your-template-with-aws-include-transform.html`__
            and                        `                       AWS::Serverless
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/transform-aws-serverless.html`__
            transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.

          NOTE:
                 This  capacity  doesn't  apply  to  creating change sets, and
                 specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you
                 want  to  create  a stack from a stack template that contains
                 macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack
                 directly  from the template using the  CreateStack or  Updat-
                 eStack action, and specifying this capability.

              macros to perform custom processing on templates .

          NOTE:
              Only  one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can be
              specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

          Where valid values are:
            CAPABILITY_IAM
            CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
            CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND

       --resource-types (list)
          The template resource types that you have permissions to  work  with
          if  you  execute  this  change  set,  such  as  AWS::EC2::Instance ,
          AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance .

          If the list of resource types doesn't include a resource  type  that
          you're  updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation
          grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and  Access  Man-
          agement (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies
          for CloudFormation. For more  information,  see  Controlling  access
          with Identity and Access Management in the CloudFormation User Guide
          .

          NOTE:
              Only one of the Capabilities and ResourceType parameters can  be
              specified.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --role-arn (string)
          The  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes  when  executing  the  change
          set.  CloudFormation  uses  the  role's credentials to make calls on
          your behalf. CloudFormation uses this role for all future operations
          on  the stack. Provided that users have permission to operate on the
          stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the  users  don't  have
          permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least permission.

          If  you don't specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was
          previously associated with the  stack.  If  no  role  is  available,
          CloudFormation  uses a temporary session that is generated from your
          user credentials.

       --rollback-configuration (structure)
          The rollback triggers for CloudFormation  to  monitor  during  stack
          creation  and  updating operations, and for the specified monitoring
          period afterwards.

          RollbackTriggers -> (list)
              The triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.

              By default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified
              for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations
              for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you  do  specify
              rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any
              list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:

              o To use the rollback triggers  previously  specified  for  this
                stack, if any, don't specify this parameter.

              o To  specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify
                all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even trig-
                gers  you've  specified before (for example, when creating the
                stack or during a previous stack update).  Any  triggers  that
                you  don't  include  in  the  updated  list of triggers are no
                longer applied to the stack.

              o To remove all currently specified triggers, specify  an  empty
                list for this parameter.

              If  a  specified  trigger is missing, the entire stack operation
              fails and is rolled back.

              (structure)
                 A rollback trigger CloudFormation  monitors  during  creation
                 and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes
                 to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the spec-
                 ified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back
                 the entire stack operation.

                 Arn -> (string)
                     The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.

                     If a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack oper-
                     ation fails and is rolled back.

                 Type -> (string)
                     The resource type of the rollback trigger. Specify either
                     `                                  AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-cw-alarm.html`__
                     or           `            AWS::CloudWatch::CompositeAlarm
                     https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cloudwatch-compositealarm.html`__
                     resource types.

          MonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)
              The amount of time,  in  minutes,  during  which  CloudFormation
              should  monitor  all  the rollback triggers after the stack cre-
              ation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.

              The default is 0 minutes.

              If you specify a monitoring period but don't specify  any  roll-
              back  triggers,  CloudFormation still waits the specified period
              of time before cleaning up old  resources  after  update  opera-
              tions.  You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual
              stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation
              or        update        (using        `        CancelUpdateStack
              https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_CancelUpdateStack.html`__
              , for example) as necessary.

              If  you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still moni-
              tors the specified rollback triggers during stack  creation  and
              update  operations.  Then, for update operations, it begins dis-
              posing of old resources  immediately  once  the  operation  com-
              pletes.

          {
            "RollbackTriggers": [
              {

            ],
            "MonitoringTimeInMinutes": integer
          }

       --notification-arns (list)
          The  Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Ser-
          vice (Amazon SNS) topics that  CloudFormation  associates  with  the
          stack.  To  remove  all  associated  notification topics, specify an
          empty list.

          (string)

       Syntax:

          "string" "string" ...

       --tags (list)
          Key-value pairs to associate with this  stack.  CloudFormation  also
          propagates  these  tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a
          maximum of 50 tags.

          (structure)
              The Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be
              used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.

              Key -> (string)
                 Required  . A string used to identify this tag. You can spec-
                 ify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned  by
                 Amazon  Web  Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved
                 prefix: aws: .

              Value -> (string)
                 Required . A string containing the value for  this  tag.  You
                 can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Key=string,Value=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Key": "string",
              "Value": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --change-set-name (string)
          The name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change
          sets that are associated with the specified stack.

          A change set name can  contain  only  alphanumeric,  case  sensitive
          characters,  and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetical charac-
          ter and can't exceed 128 characters.

       --client-token (string)
          A unique identifier for this CreateChangeSet request.  Specify  this
          token  if  you  plan  to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows
          that you're not attempting to create another  change  set  with  the
          same  name.  You might retry CreateChangeSet requests to ensure that
          CloudFormation successfully received them.

       --description (string)
          A description to help you identify this change set.

       --change-set-type (string)
          The type of change set operation. To create a change set for  a  new
          stack,  specify  CREATE  .  To  create  a change set for an existing
          stack, specify UPDATE . To create a change set for an import  opera-
          tion, specify IMPORT .

          If you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a
          stack with a unique stack ID, but  no  template  or  resources.  The
          stack  will be in the REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS state until you execute the
          change set.

          By default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE . You can't use the  UP-
          DATE  type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type
          to create a change set for an existing stack.

          Possible values:

          o CREATE

          o UPDATE

          o IMPORT

       --resources-to-import (list)
          The resources to import into your stack.

          (structure)
              Describes the target resource of an import operation.

              ResourceType -> (string)
                 The type of resource to  import  into  your  stack,  such  as
                 AWS::S3::Bucket . For a list of supported resource types, see
                 Resources that support import operations in  the  CloudForma-
                 tion User Guide.

              LogicalResourceId -> (string)
                 The  logical  ID  of  the target resource as specified in the
                 template.

              ResourceIdentifier -> (map)
                 A key-value pair that identifies the target resource. The key
                 is  an  identifier  property  (for  example,  BucketName  for
                 AWS::S3::Bucket resources) and the value is the actual  prop-
                 erty value (for example, MyS3Bucket ).

                 key -> (string)

                 value -> (string)

       Shorthand Syntax:

          ResourceType=string,LogicalResourceId=string,ResourceIdentifier={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "ResourceType": "string",
              "LogicalResourceId": "string",
              "ResourceIdentifier": {"string": "string"
                ...}
            }
            ...
          ]

       --include-nested-stacks | --no-include-nested-stacks (boolean)
          Creates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the tem-
          plate. The default behavior of this action is set to False . To  in-
          clude nested sets in a change set, specify True .

       --on-stack-failure (string)
          Determines  what  action  will  be taken if stack creation fails. If
          this parameter is specified, the DisableRollback parameter to the  `
          ExecuteChangeSet
          https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html`__
          API  operation must not be specified. This must be one of these val-
          ues:

          o DELETE - Deletes the change set if the stack creation fails.  This
            is  only valid when the ChangeSetType parameter is set to CREATE .
            If the deletion of the stack fails, the status  of  the  stack  is
            DELETE_FAILED .

          o DO_NOTHING  -  if  the  stack  creation fails, do nothing. This is
            equivalent to specifying true for the DisableRollback parameter to
            the                       `                       ExecuteChangeSet
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html`__
            API operation.

          o ROLLBACK  - if the stack creation fails, roll back the stack. This
            is equivalent to specifying false for the DisableRollback  parame-
            ter           to          the          `          ExecuteChangeSet
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_ExecuteChangeSet.html`__
            API operation.

          For  nested  stacks,  when  the  OnStackFailure  parameter is set to
          DELETE for the change set for the parent stack,  any  failure  in  a
          child  stack  will  cause  the parent stack creation to fail and all
          stacks to be deleted.

          Possible values:

          o DO_NOTHING

          o ROLLBACK

          o DELETE

       --import-existing-resources | --no-import-existing-resources (boolean)
          Indicates if the change set imports resources that already exist.

          NOTE:
              This parameter can only import resources that have custom  names
              in  templates. For more information, see name type in the Cloud-
              Formation User Guide . To import resources that  do  not  accept
              custom  names,  such  as  EC2 instances, use the resource import
              feature instead. For more information, see Bringing existing re-
              sources  into  CloudFormation  management  in the CloudFormation
              User Guide .

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. If provided with the value output,  it  validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       --debug (boolean)

       Turn on debug logging.

       --endpoint-url (string)

       Override command's default URL with the given URL.

       --no-verify-ssl (boolean)

       By  default, the AWS CLI uses SSL when communicating with AWS services.
       For each SSL connection, the AWS CLI will verify SSL certificates. This
       option overrides the default behavior of verifying SSL certificates.

       --no-paginate (boolean)

       Disable automatic pagination.

       --output (string)

       The formatting style for command output.

       o json

       o text

       o table

       --query (string)

       A JMESPath query to use in filtering the response data.

       --profile (string)

       Use a specific profile from your credential file.

       --region (string)

       The region to use. Overrides config/env settings.

       --version (string)

       Display the version of this tool.

       --color (string)

       Turn on/off color output.

       o on

       o off

       o auto

       --no-sign-request (boolean)

       Do  not  sign requests. Credentials will not be loaded if this argument
       is provided.

       --ca-bundle (string)

       The CA certificate bundle to use when verifying SSL certificates. Over-
       rides config/env settings.

       --cli-read-timeout (int)

       The  maximum socket read time in seconds. If the value is set to 0, the
       socket read will be blocking and not timeout. The default value  is  60
       seconds.

       --cli-connect-timeout (int)

       The  maximum  socket connect time in seconds. If the value is set to 0,
       the socket connect will be blocking and not timeout. The default  value
       is 60 seconds.

EXAMPLES
       NOTE:
          To  use  the following examples, you must have the AWS CLI installed
          and configured. See the Getting started guide in the  AWS  CLI  User
          Guide for more information.

          Unless  otherwise  stated,  all  examples  have  unix-like quotation
          rules. These examples will need to be  adapted  to  your  terminal's
          quoting rules. See Using quotation marks with strings in the AWS CLI
          User Guide .

       To create a change set

       The following create-change-set example creates a change set  with  the
       CAPABILITY_IAM capability. The file template.yaml is an AWS CloudForma-
       tion template in the current folder that defines a stack that  includes
       IAM resources.

          aws cloudformation create-change-set \
              --stack-name my-application \
              --change-set-name my-change-set \
              --template-body file://template.yaml \
              --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

       Output:

          {
              "Id": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:changeSet/my-change-set/bc9555ba-a949-xmpl-bfb8-f41d04ec5784",
              "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-application/d0a825a0-e4cd-xmpl-b9fb-061c69e99204"
          }

OUTPUT
       Id -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the change set.

       StackId -> (string)
          The unique ID of the stack.
