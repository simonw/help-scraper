NAME
       list-stack-set-operation-results -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns summary information about the results of a stack set operation.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-set-operation-results is a paginated operation. Multiple API
       calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire  data  set  of  re-
       sults.  You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argu-
       ment.  When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated
       response,  the  --query  argument must extract data from the results of
       the following query expressions: Summaries

SYNOPSIS
            list-stack-set-operation-results
          --stack-set-name <value>
          --operation-id <value>
          [--call-as <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--page-size <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The name or unique ID of the stack set that you want to  get  opera-
          tion results for.

       --operation-id (string)
          The ID of the stack set operation.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list stack set operation results

       The following command displays the results of an  update  operation  on
       instances in the specified stack set.

          aws cloudformation list-stack-set-operation-results \
              --stack-set-name enable-config \
              --operation-id 35d45ebc-ed88-xmpl-ab59-0197a1fc83a0

       Output:

          {
              "Summaries": [
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "us-west-2",
                      "Status": "SUCCEEDED",
                      "AccountGateResult": {
                          "Status": "SKIPPED",
                          "StatusReason": "Function not found: arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:223456789012:function:AWSCloudFormationStackSetAccountGate"
                      }
                  },
                  {
                      "Account": "223456789012",
                      "Region": "ap-south-1",
                      "Status": "CANCELLED",
                      "StatusReason": "Cancelled since failure tolerance has exceeded"
                  }
              ]
          }

       Note: The SKIPPED status for AccountGateResult is expected for success-
       ful operations unless you create an account gate function.

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of StackSetOperationResultSummary structures that contain in-
          formation  about  the  specified operation results, for accounts and
          Amazon Web Services Regions that are included in the operation.

          (structure)
              The structure that contains information about a specified opera-
              tion's results for a given account in a given Region.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed  permissions]  The  name of the Amazon Web Ser-
                 vices account for this operation result.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region for this operation
                 result.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  result  status  of the stack set operation for the given
                 account in the given Region.

                 o CANCELLED : The operation in the specified account and  Re-
                   gion  has  been canceled. This is either because a user has
                   stopped the stack set operation,  or  because  the  failure
                   tolerance of the stack set operation has been exceeded.

                 o FAILED  : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough accounts
                   within  a  Region,  the failure tolerance for the stack set
                   operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                 o RUNNING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   is currently in progress.

                 o PENDING : The operation in the specified account and Region
                   has yet to start.

                 o SUCCEEDED : The operation in the specified account and  Re-
                   gion completed successfully.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The reason for the assigned result status.

              AccountGateResult -> (structure)
                 The  results  of the account gate function CloudFormation in-
                 vokes, if present, before proceeding with  stack  set  opera-
                 tions in an account.

                 Status -> (string)
                     The status of the account gate function.

                     o SUCCEEDED  :  The  account gate function has determined
                       that the account and Region passes any requirements for
                       a stack set operation to occur. CloudFormation proceeds
                       with the stack operation in that account and Region.

                     o FAILED : The account gate function has determined  that
                       the  account  and  Region doesn't meet the requirements
                       for a stack set operation to occur. CloudFormation can-
                       cels  the  stack  set operation in that account and Re-
                       gion, and sets the stack set  operation  result  status
                       for that account and Region to FAILED .

                     o SKIPPED  :  CloudFormation  has skipped calling the ac-
                       count gate function for this account  and  Region,  for
                       one of the following reasons:

                       o An  account  gate  function hasn't been specified for
                         the account and Region. CloudFormation proceeds  with
                         the stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o The   AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole  of  the
                         stack set administration account lacks permissions to
                         invoke the function. CloudFormation proceeds with the
                         stack set operation in this account and Region.

                       o Either no action is necessary, or no action is possi-
                         ble, on the stack. CloudFormation skips the stack set
                         operation in this account and Region.

                 StatusReason -> (string)
                     The reason for the account gate status assigned  to  this
                     account and Region for the stack set operation.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or or-
                 ganizational  unit  (OU)   IDs   that   you   specified   for
                 DeploymentTargets .

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all results, NextToken is set to a to-
          ken. To retrieve the next set of results, call  ListOperationResults
          again and assign that token to the request object's NextToken param-
          eter. If there are no remaining results, NextToken is set to null .
