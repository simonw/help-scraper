LIST-IMPORTS()                                                  LIST-IMPORTS()



NAME
       list-imports -

DESCRIPTION
       Lists all stacks that are importing an exported output value. To modify
       or remove an exported output value, first use this action to see  which
       stacks are using it. To see the exported output values in your account,
       see  ListExports .

       For more information about importing an exported output value, see  the
       `                                                       Fn::ImportValue

       function.

       list-imports is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued
       in order to retrieve the entire data set of results.  You  can  disable
       pagination  by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using --out-
       put text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the  --query
       argument  must extract data from the results of the following query ex-
       pressions: Imports

SYNOPSIS
            list-imports
          --export-name <value>
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--starting-token <value>]
          [--max-items <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --export-name (string)
          The name of the exported output value.  CloudFormation  returns  the
          stack names that are importing this value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the  NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To list imports

       The following list-imports example lists the  stacks  that  import  the
       specified  export.  To  get  the  list  of  available  exports, use the
       list-exports command.

          aws cloudformation list-imports \
              --export-name private-vpc-vpcid

       Output:

          {
              "Imports": [
                  "my-database-stack"
              ]
          }

OUTPUT
       Imports -> (list)
          A list of stack names that are importing the specified exported out-
          put value.

          (string)

       NextToken -> (string)
          A  string  that  identifies the next page of exports. If there is no
          additional page, this value is null.
