TEST-TYPE()                                                        TEST-TYPE()



NAME
       test-type -

DESCRIPTION
       Tests  a  registered  extension to make sure it meets all necessary re-
       quirements for being published in the CloudFormation registry.

       o For resource types, this includes passing all contracts tests defined
         for the type.

       o For  modules,  this  includes determining if the module's model meets
         all necessary requirements.

       For more information, see Testing your public extension prior  to  pub-
       lishing in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       If  you  do not specify a version, CloudFormation uses the default ver-
       sion of the extension in your account and region for testing.

       To perform testing, CloudFormation assumes the execution role specified
       when the type was registered. For more information, see RegisterType .

       Once  you've initiated testing on an extension using TestType , you can
       use DescribeType to monitor the current test status and test status de-
       scription for the extension.

       An  extension  must  have a test status of PASSED before it can be pub-
       lished. For more information, see Publishing extensions  to  make  them
       available for public use in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

SYNOPSIS
            test-type
          [--arn <value>]
          [--type <value>]
          [--type-name <value>]
          [--version-id <value>]
          [--log-delivery-bucket <value>]
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --arn (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the extension.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --type (string)
          The type of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

          Possible values:

          o RESOURCE

          o MODULE

       --type-name (string)
          The name of the extension to test.

          Conditional: You must specify Arn , or TypeName and Type .

       --version-id (string)
          The version of the extension to test.

          You  can  specify  the version id with either Arn , or with TypeName
          and Type .

          If you do not specify a version,  CloudFormation  uses  the  default
          version of the extension in this account and region for testing.

       --log-delivery-bucket (string)
          The S3 bucket to which CloudFormation delivers the contract test ex-
          ecution logs.

          CloudFormation delivers the logs by the time  contract  testing  has
          completed  and the extension has been assigned a test type status of
          PASSED or FAILED .

          The user calling TestType must be able to access items in the speci-
          fied  S3  bucket. Specifically, the user needs the following permis-
          sions:

          o GetObject

          o PutObject

          For more information, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for
          Amazon  S3 in the Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management
          User Guide .

       --cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments  from  the
       JSON  string  provided.  The JSON string follows the format provided by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line,  those  values  will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the  string  will  be  taken literally. This may not be specified along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.  If  provided
       with  the  value  output, it validates the command inputs and returns a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To test an extension

       The following test-type example tests a registered  extension  to  make
       sure  it  meets  all  necessary requirements for being published in the
       CloudFormation registry.

          aws cloudformation test-type \
              --arn arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001

       Output:

          {
              "TypeVersionArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/resource/Sample-Test-Resource123/00000001"
          }

       For more information, see Using the AWS CloudFormation registry in  the
       AWS CloudFormation User Guide.

OUTPUT
       TypeVersionArn -> (string)
          The Amazon Resource Number (ARN) of the extension.
