DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()                    DETECT-STACK-RESOURCE-DRIFT()



NAME
       detect-stack-resource-drift -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  information  about  whether  a resource's actual configuration
       differs, or has drifted , from it's expected configuration, as  defined
       in  the stack template and any values specified as template parameters.
       This information includes actual and expected property values  for  re-
       sources in which CloudFormation detects drift. Only resource properties
       explicitly defined in the stack template are  checked  for  drift.  For
       more  information about stack and resource drift, see Detecting Unregu-
       lated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

       Use DetectStackResourceDrift to detect drift on  individual  resources,
       or   DetectStackDrift to detect drift on all resources in a given stack
       that support drift detection.

       Resources that do not  currently  support  drift  detection  cannot  be
       checked.  For  a  list  of  resources that support drift detection, see
       Resources that Support Drift Detection .

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            detect-stack-resource-drift
          --stack-name <value>
          --logical-resource-id <value>
          [--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The name of the stack to which the resource belongs.

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource for which to return drift  informa-
          tion.

       --cli-input-json  |  --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the
       JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the  format  provided  by
       --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command
       line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.  It  is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally. This may  not  be  specified  along
       with --cli-input-yaml.

       --generate-cli-skeleton  (string)  Prints  a  JSON skeleton to standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a
       sample  input  YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided
       with the value output, it validates the command inputs  and  returns  a
       sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES
       To detect drift for a resource

       The  following  detect-stack-resource-drift  example  checks a resource
       named MyFunction in a stack named MyStack for drift:

          aws cloudformation detect-stack-resource-drift \
             --stack-name MyStack \
             --logical-resource-id MyFunction

       The output shows an AWS Lambda function that was modified out-of-band:

OUTPUT
       StackResourceDrift -> (structure)
          Information about whether the resource's  actual  configuration  has
          drifted  from  its expected template configuration, including actual
          and expected property values and any differences detected.

          StackId -> (string)
              The ID of the stack.

          LogicalResourceId -> (string)
              The logical name of the resource specified in the template.

          PhysicalResourceId -> (string)
              The name or unique identifier that corresponds to a physical in-
              stance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          PhysicalResourceIdContext -> (list)
              Context  information  that  enables  CloudFormation  to uniquely
              identify a resource. CloudFormation uses context key-value pairs
              in  cases  where  a  resource's logical and physical IDs are not
              enough  to  uniquely  identify  that  resource.   Each   context
              key-value  pair  specifies  a  unique resource that contains the
              targeted resource.

              (structure)
                 Context information that enables CloudFormation  to  uniquely
                 identify  a  resource.  CloudFormation uses context key-value
                 pairs in cases where a resource's logical  and  physical  IDs
                 are  not enough to uniquely identify that resource. Each con-
                 text key-value pair specifies a resource  that  contains  the
                 targeted resource.

                 Key -> (string)
                     The resource context key.

                 Value -> (string)
                     The resource context value.

          ResourceType -> (string)
              The type of the resource.

          ExpectedProperties -> (string)
              A  JSON structure containing the expected property values of the
              stack resource, as defined in the stack template and any  values
              specified as template parameters.

              For  resources  whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED , this
              structure will not be present.

          ActualProperties -> (string)
              A JSON structure containing the actual property  values  of  the
              stack resource.

              For  resources  whose StackResourceDriftStatus is DELETED , this
              structure will not be present.

          PropertyDifferences -> (list)
              A collection of the resource properties whose actual values dif-
              fer  from  their expected values. These will be present only for
              resources whose StackResourceDriftStatus is MODIFIED .

              (structure)
                 Information about a resource property whose actual value dif-
                 fers  from  its  expected value, as defined in the stack tem-
                 plate and any values specified as template parameters.  These
                 will  be present only for resources whose StackResourceDrift-
                 Status is MODIFIED . For more information, see Detecting  Un-
                 regulated Configuration Changes to Stacks and Resources .

                 ExpectedValue -> (string)
                     The  expected property value of the resource property, as
                     defined in the stack template and any values specified as
                     template parameters.

                 ActualValue -> (string)
                     The actual property value of the resource property.

                     o ADD  :  A  value  has been added to a resource property
                       that is an array or list data type.

                     o REMOVE : The property has been removed from the current
                       resource configuration.

                     o NOT_EQUAL : The current property value differs from its
                       expected value (as defined in the  stack  template  and
                       any values specified as template parameters).

          StackResourceDriftStatus -> (string)
              Status  of  the  resource's actual configuration compared to its
              expected configuration

              o DELETED : The resource differs from its expected template con-
                figuration because the resource has been deleted.

              o MODIFIED  :  One or more resource properties differ from their
                expected values (as defined in the stack template and any val-
                ues specified as template parameters).

              o IN_SYNC : The resources's actual configuration matches its ex-
                pected template configuration.

              o NOT_CHECKED : CloudFormation does not  currently  return  this
                value.

          Timestamp -> (timestamp)
              Time  at  which  CloudFormation performed drift detection on the
              stack resource.

          ModuleInfo -> (structure)
              Contains information about the module from  which  the  resource
              was  created, if the resource was created from a module included
              in the stack template.

              TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the the module type or types contain-
                 ing  the  resource. Module types are listed starting with the
                 inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In the following example, the resource  was  created  from  a
                 module  of  type AWS::First::Example::MODULE , that is nested
                 inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .
                     AWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE

              LogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)
                 A concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or mod-
                 ules  containing  the  resource.  Modules are listed starting
                 with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                 In the following example, the resource  was  created  from  a
                 module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent module, mod-
                 uleB .
                     moduleA/moduleB
