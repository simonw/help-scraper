LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()                                  LIST-STACK-INSTANCES()



NAME
       list-stack-instances -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  summary  information about stack instances that are associated
       with the specified stack set. You can filter for stack  instances  that
       are  associated with a specific Amazon Web Services account name or Re-
       gion, or that have a specific status.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

       list-stack-instances is a paginated operation. Multiple API  calls  may
       be  issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can
       disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument.  When using
       --output  text  and  the  --query argument on a paginated response, the
       --query argument must extract data from the results  of  the  following
       query expressions: Summaries

OPTIONS
       --stack-set-name (string)
          The  name  or unique ID of the stack set that you want to list stack
          instances for.

       --filters (list)
          The status that stack instances are filtered by.

          (structure)
              The status that stack instances are filtered by.

              Name -> (string)
                 The type of filter to apply.

              Values -> (string)
                 The status to filter by.

       Shorthand Syntax:

          Name=string,Values=string ...

       JSON Syntax:

          [
            {
              "Name": "DETAILED_STATUS",
              "Values": "string"
            }
            ...
          ]

       --stack-instance-account (string)
          The name of the Amazon Web Services account that you  want  to  list
          stack instances for.

       --stack-instance-region (string)
          The name of the Region where you want to list stack instances.

       --call-as (string)
          [Service-managed permissions] Specifies whether you are acting as an
          account administrator in the organization's management account or as
          a delegated administrator in a member account.

          By  default,  SELF  is  specified.  Use  SELF  for  stack  sets with
          self-managed permissions.

          o If you are signed in to the management account, specify SELF .

          o If you are signed in to a delegated administrator account, specify
            DELEGATED_ADMIN  . Your Amazon Web Services account must be regis-
            tered as a delegated administrator in the management account.  For
            more  information,  see  Register a delegated administrator in the
            CloudFormation User Guide .

          Possible values:

          o SELF

          o DELEGATED_ADMIN

       --cli-input-json (string) Performs service operation based on the  JSON
       string  provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments  are  provided  on  the  command
       line,  the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --starting-token (string)
          A  token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken
          from a previously truncated response.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --page-size (integer)
          The  size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not
          affect the number of items returned in the command's output. Setting
          a  smaller  page  size results in more calls to the AWS service, re-
          trieving fewer items in each call. This can  help  prevent  the  AWS
          service calls from timing out.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --max-items (integer)
          The total number of items to return in the command's output. If  the
          total  number of items available is more than the value specified, a
          NextToken is provided in the command's output. To resume pagination,
          provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a sub-
          sequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element  directly
          outside of the AWS CLI.

          For usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface
          User Guide .

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

EXAMPLES

OUTPUT
       Summaries -> (list)
          A list of StackInstanceSummary structures that  contain  information
          about the specified stack instances.

          (structure)
              The  structure  that  contains summary information about a stack
              instance.

              StackSetId -> (string)
                 The name or unique ID of the stack set  that  the  stack  in-
                 stance is associated with.

              Region -> (string)
                 The name of the Amazon Web Services Region that the stack in-
                 stance is associated with.

              Account -> (string)
                 [Self-managed permissions] The name of the  Amazon  Web  Ser-
                 vices account that the stack instance is associated with.

              StackId -> (string)
                 The ID of the stack instance.

              Status -> (string)
                 The  status  of  the stack instance, in terms of its synchro-
                 nization with its associated stack set.

                 o INOPERABLE : A DeleteStackInstances  operation  has  failed
                   and  left  the  stack  in an unstable state. Stacks in this
                   state are excluded from further UpdateStackSet  operations.
                   You might need to perform a DeleteStackInstances operation,
                   with RetainStacks set to true , to  delete  the  stack  in-
                   stance, and then delete the stack manually.

                 o OUTDATED  :  The  stack isn't currently up to date with the
                   stack set because:

                   o The associated stack failed during  a  CreateStackSet  or
                     UpdateStackSet operation.

                   o The  stack was part of a CreateStackSet or UpdateStackSet
                     operation that failed or was stopped before the stack was
                     created or updated.

                 o CURRENT  : The stack is currently up to date with the stack
                   set.

              StatusReason -> (string)
                 The explanation for the specific status code assigned to this
                 stack instance.

              StackInstanceStatus -> (structure)
                 The detailed status of the stack instance.

                 DetailedStatus -> (string)

                     o CANCELLED  : The operation in the specified account and
                       Region has been cancelled. This  is  either  because  a
                       user  has  stopped  the stack set operation, or because
                       the failure tolerance of the stack  set  operation  has
                       been exceeded.

                     o FAILED : The operation in the specified account and Re-
                       gion failed. If the stack set operation fails in enough
                       accounts within a Region, the failure tolerance for the
                       stack set operation as a whole might be exceeded.

                     o INOPERABLE  :  A  DeleteStackInstances  operation   has
                       failed  and left the stack in an unstable state. Stacks
                       in this state are excluded from further  UpdateStackSet
                       operations.  You might need to perform a DeleteStackIn-
                       stances operation, with RetainStacks set to true  ,  to
                       delete  the  stack  instance, and then delete the stack
                       manually.

                     o PENDING : The operation in the  specified  account  and
                       Region has yet to start.

                     o RUNNING  :  The  operation in the specified account and
                       Region is currently in progress.

                     o SUCCEEDED : The operation in the specified account  and
                       Region completed successfully.

              OrganizationalUnitId -> (string)
                 [Service-managed permissions] The organization root ID or or-
                 ganizational  unit  (OU)   IDs   that   you   specified   for
                 DeploymentTargets .

              DriftStatus -> (string)
                 Status  of the stack instance's actual configuration compared
                 to the expected template and parameter configuration  of  the
                 stack set to which it belongs.

                 o DRIFTED  : The stack differs from the expected template and
                   parameter configuration of the stack set to  which  it  be-
                   longs.  A  stack  instance is considered to have drifted if
                   one or more of the resources in the associated  stack  have
                   drifted.

                 o NOT_CHECKED  :  CloudFormation has not checked if the stack
                   instance differs from its expected stack set configuration.

                 o IN_SYNC : The stack instance's actual configuration matches
                   its expected stack set configuration.

                 o UNKNOWN : This value is reserved for future use.

              LastDriftCheckTimestamp -> (timestamp)
                 Most recent time when CloudFormation performed a drift detec-
                 tion operation on the stack instance. This value will be NULL
                 for  any  stack instance on which drift detection has not yet
                 been performed.

       NextToken -> (string)
          If the request doesn't return all of the remaining results,  NextTo-
          ken  is  set  to  a token. To retrieve the next set of results, call
          ListStackInstances again and assign that token to  the  request  ob-
          ject's  NextToken  parameter.  If  the  request returns all results,
          NextToken is set to null .
