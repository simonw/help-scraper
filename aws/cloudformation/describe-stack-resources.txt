DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()                          DESCRIBE-STACK-RESOURCES()



NAME
       describe-stack-resources -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns  Amazon  Web  Services  resource  descriptions  for running and
       deleted stacks. If StackName is specified, all the associated resources
       that are part of the stack are returned. If PhysicalResourceId is spec-
       ified, the associated resources of the stack that the resource  belongs
       to are returned.

       NOTE:
          Only  the  first  100  resources will be returned. If your stack has
          more resources than this, you should use ListStackResources instead.

       For deleted stacks, DescribeStackResources returns resource information
       for up to 90 days after the stack has been deleted.

       You must specify either StackName or PhysicalResourceId , but not both.
       In addition, you can specify LogicalResourceId to filter  the  returned
       result. For more information about resources, the LogicalResourceId and
       PhysicalResourceId , go to the CloudFormation User Guide .

       NOTE:
          A ValidationError is returned if  you  specify  both  StackName  and
          PhysicalResourceId in the same request.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-stack-resources
          [--stack-name <value>]
          [--logical-resource-id <value>]
          [--physical-resource-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --stack-name (string)
          The  name  or the unique stack ID that is associated with the stack,
          which aren't always interchangeable:

          o Running stacks: You can specify either the  stack's  name  or  its
            unique stack ID.

          o Deleted stacks: You must specify the unique stack ID.

          Default: There is no default value.

          Required:  Conditional.  If  you  don't specify StackName , you must
          specify PhysicalResourceId .

       --logical-resource-id (string)
          The logical name of the resource as specified in the template.

          Default: There is no default value.

       --physical-resource-id (string)
          The name or unique identifier that corresponds  to  a  physical  in-
          stance ID of a resource supported by CloudFormation.

          For  example,  for  an  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance,
          PhysicalResourceId corresponds to the InstanceId . You can pass  the
          EC2 InstanceId to DescribeStackResources to find which stack the in-
          stance belongs to and what other resources are part of the stack.

          Required: Conditional. If you don't specify PhysicalResourceId , you
          must specify StackName .

          Default: There is no default value.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 Information about whether the resource's actual configuration
                 differs, or has drifted , from its expected configuration, as
                 defined in the stack template and  any  values  specified  as
                 template  parameters. For more information, see Detecting Un-

                       sources  that  do not currently support drift detection
                       have a status of NOT_CHECKED .  For  more  information,
                       see Resources that Support Drift Detection .

                     o IN_SYNC  :  The resource's actual configuration matches

                     drifted from its expected configuration.

              ModuleInfo -> (structure)
                 Contains information about the module from which the resource
                 was created, if the resource was created from  a  module  in-
                 cluded in the stack template.

                 TypeHierarchy -> (string)
                     A  concatenated list of the module type or types contain-
                     ing the resource. Module types are listed  starting  with
                     the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module  of  type  AWS::First::Example::MODULE  ,   that's
                     nested  inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Exam-
                     ple::MODULE .

                     modules  containing  the  resource.  Modules  are  listed
                     starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated
                     by / .

                     In the following example, the resource was created from a
                     module,  moduleA  , that's nested inside a parent module,
                     moduleB .
                        moduleA/moduleB
