SYNOPSIS
            register-publisher
          [--accept-terms-and-conditions | --no-accept-terms-and-conditions]
          [--connection-arn <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --accept-terms-and-conditions | --no-accept-terms-and-conditions (bool-
       ean)
          Whether  you  accept  the Terms and Conditions for publishing exten-
          sions in the CloudFormation registry. You must accept the terms  and
          conditions  in order to register to publish public extensions to the
          CloudFormation registry.

          The default is false .

       --connection-arn (string)
          If you are using a Bitbucket or GitHub account for identity  verifi-
          cation,  the  Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for your connection to that
          account.

          For more information, see Registering your account to publish Cloud-
          Formation extensions in the CloudFormation CLI User Guide .

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.
