ROUTE53RESOLVER()                                            ROUTE53RESOLVER()



NAME
       route53resolver -

DESCRIPTION
       When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS reso-
       lution within the VPC from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver  an-
       swers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2 in-
       stances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs re-
       cursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain names.

       You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network
       over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:
          Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route  53  Re-
          solver

       DNS  resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a
       specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve  domain
       names  for  Amazon  Web  Services  resources  such  as EC2 instances or
       records in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For  more  information,  see
       How  DNS  Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Re-
       solver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .
          Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on  your  net-
          work

       You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2
       instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward se-
       lected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names
       for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and
       the  IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to
       forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com,
       acme.example.com),  Resolver  chooses  the  rule with the most specific
       match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query  to  the  IP  addresses
       that you specified in that rule. For more information, see How Route 53
       Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to  Your  Network  in  the
       Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide .

       Like  Amazon  VPC,  Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have
       VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to  your
       network  (outbound  queries),  from  your network to your VPCs (inbound
       queries), or both.
