NAME
       describe-anomaly -

DESCRIPTION
       Returns details about an anomaly that you specify using its ID.

       See also: AWS API Documentation

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

SYNOPSIS
            describe-anomaly
          --id <value>
          [--account-id <value>]
          [--cli-input-json <value>]
          [--generate-cli-skeleton <value>]

OPTIONS
       --id (string)
          The ID of the anomaly.

       --account-id (string)
          The ID of the member account.

       --cli-input-json  (string) Performs service operation based on the JSON
       string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by  --gen-
       erate-cli-skeleton.  If  other  arguments  are  provided on the command
       line, the CLI values will override the JSON-provided values. It is  not
       possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as
       the string will be taken literally.

       --generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a  JSON  skeleton  to  standard
       output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the
       value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument
       for  --cli-input-json.  If provided with the value output, it validates
       the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.

       See 'aws help' for descriptions of global parameters.

                 (structure)
                     Details about Performance Insights metrics.

                     Amazon  RDS  Performance  Insights enables you to monitor
                     and explore different dimensions of database  load  based
                     on  data  captured from a running DB instance. DB load is
                     measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights
                     provides  the  data to API consumers as a two-dimensional
                     time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB  load
                     data  for each time point in the queried time range. Each
                     time point decomposes overall load in relation to the re-
                     quested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples
                     include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

                       DB instances, go to the Amazon RDS User Guide .

                     MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                        The name used for a specific Performance Insights met-
                        ric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit of measure for a metric. For example, a ses-
                        sion or a process.

                     MetricQuery -> (structure)
                        A single query to be processed  for  the  metric.  For
                        more           information,           see           ``
                        PerformanceInsightsMetricQuery `` .

                        Metric -> (string)
                            The name of the meteric used used when querying an
                            Performance  Insights  GetResourceMetrics  API for
                            anomaly metrics.

                            Valid values for Metric are:

                            o db.load.avg - a  scaled  representation  of  the
                              number  of  active sessions for the database en-
                              gine.

                            o db.sampledload.avg - the raw  number  of  active
                              sessions for the database engine.

                            If  the  number of active sessions is less than an
                            internal    Performance    Insights     threshold,
                            db.load.avg  and  db.sampledload.avg  are the same
                            value. If the number of active sessions is greater
                            than  the internal threshold, Performance Insights
                            samples  the  active  sessions,  with  db.load.avg
                            showing   the  scaled  values,  db.sampledload.avg
                            showing the  raw  values,  and  db.sampledload.avg
                            less  than  db.load.avg  . For most use cases, you
                            can query db.load.avg only.

                        GroupBy -> (structure)
                            The specification for how to  aggregate  the  data
                            points from a Performance Insights GetResourceMet-
                            rics API query. The Performance Insights query re-
                            turns all of the dimensions within that group, un-
                            less you provide the names of specific  dimensions
                            within  that group. You can also request that Per-
                            formance Insights return a limited number of  val-
                            ues for a dimension.

                            Group -> (string)
                               The name of the dimension group. Its valid val-
                               ues are:

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of Amazon Web Services resources supported by De-
              vOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collec-
              tions  supported  are  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to indicate that the resources are related. For ex-
                 ample, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB  ta-
                 ble  resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more
                 information about using tags, see the Tagging best  practices
                 whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your resource coverage must begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                     vops-guru-  .  The  tag  key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and a key named De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your  appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                     TagValues -> (list)
                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production , or a team name). The key  and  value  are
                        the tag's key pair. Omitting the tag value is the same
                        as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,  tag  values
                        are  case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256
                        characters for a tag value.

                 (structure)
                     Details about Performance Insights metrics.

                     Amazon  RDS  Performance  Insights enables you to monitor
                     and explore different dimensions of database  load  based
                     on  data  captured from a running DB instance. DB load is
                     measured as average active sessions. Performance Insights
                     provides  the  data to API consumers as a two-dimensional
                     time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB  load
                     data  for each time point in the queried time range. Each
                     time point decomposes overall load in relation to the re-
                     quested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples
                     include SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.

                     MetricDisplayName -> (string)
                        The name used for a specific Performance Insights met-
                        ric.

                     Unit -> (string)
                        The  unit of measure for a metric. For example, a ses-
                        sion or a process.

                     MetricQuery -> (structure)

                        Metric -> (string)
                            The name of the meteric used used when querying an
                            Performance  Insights  GetResourceMetrics  API for
                            anomaly metrics.

                            Valid values for Metric are:

                            o db.load.avg - a  scaled  representation  of  the
                              number  of  active sessions for the database en-
                              gine.

                            o db.sampledload.avg - the raw  number  of  active
                              sessions for the database engine.

                            If  the  number of active sessions is less than an
                            internal    Performance    Insights     threshold,
                            db.load.avg  and  db.sampledload.avg  are the same
                            value. If the number of active sessions is greater
                            than  the internal threshold, Performance Insights
                            samples  the  active  sessions,  with  db.load.avg
                            showing   the  scaled  values,  db.sampledload.avg
                            showing the  raw  values,  and  db.sampledload.avg
                            less  than  db.load.avg  . For most use cases, you
                            can query db.load.avg only.

                        GroupBy -> (structure)

                            rics API query. The Performance Insights query re-
                            turns all of the dimensions within that group, un-

          ResourceCollection -> (structure)
              A  collection  of Amazon Web Services resources supported by De-
              vOps Guru. The two types of Amazon Web Services resource collec-
              tions  supported  are  Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks
              and Amazon Web Services resources that contain the  same  Amazon
              Web  Services  tag. DevOps Guru can be configured to analyze the
              Amazon Web Services resources that are defined in the stacks  or
              that  are  tagged using the same tag key . You can specify up to
              500 Amazon Web Services CloudFormation stacks.

              CloudFormation -> (structure)
                 An array of the names of Amazon Web  Services  CloudFormation
                 stacks.  The stacks define Amazon Web Services resources that
                 DevOps Guru analyzes. You can specify up to  500  Amazon  Web
                 Services CloudFormation stacks.

                 StackNames -> (list)
                     An array of CloudFormation stack names.

                     (string)

              Tags -> (list)
                 The  Amazon  Web  Services tags that are used by resources in
                 the resource collection.

                 Tags help you identify and organize your Amazon Web  Services
                 resources. Many Amazon Web Services services support tagging,
                 so you can assign the same tag to  resources  from  different
                 services  to indicate that the resources are related. For ex-
                 ample, you can assign the same tag to an Amazon DynamoDB  ta-
                 ble  resource that you assign to an Lambda function. For more
                 information about using tags, see the Tagging best  practices
                 whitepaper.

                 Each Amazon Web Services tag has two parts.

                 o A  tag key (for example, CostCenter , Environment , Project
                   , or Secret ). Tag keys are case-sensitive.

                 o An optional field  known  as  a  tag  value  (for  example,
                   111122223333  ,  Production , or a team name). Omitting the
                   tag value is the same as using an empty  string.  Like  tag
                   keys , tag values are case-sensitive.

                 Together these are known as key -value pairs.

                 WARNING:
                     The string used for a key in a tag that you use to define
                     your resource coverage must begin  with  the  prefix  De-
                     vops-guru-  .  The  tag  key might be Devops-guru-deploy-
                     ment-application or Devops-guru-rds-application  .  While
                     keys are case-sensitive, the case of key characters don't
                     matter to DevOps Guru. For  example,  DevOps  Guru  works
                     with  a  key  named  devops-guru-rds  and a key named De-
                     vOps-Guru-RDS . Possible key /value pairs in your  appli-
                     cation might be Devops-Guru-production-application/RDS or
                     Devops-Guru-production-application/containers .

                        The values in an Amazon Web Services tag collection.

                        The tag's value is an optional field used to associate
                        a string with the tag key (for example, 111122223333 ,
                        Production , or a team name). The key  and  value  are

                        as using an empty string. Like tag keys ,  tag  values
                        are  case-sensitive.  You can specify a maximum of 256
                        characters for a tag value.
